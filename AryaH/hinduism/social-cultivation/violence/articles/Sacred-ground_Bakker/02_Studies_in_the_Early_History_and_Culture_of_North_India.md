## A Theatre of Broken Dreams 

Vidiśā in the Days of Gupta Hegemony 

Prologue 

In his monumental Geschichte Indiens Hermann Kulke depicts the relation ship between the Gupta and Vākāṭaka dynasties as basically an unproblematic one, an alliance that was dominated by the Guptas and secured a peaceful coexistence till their fall. 

Vermutlich in der Phase der Vorbereitung seines Krieges gegen die Kshatrapa gab dann aber Candragupta seine Tochter dem K¨onig Rudrasena II. zur Ehe, um den Rücken für seinen Kampf im Westen frei zu habeṇRudrasena starb jedoch schon nach fünfjähriger Regierung etwa im Jahre 390 ṇChr. Auf Candraguptas Rat hin übernahm daraufhin seine Tochter Prabhavatigupta die Regentschaft für ihre S¨ohne. Während ihrer etwa zwanzigjährigen Regentschaft geriet das Vakataka Reich zunehmend unter direkten einfluß der Gupta und geh¨orte de facto bald zu deren Reichsverband. Zwar wurde die Unabhängigkeit der Vakatakas unter Pravarasena II. (ca. 410 bis 440 ṇChr.), von dem eine große Zahl Inschriften bekannt ist, wiederhergestellt. Doch hatte das Reich der Vakatakas aufgeh¨ort, eine potentielle Bedrohung für die Guptas zu seiṇBis zum Untergang der Guptas bestanden statt dessen überaus enge Beziehungen zwischen beiden Reichen, so daß man in der Geschichtsschreibung bisweilen sogar vom Vakataka-Gupta-Zeitalter spricht. Diese engen Beziehungen trugen wesentlich zur Ausbreitung der Gupta Kultur nach Zentralindien bei. (Kulke 1998, 114) 

This representation (including the chronology) reaches back to a powerful, his torical theory set forth by A.ṢAltekar in a book which he edited together with R̥C. Majumdar and which was first published in 1960 under the title The Vākāṭaka–Gupta Age. The evidence that has come to light in the last forty years justifies a reassessment of it. In Religion and Politics in the Eastern Vākāṭaka Kingdom (Bakker 2002) I investigated the actual lines along which Gupta culture reached the Deccan and how Gupta examples of religious and artistic expression informed those of the Vākāṭakas. This study has confirmed the last quoted statement of Hermann Kulke to the effect that the close relations between both kingdoms significantly contributed to a process of acculturation.

The historical question that should next be investigated is for how long, and in which way, these close relations prevailed between both kingdoms. Did they really last till the fall of the Guptas? We shall try to answer this question in the following pages as a tribute to the great historiaṇWe shall focus in particular on Eastern Malwa and its capital Vidiśā, since this appears to have been the theatre in which aspirations to the Gupta throne were fostered and shattered and in which Vākāṭaka presence made itself most expressly felt. 

Act 1 

Ramagupta ¯ 

In our reappraisal of the historic image sketched above, we may start on the war of Candragupta II with the Kṣatrapas or Sakas. Candragupta’s father, Samu- ´ dragupta, had extended his home territory—to be located along the Ganges, around Kauśāmbī-Prayāga, with Sāketa (present Ayodhyā) in the north and Pāṭaliputra (present Patna) in the east—towards the west by subduing i.a. the Nāga kingdom and its capital Padmāvatī (modern Pawaya), a kingdom or confederacy which seems to have comprised local Nāga families ruling from the cities of Kāntipurī (modern Kutwar) and Vidiśā (modern Besnagar). 1 The confederacy, if that it was, may have been led by the king of Padmāvatī, Gaṇapatināga, who, according to the famous Allahabad Pillar Inscription, was forcefully dethroned (prasabhoddharaṇa). 2 The three Nāga cities, Kāntipurī to the North and Vidiśā to the South of Padmāvatī, mark roughly the broad stroke of land to the West of Bundelkhand, south of the Chambal River and north of the Narmadā. The southern part of this country includes the north eastern Malwa Plateau, the fertile land around Vidiśā known as Daśārṇa; its western frontier borders on the central Malwa Plateau with its capital Ujjayinī (Ujjain). This plateau, which came to be called (Western) Malwa, was appar ently not annexed by Samudragupta to his kingdom. Behind the tribes of the Mālavas, Arjunāyanas, and Yaudheyas, listed in the Allahabad Inscription and ¯ said to be ruled by tributary ‘frontier-kings’ (pratyantanr̥pati), loomed a more formidable enemy, the Saka king, probably ´ mahākṣatrapa Rudrasena III, who in the same inscription is said to have acknowledged Samudragupta by paying his respect (◦sevākr̥ta◦). The city of Vidiśā thus appears to have been some sort of a frontier town by the end of Samudragupta’s reign and this may partly explain the great importance attached to control over it and the surrounding country throughout the rest of Gupta history.

2 CII III (1888), 7. Many coins of Gaṇapati (Gaṇapatīndra, Gaṇendra) have been found in Pawaya (Trivedi 1957, 5’, xxii-xxiii, 49–54). The Harṣacarita (ed. Kane p. 50 ll. 18 f.) mentions as the ruler of Padmāvatī that was killed Nāgasena (who also figures in the Allahabad Inscription), but so far no coins of him have been found. Cf. Bakker 1997, 10 f.

It is very much probable that the Mahākṣatrapa was little pleased with his subordinate status and his disaffection may have led to a military campaign when he judged the situation to be most favourable, that is, directly before or after Samudragupta’s death in c. ad 376. That such a campaign and the ensuing Gupta–Saka war(s) took place we only know from circumstantial evi- ´ dence. More than 250 years later a general of Harṣa’s army narrates in Bāṇa’s Harṣacarita the treachery and intrigue that befell earlier kings, among which the renowned act of Candragupta who ‘cut down the lord of the Sakas, who ´ desired another man’s wife, by disguising himself in her dress’. 3 Rather than remembering an historical event, Bāṇa may have discussed what was known to him from a play, written only a few decades before by a dramatist at the court of one of Harṣa’s predecesors (the Maukhari king Avantivarman), namely the Devīcandragupta of Viśākhadatta. 4 

The story of the Devīcandragupta 

The reconstruction of events directly after Samudragupta’s death almost fully depends on an historical assessment of this play, which itself, unfortunately, is lost, but which has been reconstructed from quoted fragments and brief references to it in other sources (among which the Harṣacarita). This recon struction, admirably carried out by V. Raghavan (1963, 858–80), and discussed by many scholars (e.g. Warder 1989–92 III, 260–64), may be briefly summerized as follows. 

A Gupta rāja, named Rāma, is threatened in his military camp by a ruler 

(pati) of the Sakas. He is forced to surrender his wife Dhruvadevī to the ´ 

Saka ruler. His younger brother ( ´ kumāra), called Candra, is unable to 

accept the disgrace and resorts to a ruse to kill the Saka chief. In the ´ 

disguise of the queen he enters the camp of the enemy and kills the Saka. ´ 

This act of boldness (sāhasa) earns him the title Sāhasāṅka. For reasons 

unknown Candra, after his heroic deed, seems to be in danger again, 

which this time is coming from within the Gupta camp. He resorts to 

feigning madness. The end of the play is not known. 

The main characters of this play are known as historical persons: Rāmagupta, his (younger) brother Candragupta, the latter’s wife Dhruvadevī, and the Sakapati, not mentioned by name, but who may have been thought to be ´ Rudrasena III. The play thus seems to have an unusually high historic profile.

4 Warder 1989–92 III, 257. Winternitz 1920, 210, especially n. 3 with regard to the date of Viśākhadatta in connection with the featuring of the name ‘Candragupta’ in the final blessing spoken by the chief actor (i.e. Rākṣasa) in some MSS of another of Viśākhadatta’s plays, the Mudrārākṣasa (in which Candragupta Maurya is one of the principal characters); other MSS read ‘Avantivarmā’ instead (discussion by Dhruva in his edition pp. ix–xv). I follow Dhruva and Warder in this matter. 









The historical assessment is complicated by two allusions made in Rāṣṭrakūṭa inscriptions dating from ad 871 and 933. The praśastis of the kings Amoghavarṣa I and Govinda IV seek to elevate their protagonists by comparing their deeds with the miserable behaviour of the foremost of the Gupta dynasty. The two verses run as follows. 

After killing his brother, he took (his) kingdom and (his) wife; even so the wretch had recorded surely, a thousand billion times, in the Kali Age: ‘A member of the Gupta family, he is the donor.’ The man (on the other hand), who gave his kingdom away more than once, a trifling thing (for him)—not to mention (other) external objects—he blushed, when merely the report went that their donor was the exalted ornament of the Rāṣṭrakūṭa dynasty (i.e. Amoghavarṣa). 5 

Though it was within his power, neither did he contrive outrageous cruelty against his elder brother, nor did he (ever) bring shame (upon himself) by despicable acts such as sleeping with the wife of his next of kin, nor did he betake himself out of fear to demoniac behaviour, irrespective of the holy and unholy alike—by liberality and unequalled acts of boldness that (king Govinda) became on earth a (true) ‘man-marked-by-boldness’ (Sāhasāṅka). 6 

To go by these verses, Candragupta not only killed the Sakapati and then ´ feigned madness, but he killed his brother Rāmagupta as well, took his wife, and usurped the throne. There is nothing in Viśākhadatta’s play that suggests that its hero Candra in the last, lost act turned into such a villain all at once; or as Warder remarks: 

As for Viśākhadatta, it would seem to have been very difficult to have concluded his play with such an action by his hero. He surely arranged the plot in such a way as to free Candra from guilt. 7 

Though the praśastis are of course specimina of blatant propaganda couched in poetry, it is equally difficult to imagine that the two Deccan kings actually invented such disgraceful acts altogether. In view of what was at stake at this crucial junction, viz. the preservation of the paternal heritage established at great costs, and in the light of similar events later in the Gupta history that we are going to discuss, it seems not wholy unlikely that the Rāṣṭrakūṭa kings

did actually divulge an historic stain on the otherwise so glorious reputation of the Gupta dynasty. That Rāmagupta ruled for a short period is undeniable. Candragupta’s chief wife was called Dhruvadevī, and her husband became mas ter over the Gupta Empire, including not only Vidiśā, but, eventually, also the realm of the Saka kings. ´ 

There is therefore every appearance that Samudragupta’s old age or death initiated a struggle for power in which at first the elder son, Rāmagupta, who as a viceroy might have been in charge of his father’s troups at the western frontier, was on top. To mark his position and to finance it he had begun issuing his own coinage, for which he used the local mints that earlier struck the copper coins of the Nāga kings. 8 Rāmagupta did not succeed, however, in extending his control over the whole of the Gupta kingdom. As Ellen Raven (1994a, 163 n. 4.66) remarks: ‘Perhaps the copper coins of King Rāmagupta also belong to the imperial currency, but the lay-out of their devices does not support such an attribution.’ The imperial mints still beyond his reach, at home, in his own power base Vidiśā, Rāmagupta could adorn himself with the grand titles to which he claimed the right. Mahārājādhirājaśrīrāmagupta was engraved on the pedestals of three Jaina images found in the village of Durjanpura in Vidisha District, 2 miles from Besnagar, proclaiming that these three images were ordered (kārita) by the ‘emperor’ himself. 9 

Candragupta’s matrimonial policy and the triangle of power 

The failure on the part of Rāmagupta to consolidate his power may have been caused by adverse developments in his war against the Sakas. As the drama ´ Devīcandragupta and references to it suggest, Candragupta’s coup d’´etat fol lowed after he had rescued the course of the Guptas. Subsequently, in addition to silver and copper coins minted locally in Malwa, Candragupta, as has been suggested, 10 began issuing his so-called Lion-slayer Type of imperial gold coins 

8 Bajpai 1992, 84: ‘The excavations at Vidisha, conducted by the ASI have also brought to light copper coins of Rāmagupta, similar in size and fabric to the Eraṇcoins of that ruler. . . . After the conquest of the Nāga territories and after the death of Samudragupta, coins of Rāmagupta were struck in mints of the region previously occupied by the Nāgas.’ 

9 Gai 1969. Mirashi 1982b. The three inscriptions on the pedestals read basically the same: 

bhagavato h’irhataḥpuṣpadantasya [image A & C: candraprabhasya] pratimeyaṁkā ritā mahārājādhirājaśrīrāmaguptena upadeśāt pāṇipātrikacandrakṣam(an. )ācāryakṣa maṇaśramaṇapraśiṣya-ācāryasarpasenakṣamaṇaśiṣyasya golakyāntyāhḥi satputrasya celūkṣamaṇasyeti k 

It seems that image B (or C) served as an exemplar for the image A, because the irregular saṁdhi between rāmaguptena upadeśāt is explained by B, where these words are separated by an image of a cakra; similar the irregular saṁdhi between praśiṣya-ācārya in A can be explained by the assumption (but the text has been erased here) that in B the word ācārya was written on a new line. The reading in A candrakṣamācārya seems haplography of reading in B: candrakṣamaṇācārya. For a translation and discussion of these lines see below, p. 321. 10 Majumdar 1954, 22. Cf. Raven 1994a I, 48 f., n. 2.125. 







to commemorate this victory, though this remains highly conjectural. If Candragupta thus appeared successful where Rāmagupta failed, this may have had to do with the greater political skills of the former. Candragupta was in a better position to hold on to the enemies defeated by his father, because he was married to one of their princesses, Kuberanāgā, on whom he confered the title of mahādevī.11 These Nāgas remained a local force to be reckoned with, despite their subjugation, and their help against their former arch-enemies, the Sakas, may have been a decisive factor. The same political skill, namely ´ to turn old enmities into effective alliances through matrimony, was again displayed by Candragupta when he, after he had consolidated his power, married off his own daughter by his Nāga wife to the house of the Vākāṭakas, another old enemy of his father. The marriage between Candragupta’s daughter Prabhāvatī Guptā and Rudrasena II took place around ad 388. 12 It seems plausible that especially Candragupta’s relation with the Nāgas through his wife secured him victory over the Sakas at long last, whereas his alliance ´ with the Vākāṭakas may have provided the necessary backing, as has been argued by Kulke. 13 This alliance may be viewed as a display of strength rather than of weakness. It not only established family ties between the Guptas and the Vākāṭakas, but also tied together the Vākāṭakas and the Nāgas. In all her inscriptions Prabhāvatī took great pride in her Gupta and Nāga ancestry. 14 

In this way came into being the geopolitical triangle that would determine the ramifications of power in the Gupta Empire during the greater part of the fifth century: 1) the Gupta homeland along the Ganges (centring on Kauśāmbī–Prayāga), 2) the strategic southern part of the homeland of the Nāga dynasty (the area around Vidiśā), 3) Vidarbha to the south of the Nar madā, across the Satpura Range (centring on Nandivardhana, residence of the Eastern Vākāṭakas). 

11 Bakker 1997, 11 f. Below, n. 14 on p. 306. 

12 Bakker 1997, 16. 

13 Jain 1972, 236: 

The great success achieved by the Gupta emperor is indirectly attested to by his coins. The long series of coins testifying to the almost unbroken rule of the Western Kshatrapas, for more than three hundred years, comes to an end between 388 and 397 ad, and is replaced by the coin of a similar design, issued by Candragupta II. The earliest silver coins of Candragupta are of the year 409 ad, issued to replace the coins of the Western Kshatrapas in Malwa. 

It would thus appear that Candragupta did not deal the final blow to the Sakas before ´ the middle of the first decade of the 5th century. This is indirectly confirmed by the late date by which Candragupta established his authority over Mandasor (see below, n. 17 on p. 308).

Act 2 

Govindagupta 

Candragupta, thus in charge of the greater part of northern India, appointed another viceroy (mahārāja) in Vidiśā to succeed Rāmagupta. There may have been several viceroys during his reign about whom we do not possess any infor mation at all, but it seems likely that Mahārāja Govindagupta, son by his chief queen Dhruvadevī, was prominent among them. Govindagupta is known from a clay seal of Dhruvasvāminī found from Vaiśālī which reads: ‘The illustrious Mahādevī Dhruvasvāminī, wife of the illustrious emperor Candragupta and mother of the illustrious Mahārāja Govindagupta.’ 15 The title mahārāja may designate the status of governor or viceroy, whereas the fact that the queen mother mentions him explicitly on her seal seems to suggest that he might even have been heir-apparent. 

The testimony of Prabhākara 

And there is more evidence. An inscription of a feudatory chieftain (bhūmipati) of Skandagupta, Prabhākara, found in Daśapura (modern Mandasor) in west ern Malwa (dating from ad 467/68), makes it probable that Govinda was gover nor of the western division of Candragupta’s empire, i.e. Malwa. The Mandasor Inscription of Mālava Saṁvat 524 reports: 

There was a king that resembled the moon (candra) in the firmament of the Gupta lineage by the renowned name of Srī Candragupta; he captured the eyes of the ´ people like the rising mooṇAfter he had snatched away from (many local) princes (pati) their kingship over the earth by brilliant and powerful means, he ensnared the earth with the help of members of his own dynasty; until today it has not yet liberated itself (from these bonds). That Lord of the Earth (i.e. Candragupta), the majesty of whose virtues resembled that of Govinda (i.e. Kr̥ṣṇa), begat a son who well-deserved the name of Govindagupta and who equaled the sons of Diti and Aditi (i.e. the Asuras and Devas). When kings bowed their heads to his (i.e. Govindagupta’s) lotusfeet—their splendours sinking down—even the Lord of the Gods (i.e. Indra), beset by doubts, ascended the swing of (fearful) deliberation. 16 

The commander of Govinda’s army that held these feudatory kings in check, the inscription tells us, was Vāyurakṣita. The chieftain Prabhākara came to employ

his son Dattabhaṭa as his general. There is something strange about this in scriptioṇIts author explicitly pledges allegiance to the Gupta emperor, who, at Prabhākara’s time, was Skandagupta, and sings the praises of Candragupta and Govindagupta, but is silent on Kumāragupta, Govindagupta’s brother. The in scription strongly suggests that the military services of Vāyurakṣita and his son Dattabhaṭa were not needed during the reign of Kumāragupta. Evidently the family fell into disgrace when Kumāragupta established suzerainty. This is corroborated by the fact that during Kumāragupta’s reign another feudatory family was in charge of Daśapura, viz. the Varmans or Early Aulikaras. 17 All this indicates that Candragupta’s succession had not been without a struggle. The contender for the imperial throne had again been an elder brother, the viceroy of Vidiśā, viz. Govindagupta. His general, Vāyurakṣita, thus turned out to have been on the losing side. 

The Mandasor Inscription, though prima facie loyal to Gupta rule, shows some ambiguities that might hint at Prabhākara’s uneasiness. First, in this charter this prince speaks of the snares (pāśa) laid over the earth (avapāśita) by the Guptas, from which it has not yet been able to free itself (mokṣaṁsamupaiti); on the lips of a feudatory, this has a dubious ring. Second, he tells us that Indra trembled at the sight of all the feudatories who bowed before Govindagupta. As has been suggested by Thaplyal (1972, 66), the allusion to Indra’s (Vibudhādhipa) fear, although a hyperbole not uncommon to this genre, may hint at Kumāragupta, whose biruda is ‘Mahendra’. 18 The assumed war of succession may have taken place in ad 415-416, 19 too short a period, it seems, for Govindagupta to issue his own coins. Kumāragupta, on the other hand, may have issued a special coin to commemorate his victory and to herald his ‘legitimate’ ascension to the imperial throne: it showed him (anachronistically) as an invincible (apratigha) youth blessed by his parents. 20 

17 Viśvavarman (Mālava Era 480 (ad 424): CII III (1888), 72–78) and Bandhuvarman (Mālava Era 493 (ad 437): CII III (1888), 79–88). This family reigned already in Daśapura before it was annexed by Candragupta to his kingdom, as the earliest inscrip tion of Naravarman seems to show: Mandasor Inscription of the Kr̥ta Year 461 (ad 404-05). In this inscription no reference to Gupta rule is found and I doubt whether the epithet siṁha-vikrānta-gāmin (clearly a pun on the name of his father Siṁhavarman) ‘shows that he (i.e. Naravarman) was a feudatory of Candragupta II’ as Bhandarkar, Chhabra and Gai want us to believe (CII III (1981), 263, 264 l. 5; cf. Sircar SI I, 398 n. 1). 

18 In the Tumain Inscription Kumāragupta, son of Candragupta, is styled mahendrakalpah. (CII III (1981), 278; see below, n. 21 on p. 310). The gold coins of Kumāragupta carry the biruda ‘śrīmahendra’ (Raven 1994a II, 104 ff.). 

19 The last dated inscription of Candragupta is from the Gupta year 93 (ad 413) (CII III (1888), 29–34: Sāñchi Stone Inscription), the first of Kumāragupta from Gupta year 96 (ad 416) (CII III (1888), 42–45: Bilsad. Stone Pillar Inscription).

Ashvini Agrawal 1992, who in discussing this type of coin remarks (p. 170): ‘The coin in the collection of the British Museum weighs only 115 grains and those of the Bayana hoard weigh between 120.5 and 123 grains, which is the lowest in the series of Kumāragupta’s gold coins except for a few

Plate 46 

Kumāragupta I: Apratigha Type gold coin 

In view of the postulated geopolitical triangle, it might be asked what role Vi darbha played in this power struggle. Kumāragupta’s sister, Prabhāvatī, ruled as a regentess for her minor sons in Nandivardhana at the time. Unfortunately our sources do not allow us to say anything with certainty in this matter. However, considering her close and peaceful relations with Kumāra throughout her life, one may speculate that Prabhāvatī stood on his side and it is not impossible that this may have contributed to his success. Her choice may have ensured that the local Nāgas in eastern Malwa too supported Kumāragupta’s claim to the throne. That Prabhāvatī and Kumāra were two hands in one glove may also be inferred from the following. 

Act 3 

Ghaṭotkacagupta 

After he had ousted his brother Govinda, Kumāragupta needed another viceroy in Vidiśā. Again it must be noted that there might have been viceroys during his reign of whom we do not possess any information at all, yet it is nearly certain that his younger brother, Ghaṭotkacagupta, was a prominent one among 

specimens of the Archer Type. Considering the fact that there was a gradual increase in weight of the Gupta gold coins till the time of Skandagupta, the Apratigha Type of coins have to be the earliest issues of Kumāragupta I.’ For another elaborate discussion in favour and against this interpretation see also Raven 1994a I, 41–44. Though the Apratigha coins were issued after the death of Candragupta, his image on the coins served the imperial propaganda by proclaiming that the young prince was elected by his father (and mother) himself. When studying this type of coin in the collection of the British Museum (Allan 1914, No. 257), I noticed that the male figure to Kumāra’s right, presumably his father King Candragupta, with a gesture of his right hand shows him the Garuḍa standard; the female figure to the left, his mother, in a similar hand gesture shows a small, indistinct object between thumb and index-finger, which I think could be a signet-ring (Plate 46). Cf. Raven 2004–05. 83; below, n. 36 on p. 316. 









them. This prince is known from the Tumain Inscription of Kumāragupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta, G.E. 116, which reads as follows. 

The son of the illustrious Candragupta, Kumāragupta, well-nigh the great Indra (Mahendra), protected the whole earth by holding her in his arms of power, as if she were his virtuous, lawful (dharma) wife. [. . . ] white [. . . ], that moon (candra) had risen by the name of Ghaṭotkacagupta, encircled by a halo that is the array of his virtues, [. . . ] (illuminating?) the sky and the earth. He, famous for the staunch vigour characteristic of his forbears, after reaping the fame that he had achieved by (his own) arms, [. . . ]. 21 

This inscription, which records the foundation of a temple in Tumbavana (mod ern Tumain) by a group of five brothers headed by Srīdeva in the Gupta year ´ 116 (ad 435-36), indicates that Ghaṭotkaca’s station was eastern Malwa, al though, just as of Govindagupta, a seal bearing his name was recovered from Vaiśālī. 22 The simile in which he is compared with another rising moon (can dra) suggests that Ghaṭotkaca too was a son of Candragupta. This is confirmed by the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription from Rāmagiri: 

At all times the conduct of this King (deva) Candragupta, Lord of the three oceans, was perfect: the sovereign (gave) his daughter [i.e. Muṇḍā/Prabhāvatī] to the illustrious Rudrasena, (a mine of) virtues (9). 23

To (this) sovereign (i.e. Candragupta)—a great hero, who was like a beast of burden, (carrying) the entire burden of (his) kingdom which was very difficult to bear—[. . . ], a son named Ghaṭotkaca was born (11). 24 

About this Ghaṭotkaca the inscription says that, 

(He pleased) the minds of wise men with refined language, [. . . ] of [. . . ] whose eyes were like (blue) lotuses [. . . ], mendicants with floods of wealth, and the peoples with (his) fame (15). 25

Ghaṭotkaca must have been considerably younger than Prabhāvatī, since the inscription suggests he was born after his sister’s marriage to the Vākāṭaka king. He therefore was a contemporary of Prabhāvatī’s childreṇWhen his elder brother Kumāra appointed him viceroy in Vidiśā in ad 416 or slightly later, he may have been about 25 years old. After the death of Rudrasena and Candragupta and Govinda’s elimination, Kumāragupta and his sister, the dowager queen of the Vākāṭakas, seized the opportunity to consolidate the geopolitical triangle, on which their power was based. They agreed to marry Prabhāvatī’s daughter, whose name may have been Atibhāvatī, to their younger brother Ghaṭotkaca, viceroy of Vidiśā. This extraordinary fact is unambigu ously reported in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription. 

Then, after he (i.e. Ghaṭotkaca) had seen that niece (bhāgineyī) (of his) [. . . ], who was a palace Lakṣmī, [. . . ] (this) king paid his respects (to her) and married her (13). 26 

The stability thus created ushered in three decades of unparallelled cultural bloom. It seems that it is this period in particular (c. ad 415–445) that gave rise to the image of a long-lasting, close and peaceful relationship between the Guptas and Vākāṭakas, first drawn up by Altekar and taken over by many other scholars, among whom Hermann Kulke, quoted above. 

Kālidāsa’s Mālavikāgnimitra 

Among the cultural achievements of the time were the plays of Kālidāsa. One of them stages momentous events of a remote past, the days in which the Suṅga ´ general Puṣyamitra usurped the Maurya Empire (c. 187–151 bc). However, as we will show, the contemporary spectators may have seen through this historic guise the political situation of their own days. In order to facilitate our analysis of this play, its contents may be briefly summarized, with the restriction that we leave the intrigue at the Vidiśā court, which is the play’s main plot, for what it is. 

A rāja rules in Vidiśā as viceroy, appointed as such by his father who, as 

commander-in-chief, senāpati, is about to consolidate his kingship by a 

horse sacrifice. To secure the horse the father extends his power to the 

extreme west, where his army successfully fights the Yavanas. The chief 

queen of the rāja of Vidiśā is apparently of indigenous Nāga stock—she 

is called Dhāriṇī, and her signet-ring bears the seal of a serpent (nāga). 

The viceroy of Vidiśā, heir-to-the-throne of the empire founded by his

father, with whom relations are good, is at loggerheads with his southern neighbour, the kingdom of Vidarbha. It appears that this kingdom is the domain of two rival branches of a family divided over the question how to deal with the new mighty northern neighbour. One branch had pledged allegiance (pratiśrutasaṁbandha) and had wished to enter into a matrimonial alliance, but this was initially prevented by the ruler of the other branch, who was temporarily in power and, through his in laws, allied to the party that was overthrown by the senāpati when he established his rule over northern India. 

The rāja of Vidiśā sends his brother-in-law, a bastard brother of Dhāriṇī (varṇāvara), to command a frontier post (antapāladurga) on the River Narmadā, evidently the border between the kingdoms of Vidiśā and Vi darbha. After an exchange of unsuccessful diplomatic missions, war breaks out between them. The inimical ruler (pati) of Vidarbha is con quered. The kingdom of Vidarbha is divided into two, and both rulers are installed as joint vassals of the rāja of Vidiśā, one ruling to the south, the other to the north of the Varadā River (the Warda). Peace is sealed by matrimony, when the rāja of Vidiśā marries the co-uterine sister (sodaryā) of the friendly ruler of Vidarbha, who thus lives up to her name, Mālavikā, and becomes a princess of the country of Mālava. 

No doubt the reader has recognized the play as the Mālavikāgnimitra, about which Warder remarks that its ‘modernity’, as claimed by Kālidāsa in the Prologue, perhaps consists in ‘this critical presentation of a prince, or perhaps in the presentation in the theatre of the new Gupta-Vākāṭaka politics of marriage alliances and vassal kingdoms, though in the guise of ancient history’ (Warder 1989–92 III, 129). 

The Mālavikāgnimitra was written for a Gupta audience rather than for a Vākāṭaka one. This is inferred from the fact that supremacy of the northern rulers, though challenged, is gloriously confirmed and the relationship between the sovereign and the viceroy in Vidiśā, despite the latter’s moral flaws, is represented as unproblematic, unlike the representation thereof in the post Gupta play Devīcandragupta (see above). 

An analysis of the background, against which the play is set, reveals the following elements that reflect the political arena of the first half of the fifth century that we have tried to sketch above. 

1 The major powers of the time are the northern empire and the kingdom of Vidarbha. The border between both kingdoms is formed by the River Narmadā. 

2 The political centre of the western part of the northern empire is Vidiśā, where the heir-to-the-throne rules as viceroy. 

3 This viceroy has tied the indigenous rulers of Malwa to his throne by taking one of their princesses as his chief wife. In Kālidāsa’s play this wife is called Dhāriṇī, a name that echos the gotra name, Dhāraṇa, of Prabhāvatī Guptā. The signet-ring of Dhāriṇī, which features a nāga, and plays an important role in the plot, reinforces this Nāga descent. The historicity of this detail may be 







14 / A Theatre of Broken Dreams 313 

illustrated by the signet-ring of Mahārāja Maheśvaranāga, son of Nāgabhaṭṭa (Plate 47). 27 

4 The attitude of the Vidarbha rulers (whose coronation names end in Sena) against their northern neighbours is ambivalent. One faction is inclined to come to terms with northern overlordship, the other has not forgotten its allegiance to the ancien r´egime, to the rulers who had been overthrown by the new sovereign. 

5 After hostilities between both kingdoms—the Narmadā is crossed— northern suzerainty is established by dividing the Vidarbha kingdom into two vassal states, one ruling to the north of the Varadā River, the other to the south of it. 

6 The establishment of the balance of power is sealed by the marriage of a Vidarbha princess with the viceroy of Vidiśā. 

  

  



Plate 47 A & B 

Signet-ring of Mahārāja Maheśvaranāga, son of Nāgabhaṭṭa (B mirrored) 

Attempts to read more in Kālidāsa’s drama and to connect its protagonists and actions with historical individuals and events is doomed to fail. The play is not an historic drama, and, if one wants to see it as such, it explicitly professes to be one concerned with a more distant past. The audiences of the fifth century may have recognized the general political reality of their times, though. It gave the play an exciting dimension and in that, as Warder remarked, its avowed innovation vis-`a-vis the works of the poet’s predecessors may have consisted. 

27 This copper seal in the form of a signet-ring was purchased by Cunningham from a local dealer in Lahore and to date forms part of the Cunningham Collection of the British Museum. It was published in CII III (1888), 282 f. and Plate XLIII A. It reads: [1] mahārājanāgabhaṭṭa [2] putramaheśvaranāgah.. The crescent to the left and bull in front of a liṅga in the upper half of the seal confirm that the Nāga kings were Saivas. The ´ name of the king is not known from other sources. It is conjectured that the indistinct tiny objects held in the right hands of the mothers of Kumāra and Skandagupta are such signet-rings (see n. 20 on p. 309 and n. 36 on p. 316). 









There is one element in the play that we have not yet encountered. This con cerns the internal division within the kingdom of Vidarbha and its partitioṇReturning from literature to history, we may observe that from the fourth century onwards one branch of the Vākāṭaka family ruled in Nandivardhana (near modern Ramtek), the other in Vatsagulma (modern Wasim). The border between both kingdoms was the River Varadā (modern Warda). We do not have enough evidence to know whether the Vākāṭakas were unanimous in their friendship towards their northern neighbours. A priori, this seems unlikely, particularly because the dynasty had lost much of its original land to Samu dragupta (Bakker 1997, 9–15). We do not know how much resistence there was against Prabhāvatī’s regency over her sons and whether there was resentment from the side of these sons against their mother, who seemingly indefinitely postponed (from c. ad 405 to 419) their ascension to the throne (Bakker 1997, 15 f.). Is it pure accident that in the aftermath of the power struggle between Govinda and Kumāragupta the Vākāṭaka crown-prince (yuvarāja) and eldest son of Prabhāvatī, Divākarasena, vanished from the scene, never to be heard of again? 28 And, finally, we do not know at what costs Prabhāvatī enforced the marriage of her daughter with her maternal uncle, Ghaṭotkaca. What we do know, however, is that after the death of this formidable lady (c. ad 443) Gupta–Vākāṭaka relations quickly deteriorated. 

The Vākāṭaka–Gupta conflict 

About ad 445 Prabhāvatī’s youngest son Pravarasena crossed the Narmadā and pitched his army camp (vāsaka) in Tripurī (modern Tewar) on the northern bank of this river, i.e. in Gupta territory. 29 To all appearances the tripartite alliance between Guptas, Nāgas, and Vākāṭakas, was beginning to erode. This might also have had to do with a new player that had entered the arena, Skandagupta, a bastard son of Kumāragupta. The Gupta emperor was growing old and the jockeying for the best position to succeed him had beguṇAs far as we know, there were at least three contenders for the throne. 1) Kumāra’s legal son by his chief wife Anantadevī, Pūrugupta, who at the time might still have been too young to play a significant part. 2) The emperor’s younger brother 

28 In the 13th year of Prabhāvatī’s regency (c. ad 417) Divākarasena was still recognized as yuvarāja. CII V, 7 ll. 9–10: yuvarāja[śrī]divākarasenajananī. The seal of these Poona Plates of Prabhāvatī runs (CII V, 8): ‘[By] the enemy chastising order of the Mother of the crown-prince, who is the ornament of the Vākāṭakas and has attained royal fortune by inheritance.’ (vākāṭakalalāmasya [kra]maprāptanr̥paśriya[h.] | jananyā yuvarājasya śā sanaṁripuśāsa[nam k ] ). Divākarasena is no longer mentioned as a son or king in the later charters of Prabhāvatī; in his stead two other sons of hers are called Mahārāja in two charters of land donations made in the nineteenth and twentieth regnal year of her son Pravarasena. In these inscriptions (CII V, 36 l. 10 (R. iddhapur Plates of Prabhā vatīguptā); Shastri & Kawadkar 2001, 135–151 (Miregāon Plates of Prabhāvatī Guptā, Year 20)), she describes herself as the ‘Mother of the Mahārājas of the Vākāṭakas, the illustrious Dāmodarasena and Pravarasena’. See below, n. 59 on p. 332. The Setubandha may contain an indication that the younger brother Pravarasena had a hand in Divā karasena’s disappearance (see Bakker 2008, Introduction).

Ghaṭotkaca, ruling in Vidiśā, and, 3) the outsider, a boy from the harem, Skandagupta. 

To stake his claims, Ghaṭotkaca may have begun to issue his own gold coins; one such coin can, with some amount of confidence, be ascribed to a Ghaṭo(tkaca), on which he wields the imperial Garuḍa standard and takes the biruda ‘Kramāditya’. 30 For the third time the Gupta Empire threatened to fall apart. I have analysed this episode elsewhere (Bakker 1997, 25–29). Here it may suffice to refer to the Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta in which, following Mirashi, we may find references to three wars conducted by Skandagupta. The first one records how Skandagupta, while his father Kumāra was still emperor, raised again the faltering fortune of his family (vicalitakula lakṣmī) by vanquishing his enemies. Mirashi took this as a reference to the Vākāṭakas and Pravarasena’s campaign on the northern banks of the Nar madā may have had to do with it. 31 I consider it most plausible that in the struggle for power between the centre—the yuvarāja Skandagupta (in lieu of Kumāragupta)—and the viceroy of Vidiśā, Pravarasena had chosen the side of his brother-in-law, Ghaṭotkaca. Another ally of the Vidiśā party was in all likelihood the faction of the local Nāgas. The civil war may have dragged on for a decade and may have intensified after the death of Kumāragupta when Skandagupta’s fortunes reached rock bottom (viplutāṁvaṁśalakṣmīm),32 but the end was a total defeat of Vidiśā. Skandagupta’s Junagaḍh Rock Inscrip tion contains a verse in which Skandagupta boasts about how ‘he was for ever triumphant, (when) he took the antidotal herb, namely the Garuḍa/imperial command, to fight against the Serpent Kings (i.e. the Nāgas) whose hoods were uplifted in pride and arrogance’. 33 and the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription reports the death of Ghaṭotkaca. 

30 P.ḶGupta 1946, 316: ‘The Leningrad Museum [possesses a coin] with the king on the obverse (nimbate, standing to left, holding bow in left hand and arrow in the right), Garuḍa standard is on the right of the king; beneath the left arm is inscribed Ghaṭo with a crescent above. It bears traces of marginal legend ending in (gu)pta(h. ). On the reverse of the coin is the Goddess (holding lotus in left hand and pāśa (fillet) in out stretched right hand) with a symbol on the top left corner. The legend on this side is not certain but seems to be kramāditya.’ Cf. Altekar 1954, 310. On account of its weight, 9.16 g (141.2 grains), Tandon 2014, 4 f. argues that this coin was ‘almost certainly issued some length of time after the accession of Skandagupta’. 

Another coin ascribed to Ghaṭotkaca was published by Ajit Ghosh in JNSI 22 (1960), 120 f. The attribution of this coin to Ghaṭotkaca is dubious; Ellen Raven reads skanda instead of ghaṭo and ascribes this coin to Skandagupta (personal communication). 

31 Mirashi 1982a, 70 f.; cf. Mirashi in JESI (1980), 86 ff. The interpretation of this verse is controversial. Fleet in CII III (1888), 53–54, ll. 10–11 reads: samuditabahlaikoṣān pu(ṣya)mitrāṁś ca hjiitvā; he takes this as a reference to the tribe of the Puṣyamitras. Fleet admitted in a note that the second syllable of the name was damaged. Mirashi 1982a (IRP I, 70), following a proposal of Divekar, conjectures the reading: samudita bahlaikośāhn yuddhy aimitrāṁś ca hjiitvā; that is, ‘after having vanquished in battle (yudhi) his enemies whose wealth and power had increased’, a reading accepted in the revised edition (1981) of CII III (p. 315 v. 4), but rejected by Agrawal 1989, 211. 

32 Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta l. 13 (CII III (1888), 54). See below, n. 35 on p. 316. 

33 CII III (1981), 302. Cf. Bakker 1997, 27. 







When at a certain time [. . . ] he of desirable appearance (i.e. Ghaṭotkaca) [. . . ] by/with Indra, [. . . ] (her) brother (i.e. Pravarasena) brought the proud woman (i.e. Atibhāvatī) [. . . ] back to his own residence with force (17). 34 

Finale 

Confronted with defeat, the political triangle, on which the stability and power of his kingdom was based, in ruins, the Vākāṭaka king Pravarasena made the most of a hopeless situation, marched on Malwa, brought his widowed sister back to Vidarbha in a military campaign, and died soon thereafter. In ad 455 Skandagupta officially succeeded his deceased father and proudly declared himself emperor. Frustration concerning his birth may have bred this great pride. In verse 6 of the Bhitarī Pillar Inscription, Skandagupta, after his victory (over his uncle Ghaṭotkaca), is said to have run towards his mother, ‘which made her weep like Devakī after Kr̥ṣṇa had killed his enemy’, namely his uncle (Kaṁsa). 35 This scene, as has been rightly suggested by Goyal, is depicted on Skandagupta’s so-called ‘King-and-Lakṣmī Type’ of gold coins, on which the lady to the left of the victorious warrior king, smaller than him and without a nimbus, may represent not the goddess Srī or Laks ´ .mī, but his anonymous mother. 36

Epilogue 

Our reappraisal of Gupta history in the light of the recurrent events in Vidiśā and the role of the Vākāṭakas in them has come to an end. The idyllic picture to the effect that the Gupta–Vākāṭaka relations were close till the fall of the imperial Gupta dynasty, i.e. till the end of the 5th century, stands in need of revisioṇIt has emerged that these relations were only intimate and peaceful during the lifetime of Prabhāvatī Guptā. Before and after the long period of more than half a century that this formidable lady dominated the stage (ad 388–443), these relations were marred by conflicting interests, which led to war at least twice, first under the reign of Samudragupta, when the Vākāṭakas lost much of their original territory in the Vindhyas, then again under his great grandson Skandagupta, when they were forced to give up their influence at the court of the viceroy of Vidiśā. Loss of the Malwa connection, and therewith of Gupta support altogether, resulted in disaster for the Eastern Vākāṭakas, who soon became subordinate to their relatives in Vatsagulma. 

Thus was Vidiśā, as we hope to have demonstrated, for at least eighty years (ad 375–455) a theatre of broken dreams, a stage on which three Gupta viceroys paid with their lives for their imperial aspirations, and from which, in a grand finale, a widowed Vākāṭaka princess was hurried away and brought to safety across the Narmadā River by the faltering troups of her brother.

## Royal Patronage and Religious Tolerance 

The Formative Period of Gupta–Vākāṭaka Culture 

Udayagiri 

When, at the beginning of the 5th century, the royal elephant carrying his majesty climbed the slopes of the Udayagiri for a visit to the sacred complex, Emperor Candragupta made sure not to give offence to any of the parties involved in his grand project. His aim was clearly defined in the inscription that records his visit, namely the winning of the entire earth: 

He (Vīrasena) has come here in the company of the king himself, who was on his way of winning the entire earth, and he has commissioned this cave out of devotion for Lord Sambhu. ´ 1 

Though himself a devotee of Viṣṇu and so a Bhāgavata, the king paid his respect to his learned chief minister Vīrasena, who came from Pāṭaliputra, by visiting the cave dedicated to Lord Sambhu, i.e. ´ Siva, which had recently be ´ completed under the patronage of the chief minister. The chief minister was content and proudly recorded the honour that had been bestowed upon him in an inscription at the back of the cave. However, this rather insignificant Cave 8, which probably enshrined a liṅga, can hardly have been the main purpose of Candragupta’s visit. 2 For, next door, around the corner, a truly grandiose scheme had just been, or was about to being accomplished, a work of art that was designed to broadcast the king’s larger ambition: ‘the winning of the entire earth’, expressed allegorically in the great Varāha panel of Cave 5. 

As Michael Willis (2004, 2009) has shown, the Varāha panel was intrinsically connected through a system of hydrological engineering with a natural cleft in the central ridge of the mountaiṇWater once cascaded down through this narrow passage, flowing underneath a large image of Viṣṇu–Nārāyaṇa. This panel shows the god in his cosmic sleep while resting on the primordial snake (Anantaśayana), floating on the cosmic oceaṇAt the bottom of the cascade, the water was collected in a resevoir at the feet of the Varāha sculpture of Cave 5, making the cosmic boar rise out of the waters.

It will not be our aim here to analyze the iconography and the allegori cal double-entendre of these two panels, the Varāha and the Nārāyaṇa, which most recently has been done by Willis in a penetrating study referred to above. 3 What concerns us here is the ecumenicity of the situation: a Vaiṣṇava king, ‘whose prowess is [Viṣṇu’s] Cakra’, 4 selects a prominent spot at the centre of the holy mountain of Udayagiri for celebrating his faith and political mission, and allows at the same time two leading figures of his kingdom, a minister (Vīrasena) and a vassal king (the Sanakānika mahārāja Soḍhala (?)), to con struct next door cave-sanctuaries (Caves 6 and 8) dedicated to Siva, the other ´ high god of Hinduism. Inscriptions in both shrines duly recognize the sover eignty of Candragupta. 5 Admittedly, we cannot be certain as to the original dedication of the sanctuary of Cave 6—the cave no longer contains its origi nal sculpture—but the two Viṣṇu images at the outer wall, flanking the two Dvārapālas, as well as the image of Gaṇeśa overviewing the entrance at the left and a shrine of the seven mothers at the right of the sanctum, strongly suggest that Cave 6 was also a Siva sanctuary, ´ 6 in which the two Viṣṇu images, in the words of Joanna Williams, were merely ‘attendant upon the greater glory of Siva’. ´ 7 

And, to complete the picture, adjacent to the Varāha cave on the other, southern side, was one more Saiva cave (4), enshrining an ´ ekamukhaliṅga.8 Thus it cannot have escaped the attention of the contemporaneous visitor that, with the establishment of Gupta power over the area, the Bhāgavata religion had taken pole position, not by ousting its Saiva rivals, but rather by including ´ them in a subordinate positioṇBy doing so the three caves together mirrored the situation in Cave 6 on a larger scale: Siva (Caves 4 & 6) ‘attendant on the ´ greater glory of’ the Bhagavat (Cave 5). Although the majority of the temple structures on the Udayagiri can be assigned to Hindu gods, this by no means excluded other persuasions to establish their own sanctuary on the hill. At the top of the north side of the hill is a cave of the heterodox Jains, which an inscription dates to the reign of Candragupta’s son Kumāragupta (ge 106 = ad 436). ‘The inscription records the dedication of an image of Pārśvanātha.’ 9

5 For the inscription in Cave 6 see Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 82, CII III (1888), 21–25. The name of the king, ‘Soḍhala’, is a conjecture of ḌC. Sircar (SI I, 279 n. 5.). No king of that name is known otherwise. It is uncertain whether ‘Soḍhala’s’ inscription refers to the construction of the cave sanctuary 6 as a whole. The inscription is placed above the Mahiṣāsuramardinī and one of the Viṣṇu images on the outer wall.

Jainism had been favoured in this region by Candragupta’s ill-fated elder brother, Rāmagupta, who commissioned the three images that were report edly found inside old Besnagar (Durjanpura), 1.5 km from Udayagiri. 10 Three inscriptions on the pedestals record basically the same dedication: 

This image of the Lord, the venerable Puṣpadanta/Candraprabha, was commis sioned by the Mahārājādhirāja Srī Rāmagupta, at the instigation of Celūks ´ .amaṇa, son of Golakyāntī, who is the pupil of the preceptor Sarpasenakṣamaṇa and the grand-pupil of the pāṇipātrika 11 Candrakṣamaṇa, preceptor (ācārya) and forbear ing monk (kṣamaṇaśramaṇa). 12 

No direct evidence of Buddhist presence in Udayagiri has come to light, the reason for which is not difficult to see: the great, ancient centre of Sanchi, 5 km to the south, naturally attracted all Buddhist devotioṇThis was, for instance, the case when another favourite of Candragupta, Amrakārdava, donated in ¯ ge 93 (= ad 413), 

An allotment of land, called ‘Īśvaravāsaka’, and a sum of money to the Arya- ¯ saṅgha, or community of the faithful, at the great vihāra or Buddhist convent of Kākanādaboṭa, for the purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps. 13 

Candragupta’s favours are explicitly said to have contributed to Amrakārdava’s ¯ way and means of life. 14 

Thus we possess within a circle of five kilometers from the Udayagiri Caves and within a time frame of a few decades around ad 400, plenty of epigraphical and sculptural evidence that proves that the reign of Samudragupta’s successors ushered in a period of royal patronage that was not limited to one religious de nomination only, but was beneficial to all the four major religions of the times: Bhāgavata (Visnuism), Māheśvara (Saivism), Jaina (Jainism) and Bauddha (Buddhism). This is not to say, of course, that the Guptas invented religious patronage, but their rule marked the emergence of kings and courtiers as a ma jor class of patrons, whereas earlier ‘groups of lay people’ were the prominent sponsors. 15 And in contrast to most of the earlier patrons, their patronage

pāṇipātrika I would not take as a title but rather as a eulogistic epithet signifying an ascetic who uses his cupped hands as an alms bowl and thus follows the jinakalpa, the rigorous mode of life of the Jinas. The term usually designates, or came to designate, a Digambara monk.

extended to religions other than their personal persuasions, thus spreading an atmosphere of religious tolerance throughout the realm. 16 

Royal patronage 

As we will see, this patronage could take the form of financing prestigious building projects as well as lending financial support to religious groups and individuals through gifts of money or land. We do not possess much direct evidence of courtly patronage of individual sculptors, decorators, architects or other artisans who worked in the visual arts, although this must have been substantial. They were paid, of course, and some artists more than others, no doubt. Since the king himself was the centre of the patronage system, it is remarkable that we do not possess epigraphical testimonies of Candragupta’s own building projects. It looks as if he was satisfied with being credited by his subjects for his goodness, whereas the ones that appear to have been his own monumental plans, such as the Varāha and Nārāyaṇa panels, were apparently so obvious that they needed no special commemoration in the form of dedicatory inscriptions. 

This large-scale and broad-minded religious patronage practised by the court, which involved the king, his courtiers and officials (amātya), favourites and so-called feudatories (sāmanta), 17 enhanced the development of the classical forms of the Indian religions, as well as their sacred architecture and art. It formed part of a wider system of patronage, which operated as a powerful political strategy, through which the king could advance and visualize a religiously sanctified social order (dharma), from which his authority as a ruler by God’s grace was deduced. 18 Partly due to this policy, North India became covered with religious monuments of various sorts, a small number of which survived the ages. The Gupta court and its satellites promoted a lifestyle and devotional ethos that obviously was appealing to a broad section 

16 Cf. A.K. Narain (1983) in Religious Policy and Toleration in Ancient India: ‘Toleration’ in this context means a state’s recognition and protection of the right of private judgement in matters of faith and worship, and a lack of persecution or obstruction of the beliefs and practices of sects and religions other than the king’s owṇOften the king of ancient India does not get credit for his act of toleration by modern historians beause it is wrongly assumed that toleration is an essential part of his religious practice or of rājadharma. (Narain 1983, 50) 

17 Ali 2004, 8: ‘It was the activities of the king’s court, composed of dependents and re tainers, and attented by underlords and vassals, which constituted “government” rather than a putative “administration”.’ 

18 See Bakker 1992d (above, p. 153). This should not be taken as support of a legitimation theory which, in the words of Daud Ali, ‘suggests the rather unlikely and even anachro nistic scenario of the court acting collectively on the basis of certain principles, and then representing them back to itself in order to legitimate them’. On the contary, we sub scribe to Ali’s insight that ‘the ideas enshrined in art and literature are in fact identical to the key concepts found in the texts which urge the king and his men to constitute their political actions, which is to say that the supposedly non-ideational realm of power and politics is in fact already ideational’. (Ali 2004, 14)

of the population; it proved not only to be politically effective, but it lent stability and grandeur to Gupta reign, thanks to which some still speak of ‘the golden age’, or ‘the classical age’. 19 

Mandhal 

This successful model set an attractive example for other dynasties to follow. Influence emanating from the Gupta realm becomes best visible in a dynasty to the south of the Vindhyas with which close relations were established, the Eastern Vākāṭakas of Vidarbha. 

Candragupta had married a princess of the Nāga dynasty (an old enemy of his father Samudra) named Kuberanāgā, by whom he had a daughter. This princess, who came to be known from her own inscriptions by her dynastic name Prabhāvatī Guptā, was married to the Vākāṭaka prince Rudrasena II in about ad 388. 20 The Nāgas had been a major force in Eastern Malwa and the region around Udayagiri–Vidiśā till the Gupta conquest, and the marriage of a Gupta Nāga princess with the crown-prince of the Vākāṭakas established a triangular political relationship between the centre of Gupta power in the Gaṅgā-Yamunā doab in the north, Vidiśā in the west, and the Eastern Vākāṭaka kingdom in the south. 21 

Rudrasena, once king, inspired it would seem by the example of his in-laws, reinforced a tradition of large-scale religious patronage within the Vākāṭaka kingdom. 22 Two inscriptions of Rudrasena himself bear testimony to this: the Deoṭek Stone Inscription of Rudrasena and the Mandhal Plates, Year 5. The Deotek palimpsest stone inscription (Rudrasena overwriting an inscription that 

19 Although Daud Ali admits that he has ‘bracketed out the question of religion’, he makes an important observation that is relevant to our subject: 

In fact, religious and political notions of lordship differed more in degree than kind. They formed part of a continuous and homologously structured ‘chain of being’ which linked the entire cosmos. This, on the one hand, meant that the king’s authority and mystique resembled and participated in that of the temple god, giving a theological dimension to relationships at court. On the other hand, however, it meant that the life of gods, housed in their sumptuous palaces, shared striking resemblances to those of princes. (Ali 2004, 104) 

I have earlier argued in a similar line, pointing out, however, that this notion of ‘lordship’ was itself part of a historical process, or, that the ‘degree’ of homology between gods and kings can be demonstrated to have evolved from an analogy in The Gupta/Vākāṭaka age to a full homology in the centuries before the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (Bakker 1992d, 99; above, p. 165).

apparently pertains to the reign of Aśoka) records the erection of a Dharma sthāna, evidently in the vicinity of present-day village Deotek on the Beṇṇā or Wainganga River. No further details of this building are knowṇForty kilometers to the north of it is the findspot of the second Rudrasena inscription, which was found while ploughing a field near the village of Mandhal. 23 

The locations of both inscriptions indicate that the earliest political heart of the Vākāṭaka kingdom was along the Wainganga, to the south of Nagpur. This may have been the Padmapura District that is known from two inscriptions, one of which is Rudrasena’s Mandhal Plates, the other the Māsod Plates of Pravarasena II, Year 19. Although the exact size and location of this district is unknown, the area around the present village of Mandhal no doubt belonged to it. 24 Padmapura itself must have been the capital of this district. This capital features in the so-called ‘Unfinished Durg Plate’ or Mohallā Plate. 25 Closer consideration of the Mohallā Plate leads to the hypothesis that Padmapura was the political centre of Rudrasena II’s reign. 

Padmapura 

After mentioning Padmapura as the place of issue, padmapurāt, the Mohallā Plate begins the dynastic genealogy, i.e. the praśasti of the Eastern Vākāṭaka kings in words that are identical to Rudrasena’s Mandhal Plates up to bhava nāgadauhitrasya (ll. 2–7), which refers to Rudrasena I. 26 The inscription breaks off abruptly; no other plates have come forward and the single plate found in Mohallā lacks the mark of approval:dr̥ṣṭam, although space had been reserved for it. 27 Untill now the Mohallā Plate was either ascribed to Pravarasena II or his son Narendrasena (proposed by Mirashi in: CII V, 77), or to Pr̥thivīṣeṇa I or his son Rudrasena II (Shastri 1997, 8), or to ‘a successor of Pravarasena II’ (Shrimali 1987, 113 n. 109). 

The discovery of Rudrasena II’s Mandhal Plates has revealed that the praśasti of the dynasty of the Eastern Vākāṭakas was already fully developed by Rudrasena II’s time, thus taking the edge off Mirashi’s argument (in: CII V, 77) that the praśasti of the Mohallā Plate resembles that of the grants of Pravarasena II. The wording of the praśasti resembles indeed the one found in Pravarasena II’s inscriptions, but it equally resembles the one of Rudrasena II’s charter. The box-headed palæography of the Mohallā Plate does also not significantly differ from the Mandhal Plates of Rudrasena, nor from Pravarasena’s plates for that matter. 28 However, Pravarasena’s charters

were issued from either Nandivardhana or Pravarapura. 29 

Pr̥thivīṣeṇa I, the most likely author of the Mohallā Plate according to Shas tri, 30 is an unlikely candidate in my view, since it is questionable whether this king already used the medium of copperplates to record his charters 31 —at least nothing has been found—although, admittedly, he might have been the founder of Padmapura. 32 

To finish our review of possible authors of the Mohallā Plate, there is Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, the only successor of Pravarasena II of whom we have inscriptions. His charters were issued from, a) the Rāmagiri (Māṇḍhal. Plates of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, Year 2), or b) Pr̥thivīsamudra (Māhurjharī Plates of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, Year 17), which is unidentified, but may have been a new residence of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, or c) the Beṇṇātaṭasthāna (Māṇḍhal. Charter of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, Year 10), but nowhere does this king names Padmapura. 33 The Beṇṇātaṭasthāna, called a vaijayika dharmasthāna, was a place on the banks of the Wainganga, probably not far from Mandhal, and this Dharmasthāna may have been the same as the one reported by Rudrasena in his Deotek inscription. 34 Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II was, like Rudrasena II, a Bhāgavata. 

29 Two charters of Pravarasena were issued from military camps (vāsaka), Tripurīvāsaka (Indore Plates of Pravarasena II, Year 23), and Hiraṇyānadīvāsaka (Wadgāon Plates of Pravarasena II, Year 25). One, the Tiroḍī Plates of Pravarasena II, was issued from what most likely was a holy place: Narattaṅgavāristhāna (CII V, 49 f.). Pravarasena may have made an offering for the salvation of his mother Prabhāvatī at this tīrtha. I take the fact that only the ‘increase of merit of mother’ (mātr̥puṇyopacayārtham, CII V, 50 l. 16) is mentioned, not that of his father, not as an indication that she was still alive, as does Mirashi in CII V, 49, but, on the contrary, as an indication that she might have recently passed away (c. ad 444). This interpretation is suggested not only by the name, which connects the (holy) place with water, but especially by the day on which the grant was made: the twelfth of the dark fortnight of the month Māgha, i.e. S. aṭtilādvādaśī, a day particularly suitable for a sesame and piṇḍa offering to the ancestors (Kane V, 434). In the same 23rd year of his reign, Pravarasena II had invaded Gupta territory, as we know from the charter that was issued from the military camp at Tripurī, and it is unlikely that he had done so when his mother was still alive (cf. Bakker 1997, 25). 

30 Shastri 1997, 6–9. 

31 For the earliest Sanskrit copperplates, which belong to the second half of the 4th century, see Salomon 1998, 114. To the evidence mentioned there should be added the Copper Plate Hoard from Bagh: Ramesh & Tewari 1990. The oldest inscription in this hoard dates from year 47, presumably Gupta Era, i.e. ad 367. The oldest known copperplate grant is the Pātagaṇḍigūḍem Copper Plate of the Ikṣvāku king Ehavala Cāntamūla (late 3rd century ad), for which see Falk 1999–2000, 275 ff. Use and spread of copperplate charters under Gupta rule is discussed by Willis 2009, 81 f. The Vākāṭaka copperplate grant of Vindhyaśakti II (Year 37) of the Vatsagulma Branch (CII V, 93–100), might be slightly earlier than, or contemporaneous with Rudrasena’s Mandhal Plates, i.e. c. ad 400.

34 See above, p. 323. The exact meaning of the terms dharmasthāna and vaijayikadharma sthāna stands in need of further investigatioṇAccording to Sircar’s Indian Epigraphical Glossary ṣv. it means ‘temple’, ‘a holy place’. Mirashi CII V, 4 translates ‘place of religious worship’. Shastri 1997, 4 f. argues that the term ‘was never used in ancient 







On account of the above considerations it is our best guess to ascribe the unfinished Mohallā Plate to the same Rudrasena II who issued the Mandhal Plates, Year 5. However, instead of mentioning Padmapura as the place of issue, as one might have expected on the basis of this hypothesis, these Mandhal Plates specify the god ‘Mondasvāmin’ as the issuing agency. Yet, there is archaeological and historical evidence that makes it plausible that this authority relates to a Viṣṇu temple in the Mandhal area, that is, arguably, in the vicinity of Padmapura, as we will see below. 

Muṇḍasvāmin 

In his Mandhal Plates Rudrasena II styled himself as someone ‘whose rule is based on the cakra, the emblem of the Bhagavat’, 35 i.e. Viṣṇu; in other words, just like his father-in-law Candragupta, Rudrasena professed to be a bhāgavata. The Vākāṭaka kings before and after him, with the exception of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, were all devotees of Maheśvara (Siva), i.e. they were Māheśvaras, so it ´ seems that his conversion to Bhagavatism had been part of an antenuptial contract. And there is more in this inscription, which may be dated to c. ad 400, that links up with Candragupta, who, at about this time, was engaged in his grand Udayagiri project. The opening of the Mandhal inscription runs as follows: 

Success! Approved. By order of Lord Muṇḍasvāmin, God of gods, who holds the conch, discus and sword; after He had made the Nāga king stretch out on the waters of the ocean, He has entered a state of yogic sleep, while lying on the serpent coils of that (king) Ananta (the Infinite One)—a bundle of expanded hoods bending (over Him by way of canopy). 36 

times in the sense of a temple or place of worship’; it refers to a ‘court of justice’, whereas vaijayika (victorious) is to be taken as ‘an honorific’. The location of Padmapura, like that of the Victorious Dharmasthāna, is unknown (cf. above, n. 65 on p. 141). A plausible conjecture, however, identifies the town with the ancient Sātavāhana site of Paunī in the Bhandara District on the right bank of the Wainganga; Paunī ← Prakit paümiṇī, Skt. Padminī(pura). 

35 Shastri & Gupta 1985, 227 l. 11: bhagavataś cakralakṣmapratiṣṭhitaśāsanasya. This ex pression is changed in the inscriptions of Rudrasena’s son Pravarasena into: ‘whose royal fortune was obtained by the grace of Cakrapāṇi, the Lord’: bhagavataś cakrapāṇeh¸ prasādopārjitaśrīsamudayasya (CII V, 12 ll. 13–14)—not merely because, as Shastri ob serves, this is ‘grammatically more acceptable’, but also because Pravarasena, who had again embraced the Saiva faith of his ancestors, thought it politically more acceptable; ´ for as a Māheśvara he could not officially declare that the rule of his father, or of his House for that matter, was based (pratiṣṭhita) on Viṣṇu’s cakra. For similar reasons Rudrasena II may have left out the religious affiliation of his father.

The reading of the first lines of the first plate are difficult due to severe damage. The editors Shastri & Gupta read in the middle of line 2: mondasvāminas◦; in the published photograph of Plate 1, I can read ◦svāminas◦, but the reading ‘monda’ is impossible to confirm. The word monda gives apparently little sense. Dental and cerebral nd are identical but for their top part, in which the square head-mark is replaced by two short curved strokes. Assuming that the reading moṇḍa is correct, we could think of Prakrit influence by which ˇo replaced u before a double consonant without much change of pronuncation. 37 If moṇḍa is not the correct reading—the upper and lower part of the akṣara are illegible—one could think of reading mau instead of mo, the difference between mo and mau being only that the right top stroke is making an upward curve rather than being a horizontal curve. Or, more likely perhaps mu, in which the straight stroke down forming the short syllable u has become erased. I tentatively conjecture the reading muṇḍasvāminas◦, but mo(au)ṇḍasvāminas◦ cannot be excluded either. 

The image described is that of the great Nārāyaṇa relief in Udayagiri. But who is this Monda- or Muṇḍasvāmin who gave the instruction (saṁdeśa)? Cer tainly this refers to Viṣṇu–Nārāyaṇa, but it remains unclear whether it signifies a local deity (i.e. image) installed in a temple in Mandhal or Padmapura. The editors of the inscription do not come forward with a satisfactory explanation of this name. 38 I would like to suggest that the first part of the name muṇḍa refers to an eponymous person who envisaged and installed this manifestation of the Bhagavat. 

As Isaacson and I have shown elsewhere, the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple In scription on the Rāmagiri mentions the princess that was wedded to Rudrasena by the name of ‘Muṇḍā’—‘a younger daughter who resembled the lustre of the moon’, 39 the same lady who, from her own inscriptions, came to be known as the ‘Lustrous One’, Prabhāvatī. This queen may have used the name Muṇḍā as long as her husband was still alive and may then have changed it into the dynastic ‘Prabhāvatī Guptā’, after she had assumed power in Vidarbha as the regentess of her minor sons in about ad 405. 40 Muṇḍa- or Moṇḍasvāmin, and even Mauṇḍasvāmin may thus be taken to mean ‘Lord of Muṇḍā’, ‘Muṇḍā’s

38 Shastri & Gupta 1997, 149 propose to connect it with a toponym by pointing to two present-day villages in the neighbourhood called Maudā and ḍo˙ngar Maudā. It seems more likely, however, that the toponyms preserve the ancient name of the temple than that the temple-name derived from these toponyms. 

39 Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription (KNT) v. 7: yhavīyaisī candra(ma)sah¸ (p)ra- (bh)hevai hyāi muṇḍanāmnī tana(yā). Bakker 1997, 164; cf. Bakker & Isaacson 1993, 53 (above, p. 123). 

40 Bakker & Isaacson 1993, 53; Bakker 1997, 16. The KNT inscription may hint at the dynastic name, when it compares the girl Muṇḍā with the light (prabhā) of the moon (candra): Prabhāvatī is ‘the one who possesses the lustre’, sciḷof Candra, her father. Tedesco 1945 proposes to derive MI muṇḍa from Skṭvr̥ddha. This is not taken over by Mayrhofer EWA ṣv., who gives as first meaning: ‘kahl’ (‘– Unklar’). 

As an appellation of a princess, the name ‘muṇḍā’ (‘the bald one’) is odd. One may 









Lord’, that is the ‘God of Prabhāvatī’. As far as I am aware, this would be the first attestation of the practice to name the installed deity after a founder who was still alive (svanāmnā). 41 

The aim of Rudrasena’s Mandhal inscription is not the installation of this deity, but rather the donation by the king of four villages in the eastern di vision of Padmapura District to a pair of settlements (adhivāsadvaya) of the Sātvata caraṇa (branch/school), which came from Vatsagulma, the capital of the Western Vākāṭakas. 42 This is the earliest attestation of royal support of a Bhāgavata organisation named Sātvata, a religious sect known, for in 

conjecture that the name refers to the tribal background of the princess, the Muṇḍas, in which case these Muṇḍas must have been part of the Nāga confederation mentioned in Prabhāvatī’s inscriptions; the Muṇḍas are known, for instance, from MBh 3.48.21 (present at Yudhiṣṭhira’s consecration), MBh 6.52.9b (App.), MBh 7.95.20 and VāP 45.123. Cf. Muruṇḍa-devī/svāminī, mother of the Uccakalpa king Sarvanātha (CII III ´ (1888), 127, 131), a queen obviously named after the Muruṇḍa people from which she came; this people is mentioned among the ‘foreign countries’ in Samudragupta’s Alla habad Pillar Inscription (CII III (1888), 8). We possess no epigraphical corroboration of the existence of the Muṇḍas, however. 

Another explanation for the name Muṇḍā could be: the girl was bald (muṇḍa), i.e. suffered from alopecia. Her bald head may have resembled the lustre of the full mooṇLüders 1961 classified the name Muṇḍa (Prakrit: Muḍa), which is found as the name of a donor on a railing at Bharhut (A 102 (827)), in the category of ‘names derived from the appearance of the body’ (CII II.2 (1998), pp. 53, 6). That the name Muṇḍa could be a brahmin name (Prabhāvatī belonged to the Dhāraṇa gotra) is proven by the Grant of Svāmidāsa, Year 67 in the copper-plate hoard from Bagh, which has preserved the name of a donee, Muṇḍa, a brahmin belonging to the Sān ´ . ḍilya gotra (Ramesh & Tewari 1990, 65). 

41 Cf. the Prabhāvatisvāmin mentioned in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription v. 21, installed after the same queen’s death for the sake of merit transfer. Bakker & Isaacson 1993, 54, 69 (above, p. 124); Bakker 1997, 30, 140–42. The shortening of the feminine suffixes ā and ī to a and i is permitted by P. 6.3.36. This naming practice created a legal fiction, individualizing the god so that he could be endowed with property and authority (cf. Sanderson 2003–04, n. 250). For naming deities after the donors see also Willis 2009, 139. The two liṅgas (?) Upamiteśvara and Kapileśvara mentioned on the Mathura Pilaster (ad 380) were named after the deceased ācāryas Upamita and Kapila (CII III (1981), 240); below, p. 494.

stance, from Mahābhārata 12.332.13–18 and the Tusām Rock Inscription.43 The Sātvatas worshipped Vāsudeva and the four other members of the Vr̥ṣṇi clan; they originated from western India. 44 The invocation of the god of his wife strongly suggests that Rudrasena was acting on her behalf: the queen hid ing herself behind the god Mu(o/au)ṇḍasvāmin at whose command the grant was made. The heuristic principle cherchez la femme has again proven its value. 

The Mandhal inscription thus seems to prove that the Vākāṭaka queen (n´ee Gupta) followed in her father’s footsteps by favouring religious organisations and building temples. She may have been the major source of inspiration of her husband and have brought the Sātvata ritual experts from Vatsagulma to the Padmapura District in order to serve in her new temple. 

Archaeological excavations in Mandhal have brought to light three temples, the most prominent of which stood on top of a hillock named Boṁgī Huḍkī (BHK II); this temple was built on a massive platform (11.70 × 14.70 m), with a garbhagr̥ha and maṇḍapa. The platform was partly built into the surface of the rock, which was levelled by 32 layers of brick at the southern side. 45 At the foot of this hillock excavations revealed another building (BHK I); under neath its brick floor a dozen of Hindu sculptures were found, among which two or three images of the Sātvata deities: Vāsudeva, Saṁkarṣaṇa, and (pos sibly) Sāmba (Aditya). ¯ 46 Whether or not this Vāsudeva image represented the Muṇḍasvāmin is impossible to say. The fact that, next to these three Vaiṣṇava images, five stylistically very similar images of markedly Saiva nature were dis- ´ covered, 47 testifies to the apparently harmonious way by which the Bhāgavatas and Māheśvaras existed side by side, tapping the same royal source of subsis tence. 

Ramagiri ¯ 

Rudrasena died young. His sudden death may account for the fact that the Mohallā Plate remained unfinished. His Gupta queen assumed power, officially as regentess of her minor sons. Her Poona Plates, dated in the 13th year of the yuvarāja Divākarasena, i.e. around ad 418, show that momentous decisions had been taken since the Mandhal foundations. 48 The dowager queen had her residence moved northwards, to Nandivardhana at the foot of the Rāmagiri, which hill she was developing into a state sanctuary that could match her father’s Udayagiri. Again a hilltop was chosen; two minor caves were excavated

on its slope, but the main Bhāgavata sanctuaries were stone temples on the top, five of which survive till today. 

The Poona Plates convey the impression that Prabhāvatī was personally in volved in promoting the cause of the Bhāgavata religioṇThe charter was issued on the 12th of the bright half of Kārttika, after breaking the fast of Prabodhinī Ekādaśī, Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa’s awakening from his cosmic sleep (earlier referred to in Rudrasena’s Mandhal Plates). This festival of cosmogonic re-awakening had an important political dimension, as has been shown by Michael Willis in the case of Candragupta and Udayagiri, 49 a case that must have been very well known to the queeṇStyling herself as entirely devoted to the Bhagavat (atyantabhagavadbhaktā), at this occasion she bestowed land upon another bha gavadbhakta, the ācārya Canālasvāmin, who may have been one of the priests employed in the waking rite and who may have been the queen’s own teacher. 50 The grant was first ritually offered (nivedya) to the bhagavadpādamūla, the feet of the Lord. As we learn from Prabhāvatī’s R. iddhapur Plates, which mention the pādamūla of the Lord of the Rāmagiri (rāmagirisvāmin), 51 this may be taken to refer to the main sanctuary on top of the Rāmagiri. 52 The paral lel with Udayagiri can even be extended further, since the oldest image that survives on the hill is that of the Boar, Varāha, lifting the world (Bhūdevī) on his tusk out of the cosmic ocean (Plate 11). That the idea was taken over but not slavishly copied, appears from the fact that the Rāmagiri Varāha is theriomorphic instead of half man half boar. 53 

At Nagardhan and environs, the area identified with Prabhāvatī’s residence Nandivardhana, (fragmentary) images have been found of Viṣṇu, but also of Gaṇeśa and the goddess Mahiṣāsuramardinī, whereas the discovery of a hoard of three splendid Buddhist bronzes along with three prabhāvalis, a parasol, a bell and an incense-burner at Hamlapuri, a village near Nagardhan, testifies to the presence of the Buddhist Saṅgha close by the court of the Vākāṭaka queen. 54 Within this court Prabhāvatī’s three sons grew up, but of only the youngest of them, Pravarasena, we possess records. These show that the prince had returned to the faith of his ancestors, since he called himself entirely devoted to Maheśvara. 55

52 Sircar has pointed out (SI I, 512 n. 2) that pādamūla, literally meaning ‘sole of the foot’, is frequently used in inscriptions as a metaphor of a deity in a temple to whom respect is paid. This deity may have been represented by an image (iconic), not necessarily by his (aniconic) footprints. Cf. Bakker 1997, 136 f.

15 / Royal Patronage and Religious Tolerance 331 Mansar 

For several years Bhāgavatas and Māheśvaras were living together in the Nandi vardhana residence, but somewhere between the eleventh and sixteenth years in the reign of Pravarasena, the latter had decided that he should construct his own residence, Pravarapura, and his own state sanctuary, Pravareśvara, both named after the king himself. 56 For these two building projects wonderful sites were found, which mirrored, as it were, the old residence and the Rāmagiri: The Pravareśvara complex was erected five kilometers to the west, on a hill again (Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī), facing the Rāmagiri, whereas at its foot the residence Pravarapura arose. Excavations at these two sites near the village of Mansar (MNS 3 and 2) during the last ten years have brought to light a wealth of material, which has been the subject of a symposium in the British Museum in 2008. 57

The personal seals—both, of Pravarasena and Prabhāvatī—found in MNS 2 (Plates 49 & 50), 58 suggest that the Vākāṭaka king stayed close to his mother and that she, at an advanced age, remained a powerful figure behind the scenes, also in the new palace of her youngest son, which was her third and last res idence since she had left the Gupta court of her youth—Padmapura, Nandi vardhana, Pravarapura. 59 When the Gupta-Nāga princess, the queen mother of the Vākāṭakas, eventually died in her early seventies in c. ad 444, a funeral monument (eḍūka) was erected, as I have argued elsewhere, at a location in between the Rāmagiri and Pravarapura, a monument that was appropriately guarded by a Nāga. 60 

In the present context it may suffice to evaluate the recent discoveries at Mansar in as far as they throw light on the theme of this essay, royal patronage, religious tolerance, and the formation of Gupta-Vākāṭaka culture. 

The magnificent state sanctuary (devakulasthāna) Pravareśvara, erected on the Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī near the village of Mansar (MNS 3), served as the place where the ceremony of issuing royal charters was performed, as attested by the Pāṇḍurṇā Plates of Pravarasena II, Year 29 (ad 441). 61 A generous land donation was granted to a group of Vājasaneya brahmins, and the same in scription records that one of the donees (Somārya) received some more land later, after a ceremonial offering of sesamum (tilavācanaka), i.e. a śrāddha rit ual, had been performed in that same Dharmasthāna. 62 The king’s largesse towards his subjects was immortalized in the benign smile of the main Siva ´ image of this temple (Plate 113), the god who bestowed life on his devotees by extending a right hand filled with flowers to them, in a gesture of benevolence (varadamudrā). 63 

58 For these seals see Kropman 2008 on http://irṣub.rug.nl/dbi/4ccec5f085aa0. 59 The last land-grant by the queen mother was made in the 20th regnal year of her son Pravarasena, c. ad 442. Shastri & Kawadkar 2001; see also http://siddhaṁuk/object/ OB00172. In the seal of these Miregāon Plates of Prabhāvatī Guptā, year 20 Prabhāvatī calls herself the ‘mother of two powerful kings’:

Within the charter these two kings are specified by name: vākāṭakānām mahārāja- śrīdāmodarasenapravarasenajananī. This charter was issued from Vainyāpurasthāna, probably a ceremonial place in a town (pura) on the banks of the Wainganga. Shastri & Kawadkar 2001, 143 think it might be the same as Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II’s Beṇṇātaṭasthāna, the Sthāna on the banks of the Beṇṇā or Vainyā River, which again may be the same as the Dharmasthāna erected by Rudrasena II (see above, p. 325) in or near Padmapura on the Wainganga. Did Prabhāvatī go back to the place where she, as newlywed queen, stayed with her husband Rudrasena for a donative function?

Conclusion 

In the four decades following Candragupta’s inauguration of his Udayagiri mon ument at the turn of the 5th century, (1) his daughter (Muṇḍā/Prabhāvatī) founded a sanctuary, dedicated to Muṇḍasvāmin, in Mandhal, probably on the Boṁgī Huḍkī, whereafter the dowager queen began the building of a series of sanctuaries on the Rāmagiri among which the state sanctuary of Rāmagiri svāmin, and (2) his grandson Pravarasena II erected his own state sanctuary Pravareśvara, on a hilltop near the village of Mansar. Yet, as is the case in the Gupta kingdom, we have hardly any charters of foundation regarding these royal sanctuaries by these monarchs themselves. 64 

Nevertheless it is fair to say that the policy of religious patronage initiated by Candragupta and his court was vigorously followed by the rulers in the East ern Vākāṭaka kingdom. The following facts bear witness to it: 1) sanctuaries bore the names of their royal founders, Muṇḍasvāmin and Pravareśvara; 2) they were alternatively dedicated to either the Bhagavat or Maheśvara; 3) they served as hallowed places for making large donations to various religious group ings (Sātvatas and Vājasaneyins), mostly in the form of land grants. 65 And later, a similar policy was practised by the Dharmamahārājas of the West ern Vākāṭaka branch in Vatsagulma, in whose kingdom we find the famous Buddhist cave monuments of Ajanta. However, here too we witness the same curious phenomenon: a lack of charters of foundation issued by the reigning king Hariṣeṇa himself. 

Although the kings showed clearly their religious orientation, we have no evidence whatsoever that could point to great enmity between the religious organisations, despite the fact that rivalry for patronage as well as clients no doubt played a role. The first four decades of the fifth century, dominated by the rule of Candra- and Kumāragupta in the north and Prabhāvatī Guptā and Pravarasena in the south, may be counted among the most stable and peaceful periods in ancient Indian history. It is this stability established by good policy and tolerance that created the conditions for an unprecedented development of the imagination, reflected in the literary and visual arts, achieving a perfection that still impresses today. 

The iconographic programme developed on the Udayagiri mountain was only partly taken over in the Vākāṭaka kingdom: images of Viṣṇu, Varāha, Narasiṁha, Gaṇeśa, and Mahiṣāsuramardinī are found at both locations, all nearly in the classical form that would remain normative for the centuries to 

64 We possess a deed of foundation of Skandagupta, viz. his Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscrip tion, in which the Gupta king records his installation of the deity Kumārasvāmin (see Bakker 2005, 249; below, p. 375; cf. Willis 2009, 144 ff.). And we possess a document of Prabhāvatī’s daughter Atibhāvatī (name uncertain), viz. the Kevala–Narasiṁha Tem ple Inscription, which records the installation of Prabhāvatisvāmin (Isaacson & Bakker 1993, 54; Bakker 1997, 30–33; above, p. 124; below, p. 354).

come. However, in Vidarbha this sophisticated artistic tradition blended with a local form of craftsmanship which lent to it its peculiar, somewhat rustic flavour and which gave rise to creative experiments that were not all equally successful. The sculptures found in Mandhal are a good example of this. But in the course of a few years since the Mandhal inception, the classical images on the Rāmagiri of Varāha, Trivikrama, and Narasiṁha were created in the ma ture Vākāṭaka idiom, which matched their Udayagiri counterparts in artistic quality and refinement. 

The workshop set up by Prabhāvatī for the production of high quality, red-sandstone sculptures continued to work under her son and reached an unequalled level of sophistication and originality in the sculptures that once adorned the Pravareśvara Temple. Although the research of these sculptures is still in its infancy and their iconography is still little understood, it may be observed that their appeal lies in their tranquility, which expresses mood and emotional state (bhāva) rather than action (vikrama), sentiment and emotion (rasa) rather than force (bala), and as such they are characteristic of the best that Indian art has produced. 







## Rāma’s Hill 

Transgression and Atonement on a Hill in the South 

and the Inadequacy of Substitutes 

Preamble 

Coming from a part of the world where there are neither holy places nor moun tains, it may seem strange that my professional career has been marked by the research of these two phenomena. Curiosity to discover unknown fields, no doubt, lies at the base of every scholarly endeavour, but in my case there may have been a more compelling factor, namely the fascination for the cultural and religious world of India. Studying the religious heritage of the Subcontinent means that one cannot miss the holy places: they are simply ubiquitous, and many of them are mountains. 1 

The symbolism of holy mountains in the Hindu tradition has been well cov ered by Laura Giuliano in her contribution to the proceedings of the conference on Religioni e Sacri Monti. As she points out, the idea of the holy mountain is interchangeable with concepts such as, for instance, ‘the world pillar’ (il pi lastro del mondo or axis mundi) and ‘the world tree’ (l’albero cosmico). 2 This symbolism is not limited to mountains as such, as Giuliano demonstrates, but underlies the very idea of the Hindu temple and its architecture. 

Rather than repeating what has been competently put forward, I would like to concentrate here on a single holy mountain, the Rāmagiri or Rāma’s Hill, right in the heart of India, in the region known as Vidarbha (47 km north of Nagpur in eastern Maharashtra). As we will see, the nexus of ideas pointed out by Giuliano will gain relevance, when we fix our attention on the significance that this hill had, and still has for the pilgrim who visits it today. This pilgrim will, no doubt, think of the classical Sanskrit epic, which has contributed so much to the Indian culture through the ages, the Rāmāyaṇa and its main hero, Rāma, son of Daśaratha, king of Ayodhyā.

The Saivala Mountain of the R ´ am¯ ayan ¯ .a 

In the seventh and last book of the Rāmāyaṇa, after Rāma had been crowned king in Ayodhyā and a period of golden rule, referred to as the Rāmarājya, had been ushered in, a nasty incident occurred, which could have been meant to remind the reader of the Rāmāyaṇa of the fact that the golden age was nearing its end. Bad behaviour, which would become endemic in our own Kali Age, was already occasionally practised in the Dvāparayuga and forbodings thereof appeared in the Tretāyuga, thus posing a threat to the universal happiness that characterized Rāma’s rule. 

A brahmin arrived at the palace gate in Ayodhyā and loudly bewailed the fate of his only son, who had died before having come of age. As the brahmin himself was absolutely blameless, this stroke of misfortune must have been caused by some other mean creature who had abused the dharma (Rām. 7.64). The possible cause of this tragic event was revealed to Rāma by his counsellor, the seer Nārada. Could it be that somewhere in his realm a śūdra might have had the nerve to practise asceticism, thereby setting a trend that was only permissible in the Kaliyuga (Rām. 7.65)? The righteous king ordered the preservation of the boy’s body by having it laid in oil, a method that worked so well in the case of his own father, and called for his celestial chariot, the Puṣpaka. The following reconnaissance flight affirmed that the dharma reigned supreme in the west, north and east of his kingdom, but in the south, the region associated with death, on the slope of the Saivala mountain, which the ´ Rāmāyaṇa situated to the south of the Vindhyas, 3 at the border of a lake, 4 something questionable seemed to be going on. 5 

An ascetic was hanging upside down, a form of severe tapas that was evi dently not customary in the golden age of the Tretāyuga, since those entitled to practise austerities did not need such extreme mortifications to attain their aims. The Puṣpaka landed and Rāma questioned the hanging man, asking whether he was by any chance a śūdra. The honest ascetic frankly admitted his humble descent, saying that he had been taken to this severe asceticism by the wish to reach the status of a god. While he was still speaking with his head hanging down—‘know that I am a śūdra, O Rāma, named Sambūka’ ´ 6— the righteous king drew his sword and chopped off his head (Rām. 7.67.3–4). Rāma was praised by the gods for having prevented a śūdra from reaching heaven and a rain of celestial flowers fell down at the spot. 7 Pleased that the

danger of having to accept a śūdra in their midst had been warded off, the gods granted that the dead brahmin boy was restored to life on Rāma’s request. Thereupon Rāma accepted the invitation of the gods to visit the hermitage of Agastya, which, as the text suggests, was thought to be somewhere in the neighbourhood, south of the Vindhya mountains. 8 It was his second visit to the āśrama; previously, during the period of exile, Rāma had been there in the company of his wife Sītā and younger brother; Agastya had then pointed out their way to Pañcavaṭī (Rām. 3.12.13). 

In earlier publications I have repeatedly tried to demonstrate the futility of the attempts by the Archaeological Survey of India to plot the epic geo graphy of the Rāmāyaṇa on the historical map of South Asia. 9 The problem is comparable to tracing the itinerary of Ulysses in the Mediterranian basiṇThough much has been written since to prove that I was wrong, especially with regard to the location of Ayodhyā and Rāma’s Birthplace (Rāmajanmabhūmi) in connection with the dispute over the Babri Masjid (Plate 4), 10 I have not come across valid arguments that have made me give up my view. 

In my opinion, therefore, the question is not where exactly the hill was on which Sambūka was beheaded, or where this hermitage of Agastya was, but the ´ scholar should ask where and when traditions emerged that identified specific topographic sites with localities of the Rāmāyaṇa. Or to put it differently, when and where did sacred places emerge that derived their fame and holiness from their believed connection with places mentioned in the Rāmāyaṇa. 

In the case of Agastya’s āśrama Dey in his Geographical Dictionary (ṣv.) enumerates eight such traditions and in the case of the Saivala mountain this ´ author refers to ‘Rˆamagiri or Rˆamtek mountain’ (Plate 51), 47 km north of Nagpur, the evidence for which we shall discuss. 

The Ramagiri ¯ 

We possess a testimony from the 13th century, not yet known to Dey, which records a local tradition that associates a particular site on Ramtek Hill with this episode of Sambūka’s penance. The ´ Ramtek Stone Inscription of the Time 

8 Rām. 3.10.80-84; Rām. 7.67.5 (1127*). The region between the Vindhya and the Saivala ´ had become deserted after the fall of King Daṇḍa, youngest of the hundred sons of Ikṣvāku, and had become known as Daṇḍakāraṇya (Rām. 7.72.17–18; cf. Rām. 7.70.16– 17). In this region the king of Vidarbha, Sveta, is said to have practised asceticism (Rām. ´ 7.70.2–3). The hermitage of Agastya is said to have been in the centre of this wilderness situated at a lake, and here Agastya’s meeting with the former king of Vidarbha, Sveta, ´ took place (Rām. 7.68.1–7). The āśrama of Agastya, the Rāmāyaṇa suggests, replaced the hermitage known as Janasthāna, which was earlier deserted at the end of Daṇḍa’s reign (Rām. 7.72.17–18).

of Rāmacandra found in the Lakṣmaṇa Temple (Plates 12 and 53) on top of this hill tells us in verse 86: 

Here the śūdra saint (muni) Sambuka had reached the abode of Murāri after ´ having been killed by the sword Candrahāsā which was wielded by Rāmacandra; and on this eminent mountain he became well-known as Dhūmrākṣa, the ‘smoke eyed one’. 11 

The sanctuary of Dhūmrākṣa is still pointed out today (Plate 52).

The same tīrtha is also described in a (late) text called Sindūragirimāhā tmya (13.9–16, 48–52, 14.1–65). 12 In this Māhātmya the śūdra is described as a bhūmipālaka (op. cit. 13.10) and an explanation is given for his name 

11 Bakker 1989b, 493; above, p. 102. The inscription, as far as legible, does not mention the name Saivala. ´ 

12 For this text, of which a longer recension also seems to have existed, see Bakker 1990b, 76; above, n. 28 on p. 90. Mirashi and Kulkarni (1939–40) refer to this longer recension in EI XXV, 11 n. 7: 

The larger Sindūragirimāhātmya mentions Mahāśaivala as a name of the hill at Rāmṭēk in addition to the two names noticed above, and explains it as being due to Siva bringing the ´ Saivas to the hill. According to the colophon the Māhātmya has ´ been taken from the Kaumārakhaṇḍa of the Padmapurāṇa; but the portion dealing with Sambūka’s story seems to have been copied ´ verbatim from the Rāmāyaṇa of

dhūmrākṣa, which says that while hanging above a firepit (kuṇḍa) he was throw ing therein leaves of bilva, drinking the smoke through his eyes (op. cit. 13.13). Rāma, after cutting off his head, allowed him to stay on the mountain in the form of a liṅga known as dhūmrapaśiva (op. cit. 14.53). Today this liṅga is referred to as Dhūmreśvara. 

  



Plate 53 

The Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa Temples on Rāma’s Hill 

Evidently the Rāmagiri tradition as reported in the Yādava inscription iden tified the śūdra who was beheaded by Rāma with a local deity Dhūmrākṣa. 13 We note also that this tradition had mitigated the most cynical part of the Rāmāyaṇa legend by allowing Sambuka/ ´ Sambūka at least to reach heaven, ´ the abode of Murāri, i.e. Viṣṇu. 14 The same Yādava inscription testifies to Agastya’s association with the hill, though the exact relation remains obscure 

Vālmīki. We have not been able to trace the Kaumārakhaṇḍa in the printed edition of the Purāṇa. Yet, this description lends support to our inference that Saivala was ´ one of the old names of the hill at Rāmṭēk. 

13 This name is also known from the epics, namely as that of a courtier of Rāvaṇa. MBh 3.270.5; Rām. 5.5.21. 

14 The Sindūragirimāhātmya 14.5–8 further mitigates Rāma’s role, since the beheading of the śūdra is said to have taken place only after the latter had attacked and slain (hata) Hanumat, who had accompanied Rāma. 









due to the fact that damage has made parts of the inscription illegible. 15 Fi nally the epigraph records the tradition that the mountain had been ‘touched by the lotus-feet of the illustrious Rāma’ (v. 83), due to which it is called ‘Rāma’s Hill’. 16 As we shall argue below, this local tradition that connected the hill with events in the life of the hero of the Rāmāyaṇa probably existed already at the beginning of the 5th century. 

The epigraphical evidence 

Two 5th-century Vākāṭaka inscriptions refer explicitly to a ‘Rāmagiri’ and a sanctuary thereon. 17 That this epigraphical ‘Rāmagiri’ is the hill a few kilometers to the north of the Vākāṭaka capital Nandivardhana, i.e. the present day Ramtek, the same hill on which the mentioned Yādava inscription is found, is now generally accepted by all historians dealing with the history of the Vākāṭakas. 18 In one of these 5th-century inscriptions the Vākāṭaka queen Prabhāvatī Guptā gives some additional information regarding the nature of the sanctuary on top of the hill, when she declares that her charters were issued from the ‘soles of the feet (pādamūla) of Bhagavat, the Lord of Rāmagiri’, 19 which echoes an earlier charter by her in which it is said that the grant had first been offered to the ‘soles of the feet of the Lord’. 20 

These epigraphs agree with a tradition that seems to underly the famous verses in Kālidāsa’s Meghadūta, the ‘Cloud Messenger’, written in the first half of the 5th century ad, in which a Rāmagiri is said to be the place of exile of a Yakṣa who used a cloud as postillion d’amour to bring a message to his beloved, whom he had left behind in the northern Himālaya mountains. 

A Yakṣa, who had neglected his duties, had lost his powers by his master’s curse— heavy to bear, since he had to live separated from his beloved for one year; he took up his abode in the hermitages on the Rāmagiri, where the trees (spread) a gentle shade and where the waters were hallowed by the bathing of Janaka’s daughter. 

[. . . ] 

After having embraced that lofty hill, you, (O cloud), should take leave of your dear friend, who, on his slopes, is marked by Raghupati’s footprints, venerated by mankind; every time when you and he meet, the shedding of warm (tear)drops born of long separation betrays his affection. 21

16 / Rāma’s Hill 341 

After an examination of the itinerary of the cloud as described by Kālidāsa, the great Maharashtrian scholar, V.V. Mirashi, identified the Rāmagiri of the Meghadūta with Ramtek Hill. He argued that the route that was followed by the cloud corresponds closely with the geography of Middle India and this left, in his view, only one possibility open. 22 The coherence of Mirashi’s ar guments and the apparent consistency of the evidence give his conclusions a great plausibility. 

From the combined evidence of the Vākāṭaka inscriptions on the one hand, and Kālidāsa’s poetic description on the other, we may deduce the following hypotheses regarding the situation on this hill in the first half of the 5th century: 

1 The Lord of Rāmagiri was Bhagavat, i.e. Viṣṇu, known as Rāmagirisvāmin. 2 The hill was associated with the perigrinations of Raghupati, i.e. Rāma, the hero of the Rāmāyaṇa and for that reason was called ‘Rāma’s Hill’. 3 The hill may have contained a tank or pond named Sītākuṇḍa or Jānakītīrtha. 23 

4 The hill may have contained a sanctuary where Viṣṇu–Rāma’s footprints (pada) were worshipped. 

Viṣṇupada 

Since the time Mirashi advanced his theory, many new Vākāṭaka artefacts have come to light.

23 This tank may have been referred to in the Yādava inscription under the name of Rāmatīrtha (see above, p. 92). 









I have selected two of them for discussion here. 24 

A tablet containing a pair of footprints was reportedly found in the Nagar dhan area, i.e. at the foot of Rāma’s Hill (Plate 54). 25 On account of the style compared to other findings of the same site, the tablet is probably to be dated to the Vākāṭaka period (5th century). The iconography of the tablet merits a closer examination. 

In addition to the pair of footprints, it contains the Vaiṣṇava symbols of the conch (śaṅkha) and club (gadā). From this we conclude with certainty that we are concerned with an icon representing the footprints of Viṣṇu (Viṣṇupada). 

An investigation into the early evidence of Viṣṇupada shrines has established that such shrines were preferably situated on hill- or mountaintops. And this makes sense, since it may have its origin in the idea that the three cosmic strides of Viṣṇu Trivikrama were taken along the axis mundi, represented either by the primordial hill of Vedic cosmogony or by the sacrificial post or yūpa in Vedic ritual. To this effect the Dutch scholar F.B.J Kuiper has observed: 

From a purely mythological point of   

view Viṣṇu, who by his position in 

the center must also in Vedic be 

lief have been immediately associ 

ated with the cosmic pillar (skambh´a), 

must have ascended along the pillar 

at the beginning of the year and de 

scended in the second half of it. [. . . ] 

There is clear evidence of Viṣṇu’s con 

nection with the mountains: he is 

‘dwelling’ or ‘standing’ on the moun 

tain(s) and ‘regent of the mountains’. 

[. . . ] he stands on the summit of 

the mountain (R. gveda 1.155.1). [. . . ] 

Later art represents him standing on 

Mount Mandara, and arising from it 

as the cosmic pillar. In the middle 

of the seventh century A.ḍan artist 

at Māmalapuram portrayed the god, 

while taking his three strides, as being 

the supporting pillar of the universe. 

(Kuiper 1983, 49) 

Plate 55 

Viṣṇu Trivikrama, Rāmagiri 

The idea of Viṣṇu Trivikrama leaving a footprint behind on earth was eventu 

ally extended to Viṣṇu in general and to his human incarnations in particular. 

24 I have earlier dealt with these findings separately in more detail in Bakker 1991, 1993b, 1997. 

25 Cf. Bakker 1991, Plate facing p. 19. Bakker 1997, 136 f., Plate XXXI B. 







16 / Rāma’s Hill 343 

Rāmagiri appears to be an example as may be inferred from the evidence pre sented here. The Vākāṭakas’ familiarity with this cosmogonical nature of Viṣṇu is proven by a 5th-century Trivikrama image of this god which still stands on top of the hill (Plate 55). 

Returning to the iconography of the tablet, we observe that in between the two footprints an enigmatic symbol is engraved. It consists of a vertical axis to which horizontal strokes, slightly turning upwards, are attached on both sides, rounded off in the apex. In earlier publications I have suggested that this may represent a (cosmic) tree. Although the tree would fit perfectly in the symbolism described above, this view should now be given up in favour of an interpretation that sees in the object a cakra in upright position, thus com pleting the Vaiṣṇava iconography of conch, club and wheel. Viṣṇu’s footprint, referring to his three strides to separate heaven and earth along the cosmic pil lar (skambha) fits his ‘connection with the mountains’, as observed by Kuiper. The symbolism of the footprint tablet would thus be complete, if we could as sume that the tablet found at the foot of the hill reflects, in miniature format, a shrine that once crowned the hill. 

This hypothesis helps us to understand the significance of the squares within which the footprints are enclosed: they may mirror the ground plan of the open air shrine that once crowned Rāma’s Hill, the rāmagirisvāminaḥpādamūlam sanctuary, in which Prabhāvatī Guptā worshipped and from where she issued her charters: a square enclosure giving access to a square platform on which an altar containing the footprints of the Lord was installed, squared in by a low railing or wall. 26 The tradition that connected the hill with a visit of Rāma naturally saw in it the footprints of Raghupati. 

The above reasoning rests on the assumption that smaller replicas were made of the images which were enshrined in the temples on top of Rāma’s Hill in the 5th century. Replicas that may have served personal devotional purposes. They may have been for sale in the local bazars, as they generally still are today, and they may have been purchased by the pilgrim to put in his satchel for carrying home as a sacred memento. For this assumption we possess further evidence. 

Narasiṁha 

Among the most prominent remains of the fifth century are the two Narasiṁha temples on top of the hill. In one of these temples a Vākāṭaka inscription has been discovered which says that the image of Prabhāvatisvāmin had been installed by the daughter in memory of and for the transfer of merit to her deceased mother, the dowager queen Prabhāvatī Guptā. It is uncertain whether the Narasiṁha image in the temple where the inscription was found actually corresponds with the named Prabhāvatisvāmin, since the inscription may have originally belonged to another temple on the hill, for instance the

one of Trivikrama. The discussion of this possibility will be postponed; it will be investigated in Bakker 2010c, 2012, 2013b (see below, pp. 351 ff., pp. 357 ff., pp. 365 ff.). For the sake of our present argument we concentrate on the Narasiṁha image. 

This image (Plate 57) is very similar to a slightly earlier specimen which we find in the adjacent temple (Plate 58) and of which we have conjectured that it was installed by Prabhāvatī herself for her deceased husband Rudrasena II. 27 The temple is still known as Rudra–Narasiṁha. Both these temples and their impressive images thus testify to the grandeur of the Vākāṭaka royal family and its god: Bhagavat Viṣṇu. In front of them, the fifth-century pilgrim must have stood in awe, as we still do today. What is more natural than the wish to carry it home in portable format? 

At the foot of the hill, in the same area where the Viṣṇupada icon has been found, about nine small Narasiṁha images have come to light and of these we can be certain that they are miniatures of the two large Narasiṁha images preserved in the temples on top of the hill (Plate 56). The devout practice of making and distributing replicas of the main images on the Rāmagiri in the 5th century thus seems to be proven beyond reasonable doubt.

The pilgrim’s satchel 

Coming to the end of our study, we are now in the position to address that aspect of the phenomenon of pilgrimage that has been chosen by the organizers, A. Barbero & ṢPiano, as theme of the conference. 

Once they return to their home countries, pilgrims make great efforts to reproduce, either wholly or in part, the buildings and environment that they have seen. [. . . ] 

Can this phenomenon of imitation, we may ask, be demonstrated by means of samples taken from the classical Indian heritage, that is, for instance, from the material that we have surveyed? The footprint tablet is less suited to this aim, on account of its rather general nature. The Narasiṁha icon, on the other hand, may be a better index. The iconography of this type of Man-lion icon is unique enough to serve as a marker, and the Rāmagiri one is apparently the first specimen of this type. Soon, that is from the sixth century onwards, a new iconography of this avatāra of Viṣṇu became fashionable all over India, one in which the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu is lying across the knees of the Man-lion, his belly ripped open by the lion’s claws (Plates 18 and 59).

16 / Rāma’s Hill 347 

Moreover, the Vākāṭaka culture and its religious and artistic achievements rapidly sunk into oblivion after the fall of this dynasty by the end of the 5th century, and we hardly have any evidence that Rāma’s Hill retained more than local significance, until it re-emerged as a regional centre of pilgrimage in the 12th and 13th centuries, in the wake of the rise of the cult of Rāma as the supreme form of God (above, pp. 161 ff.) It is in that period, we presume, that the old 5th-century footprint shrine was replaced by the large temples of Rāma and Lakṣmana, which still stand today on the promontory of the hill. For imitations of the Narasiṁha icon we therefore have to look for 5th or 6th century specimens in the area covered by the Vākāṭaka kingdom and its neighbours (Figure 6). 

  



Figure 6 

Map of Vidarbha and surrounding countries 

I know of three specimens belonging to the early 6th-century that are clear imitations of the Rāmagiri icoṇThey are found in regions that have been in close contact with the Vākāṭaka kingdom. The first one (Plate 60) is carved in the rock at Sindursi near Bahuriband (Madhya Pradesh), c. 20 km west from Sleemanabad on highway No. 7, which connected and still connects Vidarbha with the Gangetic plain. 

The other two have been found in Garh-Dhanora (c. 140 km south of Raipur) in the Bastar District of neighbouring Chhattisgarh, 28 an archaeological site identified with the ancient capital Puṣkarī of the Nalas, whose expanding king dom contributed to the collapse of the Vākāṭaka kingdom at the end of the

5th century (Plate 61). 29 In Chhattisgarh this type of Narasiṁha icon lived on still a little longer as is shown by a 7th-century specimen from Sirpur that has very recently been found (Plate 62).

Especially the Sindursi image, which is found without much sacral context, may have been carved in the rock as a sort of, in the words of Barbero and Piano, ‘substitute model that evoked and reminded visitors of the distant place of worship’, viz. the Rāmagiri in Vidarbha. 

Conclusion 

We briefly return to Kālidāsa’s Cloud Messenger. We shall never know whether the poet, when he introduced the anonymous Yakṣa living in exile on the Rāmagiri, was thinking of a local deity on Ramtek Hill, a predecessor of the one 









whom the 13th-century Yādava inscription called ‘Smoke Eye’, Dhūmrākṣa, and who, in that inscription, was identified with the śūdra Sambūka of the ´ Rāmāyaṇa. A feature that these two have in common, Kālidāsa’s yakṣa and the deity Dhūmrākṣa/Sambūka, is that both were punished for a transgression ´ of the law (dharma). However, what the poet knew very well, and what seems to have a special relevance in our age of virtual reality, was that ‘substitutes’ can never replace the real thing. This he expressed beautifully in a verse that the Yakṣa gave to the Cloud to convey to his beloved: 

Whenever I draw your picture on a rock in natural colours and wish to throw myself at your feet, you who are wounded by love, time and again my eyes become misted with a flood of tears: cruel fate prevents our meeting even there. 30

## A New Interpretation of Rāmagiri Evidence 

1 Trivikrama: Word and Statue∗ 

Preamble 

A long series of seminars at the Institute of Indian Studies of the University of Groningen came to its preliminary conclusion in 1993. In these seminars, in which Rob Adriaensen, Harunaga Isaacson and Hans Bakker took part, the newly discovered stone inscription in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple (KNT) on top of the Rāmagiri (Ramtek Hill) had been studied; this study resulted in the publication of the inscription with a translation and commentary (Bakker & Isaacson 1993; above, pp. 113 ff.). 

The greater part of the inscription was illegible due to severe damage, but we were and are pretty confident that what was readable was read correctly. The main problem, namely that of the interpretation of the inscription, could only partly be solved. The large gaps in the legible text left ample scope for conjecture. A modest beginning was made by presenting conjectured syllables between angular brackets, and some conjectures, of which we were less certain, were given in the footnotes and annotatioṇNevertheless it remained unre solved whether the inscription originally had contained the 34 verses edited or whether another 15 or 16 verses were missing due, to the fact that a right portion of the slab of unknown size had broken off and had been lost. Also the overall dedication of the inscription, which largely depends on the interpreta tion of its first verse, remained problematic. 

When I was working on the history of the Vākāṭakas, I decided to reedit the inscription, that is to say, to carry on with conjectural interpretatioṇSome conjectures earlier carefully regulated to the footnotes were included in the text and some new conjectural readings were proposed. This second revised edition appeared as Appendix I: The Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription (second revised edition), in Bakker 1997, pp. 163–167. Another round of discussions followed. Isaacson, for one, pointed out that some of my new conjectures were

less plausible, 1 and of others I became myself gradually more doubtful. 2 In sum, the final edition and interpretation of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple In scription is still beyond our reach. In the present contribution I would like to address the central hermeneutic question: the overall dedication and assign ment of the inscription. 

Maṅgalavāda: Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple (KNT) Inscription verse 1 The first verse of the inscription is of the nature of a maṅgala or benediction and refers to the main deity to whom the pious works listed are dedicated. It was published in 1993 as follows:

The second edition in Bakker 1997 reads as follows (changes to the 1993 edition in bold face):

1 In the Vākāṭaka conference held in Groningen in June 2002 Isaacson pointed out that my conjectural reading of verse 5b: pitur gr̥hhītāi(pra)ti(s.)i(ddha)hśakteḥi | cannot easily be reconciled with the tiny bits that we are able to read of this pāda. A conjectural reading: pitur gr̥hheṣv ai(pra)ti(s.)i(ddha)hśakteḥi | seems to do more justice to this, although one would rather expect a singular gr̥he; it invalidates a part of my historical reconstruction, according to which the ‘girl that grew up like a flame’ was taken from her parental home to grow up at the Gupta court (see Bakker 1997, 11). She was simply married off to Candragupta. 

2 For instance, the conjecture in verse 2a which reads: hrāijar(s.)isahmudraguptaḥi, which would imply that the verses 2 and 3 are concerned with the father of Candragupta, who, however, does not play a role further on in the inscriptioṇThe inscription does not contain the official dynastic genealogy, as do the copperplate charters of Prabhāvatī Guptā and her son Pravarasena. I now think it more likely that the verses 2 and 3 sing the praise of Candragupta who, as the late grandfather and father-in-law of the donor (the princess Atibhāvatī), is one of the main protagonists of the praśasti. 







17.1 / Trivikrama: Word and Statue 353 

The second edition built on the hypothesis advanced in the first edition, viz. that the deity of this verse is the Bhagavat, Viṣṇu, whose dark-blue colour resembles the rain cloud, but, more clearly than in the first edition, it makes explicit that at least one of the deeds referred to concerns the Vāmana avatāra, in which King Bali is outwitted by Trivikrama. Whether this caused the fear of the wife/wives of the demon in pāda d, or another one of Viṣṇu’s deeds, could not well be decided, as long as the meaning of pāda b remained opaque. Afterall, the inscription is found in a Narasiṁha temple and the wife of the ditija Hiraṇyakaśipu could also possibly have been intended. 3 

I would now propose a reading of the remaining lacuna that would give this verse a significant coherence (changes to the 1997 edition in bold face): 

1 hsa jai(ya)ti sajalāmbudodarāhbhai(s), [2010] (su)hrasaimitihpirasarājyahpāinahlaujāḥi | 

hbai(l)hii(ma)khasamayaidhitāṅga(śo)hbhoi, 

hditijavadhūibhayalohlaidr̥ṣṭi(dr.)hṣṭaiḥk 1 k 

The one whose colour resembles the depths of a water-laden rain 

cloud and whose vigour is (like) a sacrifical fire drinking the clarified 

butter (poured) in streams within the divine assembly; the splen 

dour of whose body is enlarged at the time of Bali’s sacrifice, and 

who is looked at by the wives of Diti’s son with gazes that tremble 

with fright, that one is victorious. (1) 

The conjectured reading divides the verse clearly into two halves: the first hemistich regards Bhagavat Viṣṇu under some of his general aspects, his dark blue colour symbolizing his bounty, just as the blue rain cloud is a boon of nature; 4 his vigour and splendour is like a flash, just as fire blazes up when ghee is poured into it. The hemistich evokes the beautiful and powerful im age of flashes/lightning against the background of dark monsoon clouds and connects Viṣṇu’s bounty with the (Vedic) sacrifice. The second half specifies one particular aspect of his, viz. his rescue of the world from the hands of the demon king, the son of Diti, Bali, by a powerful display of his cosmogonic di mension, the three strides, Trivikrama. From this hypothesis I infer that the piety listed in the inscription is integrally dedicated to Viṣṇu Trivikrama. The verse is consistent and cogently voices orthodox Bhagavatism. 

The conjectured reading ājyapa, ‘drinking clarified butter’, is well attested and may be illustrated by a passage in the Satapathabrāhman ´ . a (translation Eggeling): 

He then says 3), ‘Svˆahˆa Agnim!’ with reference to Agni’s butter-portion;—‘Svˆahˆa Agnim Pavamˆanam!’ if they determine upon (offering to) Agni, the blowing 4) ; 

3 Cf. Bakker & Isaacson 1993, 57; Bakker 1997, 30 n. 94. 

4 Cf. VDhP III, Vol. 1, 3.44.10. 









or ‘Svˆahˆa Agnim Indumantam!’ if they determine upon Agni, the drop-abounding 5) ;—‘Svˆahˆa Agnim!’—‘Svˆahˆa, the butter-drinking Agnis! May Agni graciously accept of the butter!’—this is the offering-prayer he (the Hotri) pronounces. 5 

In post-Vedic Sanskrit ājyapa is mostly used as a proper noun, but the slightly archaic attributive usage of the word in the 5th century inscription may have been intended as a show of orthodoxy. After all, the sacrificial myth at issue, Viṣṇu’s three strides (Trivikrama), is a R. gveda one, and the Vāmana myth is told in the same text (SBr 1.2.5; 1.9.3.8 ff.) that calls Agni ´ ājyapa. The reading ojas (if the conjecture is correct) also may recall the R. gveda myth: yadā te [scil. Indra] viṣṇur ojasā trīṇi padā vicakrame | (R̥V 8.12.27). The kavi who composed the praśasti (referred to in vv. 33, 34) knew his śruti. 

The above observations prompt us to speculate about the group of priests (to which also the kavi may have belonged), which performed the various rit uals that accompanied the described activity and which may have (indirectly) benefited from it. These pious acts were for the greater part performed for the exclusive benefit (merit) of the (deceased) mother, whom, as we have argued, is queen Prabhāvatī. 6 It would be natural that for this purpose the daughter employed priests (not mentioned in the readable part of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription), who had been closely connected to her mother; some of those we know from Prabhāvatī’s last charter dated in the 20th regnal year of her son Pravarasena II (c. ad 442), that is shortly before she died, when the dowager queen was about seventy years old: they were brahmins belonging to ‘the Kaśyapa gotra and the Mādhyandina śākhā of the Vājasaneyī saṁhitā of the Yajurveda’, in other words, brahmins to whose sacred text corpus the Satapathabrāhman ´ . a belonged. 7 It can therefore hardly be surprising if idiom of this corpus would show up in the inscription, as our conjecture suggests. 

The KNT Inscription verse 21 

We now turn to a portion of the inscription that describes the deeds performed for the sake of merit, which was the main object of the activity of the princess (v. 19: manujendraputrī), verses 20 ff. Being not part of the praśasti, it is in the simpler metre of the Sloka. In the second edition of 1997 verse 21 runs as ´ follows (changes to the edition of 1993 in bold face):

17.1 / Trivikrama: Word and Statue 355 

The conjectures accepted in the revised text make the references to the temple (ālaya) of Prabhāvatisvāmin and the beneficiary, viz. the mother (mātuh.) ex plicit. I now propose to read śubham in the syllables 3 and 4 of the fourth pāda of verse 21. This is metrically correct—pāda 21a being a ra-vipulā and a ra-gaṇa (a cretic: ˘ ) is avoided in the positions 2 to 4 of the even pāda 21d—and it would give us the following text (changes to the 1997 edition (above, p. 124) in bold face): 

11 prabhāvatisvāminaṁca, lokanāhthaim a(th)ā(la)hyei | [2010] puṇyam akṣayam uddiśya, (mā)htuḥśubham aikhāirayahti k 21 k 

Then (the princess) commissioned the splendid ‘Master of Prabhā 

vatī’, (the image of the) Lord of the World, within the temple, for 

the sake of undecaying merit of (her) mother. (21) 

The principal deed recorded in the inscription, the foundation of the temple (ālaya) itself, may have been duly mentioned as the first item in the list of pious acts; it may have been expressed in the illegible verse 20. The installed deity, represented by the image within this temple, is Viṣṇu Lokanātha, designated as Prabhāvatisvāmin. 

Because the inscription was found in a Narasiṁha sanctuary, we have hy pothesized that the splendid Narasiṁha image in this temple (Plate 57) repre sents Prabhāvatisvāmin. 8 However, in both editions already some doubt had been expressed regarding this identification, 9 and now, as we have reached a complete understanding of the first maṅgala verse, which unambiguously seems to refer to Trivikrama, not to Narasiṁha, this doubt has turned into a firm belief: originally the inscription did not belong to the Kevala–Narasiṁha Tem ple. 

The discovery of the KNT Inscription 

Let us re-examine the present condition of the stone inscriptioṇThe inscription was found ‘in the course of cleaning the walls of the Narsimha Temple at Ramtek . . . on the southern wall of the mandapa’ by the Central Museum, Nagpur, as reported in Indian Archaeology—A Review 1982–83, 137. The removing of the layers of plaster caused great damage to the inscriptioṇThe latter was engraved in two stone slaps, the lower one (containing lines 13 to 15) was broken in the middle. Altogether these three parts were walled up again during the restoration work by means of cement. 10 The total height of the stone is about 50 cm, the breadth about 100 cm. The ragged right sides of

10 Jamkhedkar 1992, p. 164 n. 18 notes: ‘The removal of the whitewash and the location of the inscription on the original blocks of stone showed that the wall was intact.’ 







both the upper and the lower slab indicate that some portion of the stone had earlier been broken off, a portion that was obviously not recovered during the restauration work and is to be considered as irretrievably lost. 

In other words, when the inscription originally was inserted into the southern wall of the maṇḍapa of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple it was already incom plete. 11 In an unknown state of the temple’s history, possibly the Bhonsle period (18th century), when the temple was being repaired or rebuilt, the re maining slabs of the stone inscription must have been brought to the Kevala– Narasiṁha Temple. 12 The inscribed slabs of black stone thus came from else where, possibly along with other building blocks of red sandstone, and their source may have been a similar, though ruined temple in the neighbourhood that was used as a quarry. Such a ruin does still exist on the Rāmagiri, viz. a 5th-century temple of which, apart from two maṇḍapa walls, little remains today. Only its image has miraculously survived the ages in situ, and, although it is heavily damaged, this statue conclusively proves that this ruin once was a Trivikrama Temple. 13 

From the evidence presented we infer that this Trivikrama image (Plate 55) is the one that is named ‘Prabhāvatisvāmin’. The Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription may thus originally have belonged to this, now ruined, Trivikrama Temple on the Rāmagiri. Other arguments that substantiate this inference are presented below, pp. 365 ff. (Bakker 2013b). 

11 See Bakker & Isaacson 1993, 62; above, p. 135. 

12 According to Jamkhedkar 1992, 159: 

Raghuji (Bhonsle), after establishing himself in the Nagpur region, created an agrahāra and religious endowments for the maintenance of the monuments and worship there. At least at that time some repairs must have been executed. 

In n. 15 (ibid.) this author writes: 

When Raghuji set out on his expedition of Deogarh, he had camped at Rāṁṭek. On seeing that the main temples are devoid of images, he made a vow that he would restore the images in their places if he was blessed with victory. In fact, he had got new images made at Jaipur, but ultimately consecrated old images (1753 A.D.) retrieved from the waters of the river Sur. 

If this statement were true, it is not even certain that the Narasiṁha image origi nally belonged to the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple. One wonders which and how reliable the sources are of Jamkhedkar’s above statement. The description of the temple after restoration and the first edition of the inscription were given in Jamkhedkar 1987b. In this publication (pp. 219, 222 f. nn. 17–19) Jamkhedkar describes the earlier ‘conserva tive repairs’ that were removed in the latest restoratioṇAll this conveys the impression that the KNT temple has frequently been tampered with over the centuries. 

13 See A.P. Jamkhedkar 1988, 85 f., Plates 103–09; Bakker 1997, 142–45, Plate XXXIV; above, Plate 55; below, Plates 64, 65. 








2 The Gupta–Vak¯ at¯ .aka Relationship∗ 

Preamble 

The 5th-century stone inscription preserved in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple (KNT) on top of the Rāmagiri (Ramtek) has been edited thrice: by A.P Jam khedkar in 1987b, by Bakker & Isaacson in 1993, and by Bakker 1997. 14 Its interpretation is hindered by the fact that only one third of the text is legible. Recently the present author has studied the inscription again and has proposed some new conjectural readings, which seem to clarify the overall dedication of the pious activity recorded in the inscription (Bakker 2010c; above, pp. 351 ff.). 

According to this latest reconstruction, the pious activity recorded in the in scription seems to have been dedicated to Viṣṇu Trivikrama. Consequently, it has been argued that the inscription does not originally belong to the Kevala– Narasiṁha Temple in which it is presently found, but to the adjacent ruin of the Trivikrama Temple. The surviving Trivikrama image of this ruin may represent the Prabhāvatisvāmin, the commission of which by a princess (manu jendraputrī) is recorded in the KNT inscription (v. 19, above, pp. 354 f.). 

The Praśasti. KNT Inscription verses 2–19 

In the present contribution I would like to reconsider the narratative structure of the praśasti part of the inscription, i.e. its verses 2 to 19, in order to obtain a better understanding of the royal pedigree that it proclaims. Because the right-hand portion of the slab of stone on which the inscription has been en graved is missing, it could not be determined with certainty what the original number of verses may have beeṇA conservative estimate assumes that the in scription comprised 34 verses, of which the praśasti part counted 19 (including the Maṅgala verse). This estimate is based on the assumption that there were two Upajāti verses (88 syllables) to a line, each line beginning a new verse. The present slab measures c. 50 cm in height and 100 cm in width. The conservative estimate implies that the original stone must have covered a breadth of about 170 cm. 

∗ The first version of this article was published in 2012 as the second in a series of three under the title The Gupta–Vākāṭaka Relationship. A new interpretation of Rāmagiri evidence (2). in: Religions of South Asia 5.1–2 (2011), 293–302.

However, in our first edition we did not exclude the possibility that the inscription originally had 3 Upajāti verses to a line, which would make the breadth come to approximately 250 cm—very broad indeed (above, p. 116). The reason for this speculation was the contents of the inscription, since ap parently much vital information, which we thought must have been in the original, was not found in the legible portion. 15 

Rethinking the contents and structure of the praśasti, I now think that the conservative estimate leaves enough room for providing all information that is needed to make the story told in the inscription an intelligible and meaningful unity. The praśasti does not contain the standard genealogy as do the copperplate charters of the Vākāṭakas; instead it gives an unusually detailed historical account of the extraordinary life of its patroness, the princess (manujendraputrī) mentioned in v. 19, the last verse of the praśasti, after which the record of her pious deeds begins (vv. 20–34). 

We take as our point of departure that the praśasti originally counted only one Puṣpitāgrā verse (1) and 18 Upajāti’s (2–19). For the Sanskrit text and translation see above, p. 122 ff. We may present its hard core, that is the legible information contained in the inscription, as follows (verses are grouped in pairs when the subject is surmised to be divided over two verses and we have too little information to distinguish between the individual verses). 

Verse Number Subject 

1 1 Viṣṇu Trivikrama 

2, 3 2 rājarṣi, mighty king 

4 1 

5 1 girl who grows up like a flame in father’s house 6 1 

7 1 birth of sons and youngest sister named Muṇḍā 8 1 

9 1 Candragupta . . . sutā . . . to śrī Rudrasena 

10 1 

11 1 king . . . gets son Ghaṭotkaca 

12 1

16 1 

17 1 bhrātr̥brings . . . home with force (balāt) 

18, 19 2 manujendraputrī resolves on pious activity 

Our first conjecture is that Candragupta mentioned in v. 9 is introduced in 15 Bakker & Isaacson 1993, 48; above, p. 116. 







17.2 / The Gupta–Vākāṭaka Relationship 359 

the verses 2 and 3. Either he, or possibly his father Samudragupta, 16 is the one who is called rājarṣi in v. 2. This king Candragupta II gives his daughter named Muṇḍā to Rudrasena. Our second conjecture is that the king who in v. 11 is said to get the son Ghaṭotkaca is also Candragupta and that this son Ghaṭotkaca is the subject of v. 12 and is the same as the rājarāja who is said to marry his sister’s daughter, that is his niece (bhāgineyī) in v. 13. 

These set of conjectures is based on a postulate, that is, a premise that we cannot deduce from the inscription itself, but that we need, in order to give coherent meaning to its diverse pieces of informatioṇThe postulate is that the inscription is concerned with the genealogical relationship of the Gupta and Vākāṭaka dynasties, neither of which is mentioned as such in the legible part of the inscription, and that this relationship underlies the contents of the illegible verses 4, 6, and 8. This relationship is known from other sources to be as follows. 

  



Figure 7 

Gupta Vākāṭaka relationship as known before the KNT Inscription 

Candragupta II’s daughter Prabhāvatī Guptā is married to the Vākāṭaka king Rudrasena II. Ghaṭotkaca is known as the viceroy of Vidiśā during the reign of his senior half-brother Kumāragupta. 17 We assume that this relationship underlies the illegible verses 8 and 10, that is to say that in v. 8 Rudrasena of the Vākāṭaka dynasty is introduced and that in v. 10 the birth of a son (or sons) and one daughter in the marriage of Candragupta’s sutā and Rudrasena (v. 9) is described. If this assumption is correct, it implies that the princess Muṇḍā given to Rudrasena is no one else than Prabhāvatī Guptā, of whom Muṇḍā may be the personal name (see below, p. 362). 

On account of these premises we conclude that the niece (bhāgineyī) of verse 13 is a daughter of Prabhāvatī Guptā and Rudrasena, who married her maternal 

16 In my revised edition of this inscription (Bakker 1997, 163), I conjectured to read ‘samudraguptah.’ in pāda 1 of verse 2, but I now think this is less probable (above, n. 2 on p. 352). Candragupta II may be the only subject of the verses 2 and 3. 

17 See the Tumain Inscription of Kumāragupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta, G.E. 116 (ad 435), in: Epigraphia Indica XXVI (1941–42), 118; CII III (1981), 276–79; Bakker 2006, pp. 172 ff., above, p. 309 ff. 









uncle Ghaṭotkaca. The praise of this Ghaṭotkaca is probably sung in the verses 14–15. The inscription, if thus interpreted correctly, allows us to complete the Gupta–Vākāṭaka genealogical relationship. 

  



Figure 8 

Gupta Vākāṭaka relationship as deduced from the KNT Inscription 

For the above reasoning to be correct, it is necessary to assume that the il legible verse 6 describes the wedding of Candragupta and the Nāga princess Kuberanāgā, the parents of Prabhāvatī. The ‘father’s house’ of verse 5 then presupposes that the dynastic house of the Nāga king, father of Kuberanāgā, in which she ‘grew up like a flame’, is introduced in verse 4. 

The above premises allow the inference that the ‘brother’ of verse 17 is the brother of the ‘niece’ that was married to Ghaṭotkaca, who must be the Vākāṭaka king Pravarasena II, who may have been introduced either in verse 10 or verse 16. This inference is based not only on the above premises but also on the assumption that the illegible verse 16 refers, in guarded terms maybe, to a conflict leading to the death of Ghaṭotkaca in verse 17, as the mentioning of Indra/Purandara suggests; this event turned the ‘niece’ into a widow. The fact that he brings his widowed sister home ‘with force’ (balāt, v. 17d) could be explained by assuming that Pravarasena II sided with Ghaṭotkaca against a common enemy. The manujendraputrī of v. 19 refers to this widow, daughter of Rudrasena and Prabhāvatī, who had returned to her paternal home; from verse 24d we conjecture that her name was Atibhāvatī. 18 

Conjectured narrative structure of the KNT Inscription 

The above argumentation can be summarized in the following schematic pre sentation of the contents of the praśasti of the KNT InscriptioṇThe postulated premises are given in small capitals, the conjectures derived from the legible text and based on these postulates are given in bold face.

(manujendraputrī) home with force (balāt) 

18, 19 2 manujendraputrī (Atibhāvatī) resolves on

It goes without saying that the above schematic interpretation of the inscription is a hypothesis. If, to conclude, this hypothesis is correct, there is no need to suppose that a third Upajāti verse is missing at the end of the lines. The reconstructed narrative structure would allow the conclusion that the praśasti counted 19 verses only. 

The Daughter named Muṇḍā 

A key assumption in the theory advanced above is the identity of the daughter named Muṇḍā and the dowager queen known from her own inscriptions as Prabhāvatī Guptā. This identity seems reinforced by independent evidence, viz. the Māṇḍhal Plates of Vākāṭaka Rudrasena II, Year 5, which open as follows: 

Success! Approved. By order of Lord Muṇḍasvāmin, God of gods, who holds the conch, discus and sword; after He had made the Nāga king stretch out on the waters of the ocean, He has entered a state of yogic sleep, while lying on the serpent coils of that (king) Ananta (the Infinite One)—a bundle of expanded hoods bending (over Him by way of canopy). 19 

To make sense of this opening statement, we take it that the presiding god Devadeva (Viṣṇu), on whose cakra Rudrasena’s rule is said to be based (above, 

19 Based on Shastri & Gupta 1997, 155 ll. 1–2. For Sanskrit text and discussion see Bakker 2010d; above,n. 36 on p. 326. 









p. 153, p. 326), is here designated ‘Muṇḍasvāmin’; and, in accordance with the practice of the age to prefix the names of the temple deities with the names of their founders, it follows that this deity had been installed by Muṇḍā (cf. above, n. 41 on p. 328). 

Although this is obviously the primary meaning of the opening statement, some double-entendre seems to be implied, since Muṇḍasvāmin may be taken to mean ‘the husband of Muṇḍā’, that is king Rudrasena, who is the actual author of the inscriptioṇAnd the Nāgarāja who supports him could be taken to mean a ruler of the Nāga House, the house in which his mother-in-law, Kuberanāgā, ‘grew up like a flame’. From the Māṇḍhal. Plates it thus seems to emerge that Rudrasena’s wife used her personal name Muṇḍā as long as her husband was alive. The dynastic name ‘Prabhāvatī Guptā’ was adopted when she, as a dowager queen, assumed the regency over her sons. 20 

The Gupta–Vākāṭaka relationship 

The matrimonial relations of the Gupta and Vākāṭaka dynasties can thus finally be presented as follows. 

  



Figure 9 

The Gupta Vākāṭaka relationship 

After we have thus established the contents of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription to the best of our ability, it is time to be astonished at the story it tells. 

The narration of the KNT Inscription 

First of all it needs to be noted that, despite the fact that the inscription is found in Vākāṭaka territory and celebrates foundations within the complex 

20 Bakker & Isaacson 1993, 53; Bakker 1997, 16. The KNT inscription may hint at the dynastic name, when it compares in verse 7 the girl Muṇḍā with the light (prabhā) of the moon (candra): Prabhāvatī is ‘the one who possesses the lustre’, sciḷof Candra, her father. For a discussion of this name (meaning ‘the bald one’) see above, n. 40 on p. 327. Is it coincidence that Muṇḍā’s younger brother is named the one who is ‘Bald-like-a-pot’ (Ghaṭotkaca)? 







17.2 / The Gupta–Vākāṭaka Relationship 363 

of Vākāṭaka state sanctuaries on the Rāmagiri, the document may be called ‘Gupta’ rather than ‘Vākāṭaka’. The praśasti devotes ten verses (2–3,6–7,11– 16) to the Gupta lineage against only three (8–9, 17) to the Vākāṭaka family members. Clearly the Gupta princess, n´ee Vākāṭaka, remained loyal to her in laws, also after she had returned to the Vākāṭaka kingdom. This emerges from the fact that, if our theory is correct, four or five verses deal with her deceased husband Ghaṭotkaca. And like her mother Prabhāvatī in her inscriptions, the princess Atibhāvatī does not waste words on the Vākāṭaka kings, mentioning her father Rudrasena only in passing and apparently omitting his ancestors. By contrast, however, she elaborates on her maternal lineage, the Nāgas in vv. 4 and 5, the birth of her mother in vv. 6 and 7, and her own birth and wedding in vv. 10 and 13. 

Like her mother Queen Prabhāvatī, the princess took great pride in being a descendant of Candragupta II, her maternal Gupta grandfather, who also hap pened to become her father-in-law. That the princess followed in the footsteps of her celebrated mother Prabhāvatī is also evident from another important fact revealed by the inscription: women, queens and princesses, had obviously a direct say in state affairs and had access to the financial recourses of the state, which they could apply to their own works of charity. It is unthinkable that temples, images, and a water reservoir could have been financed out of the traditional strīdhana. To have permitted such a degree of freedom to the women of their family is entirely to the credit of the Vākāṭaka kings Rudrasena II and Pravarasena II. To this freedom we owe the magnificent monuments on the Rāmagiri. 

Another astonishing fact revealed by the inscription is that marriages be tween uncle and niece (bhāgineyī) were, occasionally probably, permitted in the aristocracy, even under a brahmin king who boasted to have brought back to earth the Kr̥tayuga, the golden age, in which the dharma was supposedly uncor rupted. 21 Here we are not concerned with cross-cousin marriage that is known from the Dravidian South. This once-removed filiation served to consolidate political power and territory. In this respect the Gupta–Vākāṭaka matrimonial policy was not different from that practised within European royal courts. 22 The genealogy constructed by matrimony thus served a Machiavellian schem ing for power in 5th-century India. I have described this scheming elaborately in my Theatre of Broken Dreams (Bakker 2006; above, pp. 301 ff.). 

At the end, the inscription reports an act of violence, the forceful removal of a widow from the house of her in-laws. This implies war between the Guptas and Vākāṭakas. Obviously the political objective of this non-dharmic union had grown stale when the Gupta–Vākāṭaka relationship deteriorated. The 

21 See e.g. Pravarasena’s Jāmb Plates, in CII V, p. 12 lines 15–16. 

22 Two European examples that spring to mind are found in the House of Habsburg: Charles II of Austria’s marriage to his niece Maria Anna of Bavaria (daughter of his sister Anna of Habsburg), and Phillip II of Spain’s (fourth) marriage to his niece Anna of Austria (daughter of his sister Maria of Spain). 









death of Ghaṭotkaca probably happened in a conflict over the royal succession after Kumāragupta. Ghaṭotkaca, viceroy in Vidiśā under Kumāragupta, was prevented from succeeding his brother to the throne by the latter’s bastard son, Skandagupta. Evidently the Vākāṭaka king Pravarasena II took the side of his brother-in-law Ghaṭotkaca, and when this party lost the war of succession, he abducted his sister from the palaces of his enemy. 23 The war may have started with Pravarasena’s crossing of the Narmadā in c. ad 445, 24 and ended with the return of the widow to his capital Pravarapura/Nandivardhana. Skandagupta acceded to the Gupta throne in c. ad 455. 

It cannot be excluded that yet another motive incited Pravarasena to this unprecedented act. His sister was given in marriage to her maternal uncle by Pravarasena’s mother Prabhāvatī during the latter’s regency. It could well be that the young prince Pravarasena had never been too happy about this breach of the dharma and the subordination to the Gupta dynasty that it entailed. By bringing her back to her place of birth, King Pravarasena may have strengthened his image of a righteous king. This image was boosted further by allowing his sister to spend great sums on meritorious activity, the most significant of which may have been the building of the Trivikrama Temple and the installation of the image of Prabhāvatisvāmin in memory of their mother, Prabhāvatī Guptā. 

23 For more details see Bakker 2006. 

24 In the Indore Plates dating from Pravarasena’s twenty-third regnal year, i.e. soon after Prabhāvatī’s death, it is reported that Pravarasena II pitched his army camp (vāsaka) in Tripurī (modern Tewar) on the northern bank of the Narmadā River, i.e. in Gupta territory (Mirashi 1982a, 69, 72 l. 1; Bakker 1997, 25; above, p. 314). 







A New Interpretation of Rāmagiri Evidence 

3 The Trivikrama Temple∗ 

Preamble 

This essay is the last of a series of three. 25 In the first two sections it has been argued that the pious activity recorded in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Tem ple Inscription was actually dedicated to Viṣṇu Trivikrama, not to Narasiṁha, the deity installed in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple on top of the Rāmagiri (Ramtek) where the inscription has been found. From this and other cir cumstantial evidence it has been inferred that the KNT inscription does not originally belong to the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple, but to the adjacent ruin of the Trivikrama Temple and that Prabhāvatisvāmin, the deity named in the in scription, actually refers to the Trivikrama image preserved in this ruin (above, p. 356). The KNT Inscription may have been placed in the Narasiṁha Tem ple together with other building blocks when this temple was reconstructed in the Bhonsle period (18th century). The ruins of the Trivikrama Temple in its vicinity may have served as a quarry. In the present study I will substantiate this inference by comparing the evidence of the inscription with the material remains of the Trivikrama Temple which are still in situ. 

The Trivikrama Temple 

As shown by the Google Earth satellite picture in Plate 63, both temples, the Kevala–Narasiṁha and the Trivikrama, are situated somewhat outside the main temple complex on the spur of the hill, which may be an indication of the relative late date of these two temples. This applies in particular to the Trivikrama Temple at the edge of the hill, c. 200 m northeast of the Varāha Temple (Plate 11), which marks the entrance to the spur of the hill. 

Of the Trivikrama Temple only parts of the vestibule (maṇḍapa) are still standing (Plate 64). The main temple idol has been miraculously preserved (Plate 65), although it is heavily damaged and seems to occupy still its original position, facing west like the Varāha and Narasiṁha images.

Plate 65 

Main image of the Trivikrama Temple 

The style and ornamentation of the walls and pillars of the vestibule have been described and illustrated by Jamkhedkar 1988. A stylistic comparison with the other 5th-century remains on the hill also indicates a relatively late date of this temple. In this respect it seems relevant to refer to Joanna Williams’ Vākāṭaka Art and the Gupta Mainstream, in which she observed the following: 

The pillars [of the Trivikrama Temple] are similar and might be compared to examples from Nachna and Deogarh in the late fifth and early sixth centuries ad, although the resemblances are not very specific. The only pecularity is a flat, anchor-shaped element below the lower vase, perhaps a simplified version of the palmette which often appears in this position. (Williams 1983, 225 f.) 

This anchor-shaped element and its counterpart in Deogarh are illustrated in Plates 66 and 67.

The Trivikrama image is made of red sandstone and measures 178×119 cm. Mirashi was the first to give a description of this idol. 

The god has a crown on his head, with a halo round his face. He wears the ku ṇḍalas on his ears and a pearl-necklace with a large pendant round his neck. His vaijayantī garland is shown falling on both his legs. He wears an udarabandha. His lower garment, which is fastened at the waist with a girdle, hangs down in folds in front. His arms are now broken on both the sides, but their jewelled aṅgadas (armlets) can still be seeṇHis left foot is planted on the ground, while the right foot, which was raised to measure the sky, is now broken at the knee. (Mirashi 1963, lx) 

The deity had eight arms, all sadly broken off, which makes it impossible to say anything directly about the attributes he must have carried. He wears the double muktāyajñopavīta, of which the six strings of pearls have been almost completely erased at the front side of the image, but are still clearly visible at the back. A significant feature of the Trivikrama image of the Rāmagiri is the ‘pleated’ śiraścakra that encircles his head, the origin of which James Harle (1987) has traced to the fan-shaped tufts at the end of the band holding the crown.

Plates 68 and 69 

Relief at the bottom of the Trivikrama sculpture 

In the present context, the most significant part of the image—iconographically speaking—is the relief at the bottom of the striding Trivikrama. This relief is rather worn off, but enough remains to identify the depiction (Plates 68 and 69). Clear and relatively well-preserved is the figure of King Bali standing underneath the stretched right leg of Trivikrama (Plate 71). To the right of the Daitya king we see the outline of a smaller figure, which, I presume, represents his wife (Plate 70).

To Bali’s left, against the left leg on which Trivikrama stands, is the lower leg visible of a small figure (Plate 72). 

The iconographic programme be   

comes clear if we compare it with 

the well-known lintel from Pawaya 

(Plate 73), which depicts Bali’s sac 

rifice and Viṣṇu Trivikrama. If 

we ignore the representation of the 

sacrifice itself along with its three 

priests and the two priestly helpers 

who welcome Vāmana by pouring 

water upon his hands, this lintel 

depicts from left to right: Bali’s 

wife (seated), king Bali (his left 

arm raised), the dwarfish figure of 

Vāmana, and the (eight-armed) cos 

mic god Trivikrama. In other words, 

the positioning of the protagonists of 

the myth in the Pawaya lintel con 

forms to the one in the Trivikrama

17.3 / The Trivikrama Temple 371 

The pious works of Atibhāvatī 

Although the relief is admittedly too worn to see the frightened eyes of the Daitya’s wife, the Rāmagiri Trivikrama sculpture conforms to the depiction of the myth in the dedicatory verse of the KNT Inscription when it says of Viṣṇu: 

The splendour of whose body is enlarged at the time of Bali’s sacrifice, and who is looked at by the wives of Diti’s son (i.e. Bali) with gazes that tremble with fright, that one is victorious. (above, p. 353) 

This inscription, as we have discussed in Bakker 1997, 2006 and 2012 (above, pp. 301 ff., pp. 357 ff.), relates the life and pious deeds of Prabhāvatī Guptā’s daughter Atibhāvatī after the Eastern Vākāṭaka king Pravarasena II had brought home his widowed sister from Vidiśā. Atibhāvatī erected the Trivi krama Temple in commemoration of her deceased mother, naming the deity after her mother Prabhāvatisvāmin in order to transfer merit to her, as v. 21 of the inscription records: 

Then (the princess) commissioned the splendid ‘Master of Prabhāvatī’, (the image of the) Lord of the World, within the temple, for the sake of undecaying merit of (her) mother. 26 

And after the building of this main temple and the installation of its main image, the princess commissioned other works. The most evident among them was the building of a flood-control dam, which yielded the water reservoir Sudarśana (v. 24): 

She of extreme lustre (atibhāvatī) had a water reservoir Sudarśana made, along with the beautiful god (Sudarśana) in the village of Kadalīvāṭaka. 27 

Kadalīvāṭaka may be the modern hamlet Kelāpur, 2 km north of Rāma’s Hill and the artificial lake is, after the dam had been rebuilt in recent times, again (or still) there, known under the name of Khindsi Lake. The Trivikrama Temple towers high above this beautiful sight, Sudarśana (Plate 74). 

Conclusion 

Summarizing, it may be observed that the identification of Prabhāvatisvāmin with Viṣṇu Trivikrama and, consequently, the assignment of the Kevala–Nara siṁha Temple Inscription to the Trivikrama Temple are corroborated by: 1 The perfect match of the Ma˙ngala verse and the iconography of the Trivikrama image. 

2 The location of the Trivikrama Temple, somewhat outside the main temple area, which links this temple closely to the other work of Atibhāvatī, the artificial Sudarśana Lake. 

3 The relatively late date of the Trivikrama Temple and sculpture, which are stylistically the latest of all Vākāṭaka remains at Rāmagiri.

Trivikrama Temple on the top of the Rāmagiri (view to the north) 

As has been argued, the activity of Atibhāvatī must have taken place between the death of her husband Ghaṭotkaca Gupta (c. ad 453–54) and that of her brother Pravarasena II (c. ad 456–57). Atibhāvatī’s example was copied, when power shifted from the Eastern to the Western Vākāṭaka kings following the death of Pravarasena II. An inscription found in Hisse-Borala near Wasim of Devasena, Vākāṭaka king in Vatsagulma, dated in the year 380 of the Saka ´ Era, i.e. ad 457–58, records ‘the construction of a water storage (saras) called Sudarśana by a noble named Svāmilladeva, for the welfare of all living beings’ (Bakker 1997, 32). 

The building of the Trivikrama Temple and the installation of its deity Prabhāvatisvāmin took place before this and may thus be dated between ad 453 and 457. The Trivikrama sculpture (Plates 55 and 65) was made in those years, probably in the same workshop in which the images of the Pravareśvara Temple in Mansar (5 km to the west) were sculptured. The latter temple was the grand project of the princess’ brother, King Pravarasena II, and by this time the sculptors had exchanged the dark basalt stone, used in the earlier images of Varāha and Narasiṁha, for the red sandstone that gave the hill its other name, Sindūragiri. 28

## Skandagupta’s Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription
A Note on Skandagupta’s Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription, verses 8–12∗ 

Commemorating the Dead 

Ajay Mitra Shastri 

One of the dear memories I have of Prof Dr Ajay Mitra Shastri is the moment that the doors of the arrival hall of Amsterdam Airport opened and I saw my learned friend leaving the ‘nothing to declare’ behind him. He came as a an invited speaker of the biennial conference of the European Association of South Asian Archæologists, held in Leiden in the summer of 1999. The journey had been a safe one and evidently Ajay was much relieved when he saw a familiar person at the place of landing. A happy smile passed over his face. And I was glad that, finally, I had an opportunity to return some of the kind hospitality that had been bestowed on me every time I had come to Nagpur. Taking its start from a common interest, our relationship had developed from mutual respect to friendship. 

Ajay’s contribution to the conference, Sātavāhana-Kṣatrapa Chronology and Art-history, was a brilliant one, displaying a learning in history, numismatics and epigraphy that only few people can match. To invite my friend had proven to be an excellent idea. For myself he had a surprise in store. When I spoke of the role the archaeological site of Mansar could have played in Vākāṭaka history and had made the conjecture that the temple that the ASI had only just unearthed (MNS 3) could have been Pravareśvara, known from inscriptions, Ajay rose and informed the audience that this conjecture had been confirmed by recently found sealings, which had been brought to him from the site by the excavators for deciphering: they read that very temple’s name. 1

After the conference I had the honour and pleasure to be Ajay’s host for some more days. The weather was beautiful, we did some sight-seeing and drunk tea in our gardeṇIt was there that we discussed for the first time the idea to organize a joint conference on the Vākāṭakas. Plans were worked out in the years that followed. The conference was scheduled to take place in Groningen in June 2002. On Saturday 12 January 2002 the news reached me that Ayaj Mitra Shastri had passed away a day earlier. 2 The shock was great. Shastri’s death meant that Vidarbha had lost one of its great historians, a scholar whose work crowned the famous, learned tradition of V.V. Mirashi and V.B. Kolte. And I had lost a friend. 

As a tribute to the eminent savant I present a note on an inscription that is of great importance for our understanding of the Gupta-Vākāṭaka period of Indian history, the Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta. 

Skandagupta’s Bhitarī Inscription vv. 8–12 

This inscription has been published several times: 3 by Fleet in CII III (1888), 52–56, by Sircar in SI I, 321–324, by Bhandarkar in CII III (1981), 312–317, 

2 The conference went ahead, sadly without A.ṀShastri, in Groningen from 6 to 8 June 2002. The proceedings were published in 2004 (Bakker 2004d).

18 / A Note on Skandagupta’s Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription 375 

and most recently by D´aniel Balogh forthcoming. In addition, the inscription has been discussed by several scholars, among whom Chhabra 1963, Mirashi 1982a, Agrawal 1986, 54–66, and Willis 2009, 144–49. 

In his New Light on a Period in Gupta History Mirashi focused his attention on the verses 4 to 8 and argued that these verses ‘refer to three different strug gles in which Skandagupta was involved’. 4 Broadly speaking, I have followed Mirashi’s argument, 5 and I would now like to discuss the concluding part of the inscription, verses 8 to 12, in which the immediate reason of the epigraph is given. 

In verse 8, in which Skandagupta’s victory over the Hūṇas is reported, the twanging sound of a bow is referred to in a simile that is part of Skandagupta’s swagger. 6 It appears natural that the mentioning of the bow (śārṅga) implies Skandagupta, which would mean that his bow is meant. 

Verse 9 is nearly completely illegible, but a connection is made in it between Skandagupta’s deeds and his father (svapituh.) Kumāragupta. It should be observed that kīrtti, apparently the first word of a compound, could refer to fame or anything that brings fame, e.g. a temple. 

The first three syllables of pāda a of the next verse (10) are lost. Fleet and Sircar conjectured kartavyā (Bhandarkar prakāryā), but an ingenious con jecture was made by Chhabra 1963, 546: na yasya (quoted with approval by Agrawal 1986, 63). It gives significance to the double occurrence of the word pratimā in the first hemistich—more meaningful, in my view, than the pedes trian ‘an image should be made’ of Fleet, Sircar, and Bhandarkar—to the effect that, although God Viṣṇu is admittedly transcendent, that is without form (na yasya pratimā kācit), a material image of Him in his manifestation of Sārṅgin can be made. I therefore take the genitive, ‘of that wielder of the ´ bow’ (tasya śārṅgiṇah.) in 10b as depending on (pratimām. ) and referring to the deity; the form chosen, that of the archer, implements a comparison with Kumāragupta or Skandagupta (cf. 8b, 8d)—both certainly mighty bowmen to judge by their coinage. 7 The pratimām. . . . imām (10bc) of Viṣṇu-Sārṅgin is ´ the deity installed, whose name, as proposed by Bhandarkar, may have been Kumārasvāmin. 8 

In the Mahābhārata Vāsudeva’s and/or Kr̥ṣṇa’s bow is called Sārṅga. It is ´ the divine vaiṣṇava bow. 9 Curiously enough, the term or name Sārṅgin does ´ 

4 Mirashi 1982a, 70 related the first of this struggles to the Indore Plates of Pravarasena II, Year 23 and argued that the ‘un-named enemies of the Guptas included the Vākāṭakas’ (cf. above, p. 146 and n. 29 on p. 325). 

5 Bakker 1997, 25–28. Cf. Bakker 2006. 

6 8d: śārṅgadhvaniḥ, read by Fleet as gˆaṅgadhvanih.. The correct reading has been sug gested by Jagan Nath and was taken over by Bhandarkar and Sircar in their editions. 7 See Kumāragupta’s and Skandagupta’s Archer Type and Skandagupta’s so-called ‘King and-Lakṣmī Type’ of gold coins (above, p. 316 and Plate 48). 

8 Fleet suggested yāvadācandratārakam, accepted by Sircar, but rejected by Bhandarkar, who points out that ‘if yāvat is used, ā◦ is superfluous’ (CII III (1981), 315 n. 4.). On top of that, the expression seems to be out of place here.

not occur in the critical text of either the Mahābhārata or the Rāmāyaṇa. It does occur, however in the *-passages in the critical apparatus and appendices of the MBh edition as a name of Vāsudeva-Kr̥ṣṇa. 10 From this it follows that the word Sārṅgin as a name of Vāsudeva is comparatively late, attested only in ´ the later phase of the composition of the epic, that is the 3rd to 5th centuries ad. This agrees well with the evidence of the inscriptioṇIt is therefore reasonable to assume that the Sārṅgin mentioned in verse 10 is considered to be a form of ´ Vāsudeva, the Bhagavat (v. 12). 11 

It is clear that in verse 10 Skandagupta is credited with the making of an image of a deity that is known to be a mighty archer and as such reflects the qualities of himself and his father. In view of the fact that the merit of this act is assigned to the deceased father, Kumāragupta, the name suggested for the installed image, Kumārasvāmin, is a plausible conjecture. It has a contempo rary parallel in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription, in which the merit of the installation of the deity Prabhāvatisvāmin is assigned to Kumāragupta’s sister, the deceased Vākāṭaka queen, Prabhāvatī Guptā. 12 

The puzzle in v. 11 is to whom/which (the masculine) enam, as read by Fleet, Sircar and Bhandarkar, in pāda a refers. It would normally be something that is already mentioned (anvādeśa), something that is now being installed at the site (iha). It can hardly be anything else but the deity (devam), supposedly mentioned in 10d, i.e. KumārasvāmiṇA good suggestion made by D´aniel Balogh is to read (feminine) enām. , which naturally refers to the pratimā of the preceding verse. Pādas 11cd add that a village or community (grāma) is assigned (vidhā-) to the deity (i.e. to the temple and its priests) and that the merit of this deed accrues to Kumāragupta. 13 

This appears to be one of two (ubhayam) acts that are performed for the benefit of the father (12cd). Which is the other one? I think we can exclude the erection of the column itself, as proposed by Bhandarkar, 14 since the inscription does not say anything explicit about it. This would leave the following possibil ities: 1) the making (cakāra) of the image, or, 2) the installation (pratiṣṭhāpya) of the image, or, 3) a combination of 1) and 2). The last possibility seems the most plausible one, that is, if we analyse verse 12 correctly. 

Verse 11 is a syntactically independent clause: ‘having done so and so, he assigned the village/community. . . ’. This suggests that v. 12 is also a syntacti cally complete clause, consisting of a relative clause (12ab), in which two things 

10 MBh 1 App. I No. 114 l. 339, 7.59 *440, 12 App. I No. 6 l. 29, 17.1 *3, 18.5 *30. Cf. Kālidāsa’s Meghadūta 1.46 and Amarakośa 1.1.19. 

11 Vāsudeva is used synonymously with Kr̥ṣṇa (sometimes equated with Viṣṇu). It is extremely unlikely that it refers to Rāma. 

12 Bakker 1997, 166 v. 21; above, p. 124. 

13 The grāma is not specified in the legible part of the inscription, but, in view of the use again of the pronoun enam in 11c, it has probably been mentioned earlier as well, maybe in v. 9; the place of residence may have been the site where the inscribed column is found, i.e. the present Bhitarī. 

14 CII III (1981), 317 n. 4. 







18 / A Note on Skandagupta’s Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription 377 

are mentioned, and a main clause (12cd). The crux of the verse is pāda b. Fleet and Sircar read ‘iyaṁyaś cātra saṁsthitah. ’ (with question marks), Bhandarkar (Chhabra and Gai) proposes: ‘iyaṁyaś cātra [sa ˙mskri(r. )tah. ]’ (op. cit. 316). One would assume that the act of saṁskr.- (consecration) is normally comprised in the ritual of pratiṣṭhā- (installation) and plays no role here. iyaṁis signif icant: it may correspond to mūrtir in pāda a, but it stands after the caesura in the next pāda. This means that pāda 12b actually recapitulates the two things that are referred to by ubhayam in 12c: 1) this one here (namely, the image), and (ca) 2) ‘who/that which is here sam. ...’. This interpretation takes pāda 12a in apposition to iyam. . Fleet’s and Sircar’s reading saṁsthitaḥcould be understood as a periphrase of grāmaḥ: ‘the one who is living here, (i.e. the community)’, although it remains slightly unsatisfactory. Willis 2009, 148 f. has reexamined the case in detail and reads saṁśritaḥ, which gives the better sense: that which has been ‘attached’ or ‘consigned’, viz. to the installed deity. 

My comprehensive understanding of the proclamation made in vv. 8–12 is presented in a critical edition and translation of the text in the Appendix. 

Concluding remarks on the inscription and the site of Bhitarī 

To sum up, the purport of the inscription is to proclaim, in additon to Skanda gupta’s victories on the battle field, that Skandagupta installed an image of Vāsudeva–Sārṅgin, possibly named Kumārasvāmin, a deity who is a great ´ archer and as such reflects the qualities of the emperor and his father. For the maintenance of the image/temple Skandagupta assigns a village or com munity to the deity, that is to say, he exempts this community from taxes, so that its surplus production from now on may be used for worship of the deity and maintenance of the temple. Both beneficial acts are performed to increase the merit of his deceased father, Kumāragupta. 

Finally I would like to draw attention to an important remark made in the Introduction of the 1981-edition of CII III. On page 83 it is observed: ‘In fact, Bhitarī is studded with so many mounds that it is not impossible that it was the mausoleum or pratimā-gr̥iha of the Gupta family.’ 15 This hypothesis has only partly been corroborated by the excavations carried out by the Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Banaras Hindu University, between the years 1968 and 1973, and 1995. 16 A proper assessment of these excavations reported by Vidula Jayaswal (2001), would go beyond the scope of this article. One photograph, taken from the excavator’s website, 17 may give an impression of the situation (Plate 76). 

15 For the concept of the pratimāgr̥ha and memorial temples see below, p. 415 (Bakker 2007a, 19–23). 

16 Jayaswal 2001, vii.

Above we adduced the parallel example of the foundation of the Prabhāvati svāmin temple on the Rāmagiri. In discussing this and neighbouring temples on this hill, I have argued that these sanctuaries were erected to transfer merit to the deceased members of the Vākāṭaka family. 18

I would be hesitant to call these temples ‘mausoleums’, since they were certainly no tombs or cenotaphs, nor is it at all likely that portraits (otherwise than through metaphor) of the deceased were set up, and maybe even the designation ‘memorial’ is misleading, but these temples seem to have served some funerary or commemorative function, namely to ensure the salvation of the deceased by means of a transfer of merit. 19 An evaluation of the results of the excavations by Vidula Jayaswal and his team and further research must establish whether or not the site of Bhitarī served such aims in Gupta times. I for one conclude with a paraphrase of Skandagupta’s words:

The So-called 

‘Jaunpur Stone Inscription of Īśvaravarman’∗ 

Preamble 

Few scholars can claim mastery of such a wide range of different fields within the discipline of Indology as Prof Dr Oskar von Hinüber. One of the branches of learning that owes a great deal to his studies is Indian epigraphy. My con tribution here is meant as a humble tribute to Oskar and his work. 

Introduction 

We possess two inscriptions that undisputably belong to that branch of the Maukhari family which eventually turned the ancient Kānyakubja (Kanauj) into their new capital, viz. the well-known Haraha Stone Inscription of Īśānavarman of Vikrama Samvat 611 (ad 554), in which Īśānavarman’s son Sūryavarman records his renovation of a dilapidated Siva temple, and an ´ inscription found in Jaunpur. 1 The Jaunpur Inscription is merely ‘a fragment of a very much larger inscription’. 2 It deserves a detailed examination. 

It is estimated that only about one-third of the width of the inscribed stone has been preserved (Plate 77), and it is unknown how many lines would have been below the last line extant. Fleet remarks that ‘the probability is [. . . ] that the larger number (seventy-two) has been lost at the beginning of this (i.e. first) line, and in proportion all the way down’. 3 The other option considered by Fleet is that only thirty-eight syllables are missing at the beginning of each line. This option is invalidated by the Sārdūlavikrīd ´ . ita verse in line 3, of which the end coincides with the right side of the stone. From this and the preceding incomplete Mālinī verse of line 2 it can be deduced that altogether 69 syllables have been lost in line 3. This would bring the total number of akṣaras in line 3

to 91. 4 Since the whole inscription consists of verses, it should be possible to estimate how many akṣaras have been lost in each line, notwithstanding Fleet’s admittance that he has ‘tried several ways of arranging the verses, [. . . ], but without being able to satisfy myself’. 5 It appears that the number of akṣaras per line varied between 91 and 99. 

The inscription was published again in Thaplyal 1985, but he too refrained from a restoration of the distribution of verses. Earlier Sircar had reconstructed three verses along the lines we propose to follow here for the inscription as a whole. 6

4 That a line could contain slightly more syllables than 91 emerges from ‘scroll-work to fill up the line’ that follows the punctuation mark that concludes the Sārdūlavikrīd ´ . ita verse (CII III (1888), 229 n. 7).

19 / The So-called ‘Jaunpur Stone Inscription of Īśvaravarman’ 383 

The inscription had been ascribed to Īśvaravarman, on account of the fact that he is the only king mentioned by name in the fragment. When we collate our reconstruction with the Haraha Inscription, it appears that a similar pattern underlies both praśastis and that it is highly unlikely that Īśvaravarman was the last king mentioned, a conclusion also reached by Sircar 1964, though on other grounds. 7 Both praśastis, however, are independent compositions and it is impossible to say which one of them is the older, although the Haraha Inscription seems to be slightly more ornate, having e.g. two maṅgala verses (the second one apparently drawing inspiration from the Kṣemeśvara Temple, the object of the inscription) against one in the Jaunpur InscriptioṇIn the underlying pattern two verses are reserved for Harivarman and Adityavarman ¯ in both inscriptions; Īśvaravarman has three verses in the Haraha Inscription and three or two in the Jaunpur one, depending on whether one assigns verse 8 to him or to his son ĪśānavarmaṇThe latter possibility is the most likely, in view of the explicit mention of the ‘lion throne’, which we also encounter in the Haraha Inscription verse 13. In the Haraha Inscription Īśānavarman has five verses dedicated solely to him, whereas in the sixth his son Sūryavarman is introduced. The pattern we conjecture in the Jaunpur Inscription gives to Īśānavarman at least five verses, while it remains unclear whether a son is introduced in verses 12 or 13. The Jaunpur inscription may therefore have belonged to either Īśānavarman or to one of his successors. 

An edition of the thus reconstructed text of the inscription is presented be low, which is followed by my translatioṇIn the footnotes to this translation the parallel verses of the Haraha Inscription are given together with my translation thereof. 

The Jaunpur Stone Inscription 

The reconstruction follows basically the text of Fleet with some minor adap tations, using, for instance, standard orthography. The bold figures between square brackets are the line numbers. Angular brackets (in edition and trans lation) are used to indicate that the reading is conjectured. Commas indicate the end of uneven pādas. The verse numbering is mine. 

7 Sircar 1964, 129 draws this conclusion from verse 11, in which the king’s victory over the Andhras is celebrated. This victory was obtained by Īśānavarman, as Haraha Inscription verse 13 tells us (see below, n. 26 on p. 388).

[Īśanavarman] ¯ is victorious, he who has ascended the lion throne, his feet bowed to by the rulers of the earth, after having vanquished the sovereign of Andhra of whom the elephants, counted by the thousands, were passing triple fluid (scil., temple-must secretion, urine and faeces, due to excitement), after having routed in battle the Sū likas and their galloping arrays of innumerable horses, and after having made the Gauḍas, driven from their territory by (his) might, take refuge at the ocean. (13) 

27 Sircar 1964, 130 is right when he notes that, ‘The word dhārā commonly means khaḍgāder niśitamukham (Medinīkoṣa), so that the passage dhārāmārgavinirgatāgnikaṇikā means “the sparks issuing from the passage of the [hero’s] sword” and has nothing to do with the city of Dhārā.’ However, the use of the word mārga in this interpretation remains problematic. For dhārā in the sense of ‘rim of an (iron) wheel’ see Raghuvaṁśa 13.15. 

28 Sircar 1964, 128 conjectures that it was an unknown enemy, other than the Lord of Andhra, who fled to the Raivataka hill. The hill has not satisfactorily been identified. To go by its name it may have been a hill along the Revā (= Narmadā) River. A hill of this name is mentioned in the Junāgaḍh Rock Inscription of Skandagupta. Fleet identifies this Raivataka with the hill ‘opposite to Urjayat or Girnˆar’ in Kathiawar, ˆ Gujarat ( CII III (1888), 64 n. 1). 

29 This seems to refer to an expedition to the northwest, possibly corresponding with the Sūlikas mentioned in the Haraha Inscription (see above, n. 26 on p. 388). 







19 / The So-called ‘Jaunpur Stone Inscription of Īśvaravarman’ 389 

to Īśvaravarman virtuousness, and to Īśānavarman emperorship. The latter was credited with the title Mahārājādhirāja in the seals of his successors and in the inscriptions he is said to be seated on the lion throne. His son Sūryavarman was a young man in Vikrama Saṁvat 611 (=ad 554), the date of the Haraha Inscription. Īśānavarman’s exploits may therefore have taken place in the se cond quarter of the 6th century. Whether or not the heroic deeds of one of Īśānavarman’s descendants were described in the missing part of the inscrip tion will forever remain unknown. 

By placing the two Maukhari inscriptions side by side, we have won a more secure basis from which the individual achievements of each of the Maukhari kings and the Maukhari history as such can be studies. The results of this study are found in Bakker 2014, The World of the Skandapurāṇa. The sixth century is generally considered as a ‘dark age’ and for that reason every piece of evidence should be treasured. It is hoped that the present preliminary study of the source material will contribute to the historiography of the Maukharis in general and may be of use to scholars who, like the present author, are fascinated by an age that started with the fall of a great empire and culminated in the magnificent rule of Harṣavardhana. 









The Temple of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin∗ 

The Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription of the Time of Udayasena 

Reconsidered 

Introduction 

The hill near the village Ramgarh, on whose top (height 184 m) the so-called ‘Muṇḍeśvarī Temple’ is found, 1 belongs to the northern spurs of the Kaimur Range, the eastern embranchment of the Vindhyas. It is situated in the Kaimur District of southwest Bihar, 70 km SE of Vārāṇasī, 170 km SW of Patna, 60 km NW of Rohtasgarh on the River Son, and 8 km SW of Bhabua, as the crow flies. 

The present octogonal temple has attracted the attention of scholars since the early days of Francis Buchanan, whose description had been used by Mont gomery Martin in his Eastern India, which appeared in 1838. Buchanan reports that his description is based on the drawings of a painter whom he had sent up to the place, which might have taken place in January 1813. 2 A print based on this was included in Martin’s Eastern India (Plate 78). Earlier a drawing of the temple had been made by Thomas Daniell (Plate 79), who probably visited the site in February 1790, 3 and whose engraving, published in 1808, might have been known to Buchanan. 4 As can be derived from both pictures, the temple was largely covered by a mound of rubble overgrown with plants and trees. The site was excavated by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) after a visit of Theodor Bloch in 1902. 5 Bloch was also the first to report on the inscription that is the subject of this paper. He notes the following (op. cit. 43): 

[. . . ] Among the d´ebris the second half of an inscribed stone has been found, the first half of which had been sent to the Indian Museum Calcutta in 1891. 

∗ The first version of this article was published in Indo-Iranian Journal 56.3–4 (2013), 263–77. This double issue of IIJ contained the articles based on papers given at the symposium Epigraphical Evidence for the Formation and Rise of Early Saivism ´ , which was held at the University of Groningen, 4–5 June 2012. 

1 The temple and hill are named after the goddess who today is the central focus of worship (see Jayasal 2017, 117 Fig. 340). 

2 Nuess 2003, 533 (based on Oldham 1926). Martin 1838 I, 456: ‘I could not conveniently visit the place, but sent a painter, who drew the most remarkable part. The temple, now very ruinous, has been an octagon supported by four columns (E).’

The two halves of the stone have been combined and were first edited and published by R.d. Banerji in Epigraphia Indica IX (1907–08). 

This Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription of the Time of Udayasena, Year 30 has gone through altogether five editions (R.d. Banerji 1907–08, ṇG. Majumdar 1920, P.K. Agrawala 1987, P.R̥Srinivasan 1991, J. Neuss 2003), but in spite of the work done by these excellent epigraphists, I think there is still room for improvement. 8 

The temple on Muṇḍeśvarī Hill 

Before discussing the inscription in more detail, however, a few words should be said about the temple. Joanna Williams gives the following assessment. 

Fragments at the site extend from the sixth century until the eighth or later. On stylistic grounds the surviving octagonal shrine should belong to the first half of the seventh century. [. . . ] 9

The hill, temple, surrounding d´ebris, and the inscription have been thoroughly examined by Jürgen Neuss (2003). 12 Neuss subscribes to the almost universally accepted theory that dates the oldest elements of the architecture of the present

11 ‘Interior of the temple of Mandeswara near Chaynpore, Bahar.’ Cf. Archer 1980, Plate 77. 

12 More recently another inventory of the remains on the hill was made by Fiona Buckee (2008). She generously shared her photo documentation with me. In 2018 Buckee presented a paper The Curious Case of the Octagonal Temple: A Revised History of the Temples of Mundeshvari Hill in the 24th Conference of the EASAA in Naples, 2–6 July 2018. I refer to this as Buckee forthcoming. Again another extensive survey of the archaeological remains of the hill, in situ and in museums, was made by Meera Sharma 2017. It is included in Jayaswal et al. 2017. This latest inventory is not incorporated in the present essay. Finally an extensive treatment of the historic evidence regarding Muṇḍeśvarī Hill is found in Bakker 2014, 221–39. 









temple to the first half of the seventh century. 13 However, Neuss rejects one piece of evidence used to endorse this theory, viz. the alleged contemporaneity of the temple and the inscription. 14 

The date of the Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription 

Neuss’s main arguments run as follows. Firstly, there is no reason to assume that ‘the year 30’ refers to the Harṣa Era, as has been done by all scholars following Bloch (see above), apart from Majumdar, who takes it to refer to the Gupta Era. Nuess refers to Asher, who had argued ‘that in the ancient written documents of eastern India, time was almost invariably marked according to the regnal year of a current monarch’, 15 and, Neuss continues, ‘that there is thus no basis to connect the date of our inscription with any known era’. 16 

Secondly, a detailed palæographic investigation leads him to the final obser vation that, 

As the Muṇḍeśvarī record still uses the older tripartite ya, I would suggest that the Muṇḍeśvarī inscription must have been engraved between A.D. 570 and A.D. 590, and that the script shows influences from writing habits developed in Western India. 17 

I subscribe tentatively to Neuss’s analysis and would therefore propose to date the inscription to the second half of the sixth or early seventh century. It follows that the otherwise completely unknown Mahāsāmanta Udayasena was a feuda tory, not of Harṣavardhana, but of the Maukharis of Kanauj, and most likely ruled under Avantivarman, the last of the great Maukhari kings of Kanauj, whose reign spanned the final decades of the sixth and beginning of the sev enth century. The inscription is not the foundation charter of the main temple itself, but it testifies to a historical process in the second half of the 6th century, in which the building of a new religious complex on the hill was in full swing. 

Neuss presents a new edition of the inscription and his interpretation thereof has important consequences for his understanding of the type and development of the sacred complex on the hill. The reading and interpretation of the in scription that I present here differ significantly from the one given by Neuss. Our disagreement is mainly the result of a different interpretation of the signs that are found at the end of line 6 and 11 and in the middle of line 16:   . Neuss, following Majumdar, takes these as daṇḍas that conclude a sentence. 

13 Neuss 2003, 543. The temple has a long history of reconstructions. Its architectural history has been investigated by Adam Hardy and Fiona Buckee. Buckee (forthcoming) concludes that the present octagonal shape of the temple may go back to a reconstruc tion, influenced by nearby Suri tombs, made in the 16th or 17th century. The present appearance of the temple is due to a ‘creative restauration’ made between 1913–1916.

In my view this interpretation is untenable, because it would break up the sentence constructioṇIn line 6 the Sanskrit syntax requires that we do not read a pause after ◦devakulasya, since this is the adject of upanibandhaḥkāritaḥin line 9. If we would take this sign as a daṇḍa in line 11, it would separate the subject from the predicate: . . . ◦upakaraṇāni ... dattāni (l. 12). For these reasons I follow the suggestion first made by Banerji to the effect that, ‘The sign at the end of this line has been added in order to fill up the vacant space.’ 18 Similar scroll-work is, for instance, found at the end of line 3 (after the dou ble daṇḍa that concludes v. 4) of the so-called ‘Jaunpur Stone Inscription of Īśānavarman’. 19 In line 16 of our inscription the double scroll sign is used to fill up the line and, concomitantly, to mark a new paragraph, uktaṁca, so that the concluding, exhortative verse could begin on a new line. 

My edition is presented in two ways: first, a literal transliteration of what is readable; second, an edited version with conjectural emendations and stan dardized orthography. My study is based on the estampage supplied by Sten Konow and published by Banerji in Epigraphia Indica IX (Plate 82).

It looks as if there is an anusvāra above this i-mātrā, but this may be just damage or there might have been one more akṣara on this line, pressed together due to lack of space (cf. the haplography that occurs at the end of line 8 where ◦dvayaṁshould be read as ◦dvayasya).

22 Irregular for triṁśattame, maybe under influence of the following dvāviṁśatime, which is haplographic for dvāviṁśatitame (Oberlies 2003, 127). As argued above the year 30 is best explained, if we assume that it refers to regnal years. The only dated Maukhari inscription (the Haraha Inscription of Īśānavarman, EI XIV, 110–20) is assigned to the Vikrama Era, 611 (ad 554). The dates on the Maukhari coins are problematic: difficult to read and difficult to assign to any known era (see Burn 1906; EI XIV, 113; HCI III, 70). I presume with Asher, Neuss, and Singh that the present ‘year 30’ refers to the thirtieth year of Udayasena’s governorship (rājya). 

23 Maybe to be emended to asyām. . As it stands, I take this synonymous with atra or iha. 24 The reading ◦rājodayasena◦ was first proposed by Banerji and taken over by all later editors. That we are here concerned with a feudatory rather than a sovereign king follows from his titles (three (of five) Mahāśabdas), bestowed upon him by a suzerain: mahāsāmanta, ‘feudatory’; mahāpratīhāra, ‘chief chamberlain’; mahārāja, ‘viceroy’. The monarch who had bestowed these titles may have been either Sarvavarman or Avanti- ´ varman, Maukhari kings of Kanauj, who were themselves called great on account of their overlordship of Magadhā’ (magadhādhipatyamahatām), in the Sirpur Lakṣmaṇa Temple Stone Inscription of the time of Sivagupta Bālārjuna ´ (Shastri 1995 II, 143; EI XI, 191). 25 For this reading see above n. 20 on p. 396. As has been remarked by Sanderson (e mail 15-2-2012), the beginning with bhā suggests a Pāśupata name, but no satisfactory interpretation has suggested itself. I conjecture bhānūdayim. , assuming that the curve to the left at the bottom (note also the little vertical stroke above the akṣara) indicate the long vowel ū; cf. nu in line 18. The noun udayin is declined here as a vowel stem in i (Oberlies 2003, 94). 

26 Banerji reads maṭham etat kāritaka ˙m, but Majumdar noted that the inscription actually reads mayetat kāritakam. . We agree with Banerji, just as Neuss (cf. Srinivasan 1991, 315). The end of this sentence kāritakaṁremains noticeable (cf. Fleet in CII III, 69, 113, 135; Oberlies 2003, 267 n. 3). 

27 The syntax requires that we read ◦dvayasya, as first suggested by Majumdar. 

28 The reading copanibandhaḥ, proposed by Banerji, was taken over by all later editors.

Translation 

Success! 

In the thirtieth year, at the twenty-second day of Kārttika; here, at the above year, month and day—within the reign of the illustrious Mahāsāmanta, Mahāpratīhāra, Mahārāja Udayasena—after having requested the permission of the head of the community (kulapati), Bhānūdayin (?), and the Temple Council, General Gomibhaṭa has commissioned the building of this accomo dation as part of the Vinīteśvaramaṭha, in order to increase the merit of his father, mother, and himself. 

He has made an assignment to the temple of the illustrious Nārāyaṇa of a pala of lampoil and two prasthas of rice for the daily food-offering (to the deity), permanently, for as long as sun and moon exist, to be taken from the storeroom that belongs to the temple of the illustrious Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin. 

(And) to the Temple Council he has given the means, such as cows, offerings, garlands, and food, at the value of fifty dīnāras, meant collectively for the 

29 This is a real crux interpretum. Banerji (followed by Singh) proposed to read: vicchitti viśrānta◦. Majumdar read vicchitti nta◦ and acknowledged that he was ‘unable to interpret this passage’. Srinivasan reads: vici (chehitti) . . . . Agrawala: vicchitti nimitta◦; Neuss: vicchittimānta◦. I tentatively read: vicitrakarmāntatantra◦. 

30 The reading gobalisrajabhaktādy◦ was first proposed by Majumdar and was taken over by Neuss. After this follows scroll-work to fill up the line. 

31 Banerji proposed to read here (see also beginning of next line): dattam etad evam, corrected by the editor of EI (Sten Konow), to dattāny etad evam, which was taken over by Majumdar and Neuss. I see no reason to conjecture etad. If there is room for one more syllable I would conjecture: dattānītyevam. 

32 Banerji conjectured yathānibaddhasya, corrected by Majumdar to yathopanibaddhasya, taken over by Neuss. 

33 ’nyathā first conjectured by Banerji and taken over by all later editors. 

34 saha narake first conjectured by Banerji and taken over by all later editors. 35 The akṣara preceding dhā (just after the gap) was read as va by Banerji and Srinivasan (reading ava◦), and vā by Majumdar, who conjectures yathāvadhāraṇayā, taken over by Neuss.

regular set of various observances for the sake of the illustrious feet of Maṇḍa leśvarasvāmin. 

Having learned so, there should not be a disruption of what has thus been assigned, neither by future incumbents nor by the ascetics. 

The one who, having thus been informed, acts otherwise, will live in hell with great sins. 

Thus [. . . ] 

And it has been declared, 

O Yudhiṣṭhira, zealously protect the land, whether it has been given by yourself or by others. O foremost of the landlords, protection is superior to giving. 

Interpretation 

General Gomibhaṭa made altogether three donations, for which he had to make two formal requests, namely one to the head (kulapati) of the Vinīte- śvara(maṭha), and the other to the Temple Council (devanikāya), of which he himself may have been a member. 37 The task of the Devanikāya may have been to supervise and administer the temple properties on the hill and that of the Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin temple complex (devakula) in particular. The mem bership of general Gomibhaṭa of such a council would not be surprising, if we consider the people who are reported to sit on such a council. To this effect the Taleśvara Copperplate Grant of Dyutivarman provides information. 38 The latter grant was made at the request of the Mahāsattrapati Trāta and the Deva nikāya, ‘which was headed by the minister Bhadraviṣṇu, the governor of the fort, the officer in charge of the king’s betel-box, the custodian of the sacrificial fire, and the head of the royal guard’. 39 

Gomibhaṭa needed the permission of kulapati Bhānūdayin for his first dona tion, viz. accomodation or housing (maṭha) for the ascetics, since that was to be built on the premises of the Vinīteśvaramaṭha. The word kulapati poses a problem. Literally it signifies ‘head of a community’. Because the community here is defined as that of a maṭha, a likely interpretation is that the kulapati is 

37 If we read with Neuss svadevanikāya in l. 4, this membership would be explicit. 38 EI XIII No. 7, 109–21: Two Talesvara Copperplates by Y.R̥Gupte (1915–16). These two copperplates have been found in Taleśvara in the Almore District, United Provinces (modern Uttarakhand). Though they appear to be forgeries, they are nevertheless doc uments pertaining to the period ‘between the middle of the 6th and second quarter of the 7th century’ (Gupte op. cit. 113), i.e. to the same period as to which the Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription belongs. 

39 EI XIII, 115 ll. 6–8: rājadauvārikāgnisvāmikāraṅkikakoṭādhikaraṇikāmātyabhadraviṣṇu puraḥsareṇa ca devanikāyena vijñāpitam. , which is rendered by Gupte as ‘preceded by royal doorkeepers, the attendants of the sacred fire, the kāraṅkikas, the superintendent of the female (temple) slaves, the minister Bhadraviṣṇu’. 









the Mahant or abbot of the community of ascetics (tāpovanikas) of the Vinī teśvaramaṭha. 40 Alternatively, as was pointed out to me in the conference, kulapati may be shorthand for devakulapati, ‘head of the temple’, in which case probably the temple connected to the maṭha was meant. 

He needed the approval of the Temple Council for his second donation, viz. a daily offering of lampoil and rice meant for the Nārāyaṇa Temple (devakula), since this was to be taken from the storeroom (koṣṭhikā) connected to the Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin Temple. How this was paid for remains unclear, unless we assume that the third donation to the Temple Council was considered to be sufficient to cover the costs of this as well. 

His third donation to the Temple Council, for which he also needed approval, was meant for the worship of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin himself and is said to have had a value of 50 dīnāras. For this amount he provided the means needed for worshipping the deity, such as milk (a cow), food and garlands, epitomized in the words vicitrakarmāntatantra◦ (regular set of various observances), if our conjecture (l. 10) is correct. 

The inscription attests to the existence, in the second half of the 6th cen tury, of a main Saiva temple complex, called Man ´ . ḍaleśvara. Connected to this temple was a storeroom, which could also supply the daily offerings for a minor Vaiṣṇava sanctuary dedicated to Nārāyaṇa. In addition, and possibly closely connected to the Maṇḍaleśvara complex, was a monastery of Saiva ascetics, ´ named Vinīteśvaramaṭha. Whether there was a temple or shrine of Vinīte- śvara cannot be deduced from this inscription with certainty, but the existence at the time of such a temple is very likely indeed. The monastery or/and its temple was headed by Bhānūdayin. 

Maṇḍaleśvara and the Skandapuraṉ .a 

This is as far as epigraphy (and archaeology) can bring us. It does not tell us why ascetics and pilgrims flocked to this hill in great numbers. Why the site was considered holy. In order to answer these questions we need texts, and such a text has become available. I refer to the original Skandapurāṇa. 

In the context of the Kauśikī Cycle the Skandapurāṇa contains a Maṇḍa leśvara Māhātmya.41 This Māhātmya tells the story of the demons Sunda and Nisunda and the nymph Tilottamā, also known from the Mahābhārata,42 which serves as an aetiological myth of the origin of the caturmukhaliṅga. 

40 Cf. Vallabhadeva ad Raghuvaṁśa 1.94, who glosses kulapatinā as āśramaguruṇā. Par allels for this usage are also found in Khmer inscriptions (Cœdes 1937–66) K 95, K 309, K 362. 

41 The credit for the discovery of the relevance of this text for the Muṇḍeśvarī Hill goes to Yuko Yokochi (Yokochi 2005, 88 n. 28). 

42 MBh 1.200.18–204.26; Mbh 13.128.1–6. See Bakker 2001; below, pp. 489 ff. 





20 / The Temple of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin 401 

Tilottamā, her creator Brahmā, and the other gods assemble in the Vindhyas for worshipping Siva, but he is invisible at first. Then ´ Siva appears on the scene ´ in the form of a liṅga. When Tilottamā makes her pradakṣiṇā around him (and the gods), four faces emerge on the four sides of the liṅga, which gives her the power of sexual desire, the tejas, namely, that had been stored within Siva ever ´ since he had burnt Madana. Thus the caturmukhaliṅga comes into being (SP 62.8–26). Then Siva says that, ´ 

Because she [Tilottamā], as well as the gods, has circumambulated Him in a circle (maṇḍala), this place on Mt. Vindhya, which is sacred to Him, will be called Ma ṇḍaleśvara, and He will always be present here. 43 

The story continues, again in the words of Yokochi. 

After sending Tilottamā to the demons, all the gods huddle together. They see Parameśvara in their midst. Because He appeared in the midst of the gods while they were huddling together (piṇḍyamāna), He was called Piṇḍāreśvara there. 44 

A holy place called Piṇḍāraka is known to the Mahābhārata (MBh 13.26.54), and other places with this name are known to several Purāṇas. The Piṇḍāreśvara at issue, however, must be located in the vicinity of Maṇḍaleśvara. The word piṇḍāra means mendicant and the aetiological myth told in the Skandapurāṇa probably refers to a local liṅga that was worshipped by Saiva ´ ascetics. 

The place where our text locates these two liṅgas is in the northern part of the Vindhyas, since Tilottamā is said to go to the south to find the two demons in the foothills of the Vindhya (vindhyapādeṣu). Our investigation thus seems to corroborate Yokochi’s hypothesis, to the effect that both Skandapurāṇa liṅgas are to be situated on the Muṇḍeśvarī Hill— the Maṇḍaleśvara being the ancient caturmukhaliṅga preserved on the site near the main, octagonal temple and named as such in the Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription, Year 30, and the Piṇḍāreśvara being one of the many of 5th to 7th century liṅgas that are scattered all over the hill, possibly the 5th or 6th century ekamukhaliṅga found at site A. 45

Old caturmukhaliṅga 46 Ekamukhaliṅga of site A 47 

Once the hill had established its reputation, it began to attract patronage of the elite. Gomibhaṭa exemplifies this development and we have suggested elsewhere that the Vinīteśvara temple may have been founded by someone named Vinīta, who may have ruled from the stronghold of near-by Rohitāgiri, Rohtasgarh. 48 The inscription and earliest archaeological material on the hill belong to the period in which we date the beginning of the Skandapurāṇa composition, that is after ad 550, when North India became united again, for the first time since the fall of the Gupta Empire, under the Maukhari rulers, whose homeland was in the near-by valley of the River SoṇIt is the period in which the Saiva movement was beginning to organize itself through sectarian settlements ´ 

46 This liṅga is found in the temple compound, near the entrance. Neuss 2003, 546 n. 37: ‘This caturmukhaliṅga seems to be the model for the one which is at present in the temple and which most likely is a substitute for the former.’ Photo by the author (2011). 

47 This liṅga is presently stored within the temple. For its history see Neuss 2003, 546 f. It came from ‘site A’. Photo courtesy of F. Buckee (2008). 

48 In inscriptions of the Tu˙nga dynasty, ruling in the tenth century as feudatories of the Bauma-Kara kings of Orissa in the Yamagarta-maṇḍala in the Dhenkanal District of Central Orissa, this dynasty of petty kings claims that its ancestor, named Vinīta, came originally from the Rohitāgiri.

or maṭhas in centres of pilgrimage that were on the rise, such as Vārāṇasī. Muṇḍeśvarī Hill, that is Maṇḍaleśvara, may have been a knot in the emerging network of Pāśupata ascetics, important enough to deserve a Māhātmya of its own in one of the movement’s greatest literary undertakings, the Purāṇa of Skanda. 49

Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India∗ 

Preamble 

The scope of this study is limited to funerary practices within the brahmini cal (Hindu) fold of the ancient period, i.e. North India from the Vedic Age to the reign of King Harṣavardhana (7th century). Funerary practices in South India, Dravida country, and Southeast Asia seem to have differed significantly from those in North India. 1 They deserve a study of their owṇIn late me dieval North India new forms of commemoration (samādhis, chatarīs) emerged, possibly under Islamic influence. 2 

The funerary monument in Sanskrit literature 

We possess a moving literary description of what the death of a king—great in the eyes of his contemporaries—brought about, how it was experienced by the court, and which ritual and ceremonies were performed to cope with the calamity. Bāṇa in Harṣacarita 5 tells us that, even before the actual demise of Harṣa’s father, Prabhākaravardhana, the latter’s first wife, Queen Yaśovatī, was so overwhelmed by grief and the prospect of widowhood that she, against the express wish of her son, committed herself to the flames (i.e. became a satī), while her husband was still alive. 

After the death of his mother Harṣa goes to his dying father and clasps his feet in dispair. The latter comforts him, recommends him to his royal duties, and utters his last words: ‘enemies should be exterminated’. 3 The body is brought to the bank of the Sarasvatī on a bier, a funeral pyre is built and the cremation ritual is performed at dusk. It is suggested that the remaining ladies of the king’s harem also commit satī. Harṣa keeps a vigil and next morning goes to the Sarasvatī to bathe, offers an oblation of water to his father, and goes home in distress (p. 293). A brahmin eats the first piṇḍas offered to the ghost (preta) and the period of impurity passes. 

The deceased king’s paraphernalia are given to the brahmins; the collected bones are brought to holy places. Then it is said that a ‘stab of pain’ is set up

in the form of a monument at (the place of) the funeral pyre made of a mass of bricks. 4 Finally the royal elephant is set loose and gradually the lamentations subside. The metaphor used by Bāṇa, ‘a stab of pain’ (śokaśalya)—the primary meaning of śalya being ‘dart’—suggests that the monument had the form of a needle. 5 Such a monument seems to be known from the Sanskrit literature, viz. the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa’s chapter on the so-called aiḍūka. 

The aiḍūka of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa 

Viṣṇudharmottara 3.84.1–15 describes the aiḍūkarūpa as follows. 6 A structure is built of three (receding) square platforms (bhadrapīṭha), with steps on four sides. On the third platform a liṅgarūpa is erected, but one not decorated with lines (rekhā, i.e. without the brahmasūtra and the pārśvasūtra). In the middle of this liṅgarūpa an immovable square column (yaṣṭi) is fixed. On that thirteen bhūmikās are made. 7 On top of this is an āmalasāraka (=āmalaka?) and on that again a round column, yaṣṭi, is fixed. This col umn is decorated with a medallion (candraka). 8 In between the bhūmikās and the liṅga (i.e. on the square column?) the four Lokapālas are situated, Virūḍha, Dhr̥tarāṣṭra, Virūpākṣa, and Kubera, with lances (śūla) in their hands, wear ing armour and ornaments. 9 It is said that in this construction Virūḍha is Sakra, Dhr ´ .tarāṣṭra is Yama, Virūpākṣa is Varuṇa, and Kubera is Rājarāja. This aiḍūka is named ‘Prajāhita’; men who worship it obtain happiness and heaven after death. 

Shah in her commentary emphasizes that this Aiḍūka structure is not a particular deity but is designed to embody the whole universe. As to the names of the Lokapālas she remarks: ‘These are known to Buddhist mythology as the four Buddhist Yakṣas who do the work of the Lokapālas.’ 10 Shah assumes that

7 It is unclear whereon exactly, the liṅgarūpa or the yaṣṭi; liṅgarūpa is neuter, yaṣṭi feminine. tasyopariṣṭāt (84.5c) refers to the liṅgarūpa, unless we assume double sandhi. A similar sloppy construction is seen in 6a. Shah cites Kramrish, who interprets the bhūmikās as ‘steps’. 

8 I read samārdhacandra◦ instead of samārkacandra◦, meaning that the medallion is situ ated in the middle of the horizontal (sama) crescent mooṇThe thirteen bhūmikās and the āmalasāraka are said to represent the 14 bhuvanas. The liṅga represents Maheśvara, the round column Pitāmaha and the square column Janārdana. The three platforms represent the three guṇas.

the aiḍūka of the VDhP is without ashes or bones and is therefore acceptable to be worshipped, whereas originally such monuments would have contained bones or relics. This plausible assumption as well as the naming of the four Buddhist Lokapālas strongly suggest that Buddhist examples lie at the root of the Purāṇa’s description of the aiḍūka.11 We may add that the use of the word aiḍūka, instead of eḍūka, could also point to this, meaning ‘derived from/related to/of the nature of the eḍūka’, not the original (Buddhist) ‘ossuary’. The view that sees in the aiḍūka an appropriation by the author of the VDhP of a Buddhist architectural tradition finds support in the outcome of Gustav Roth’s investigation into the Symbolism of the Buddhist Stūpa.12 

The eḍūka 

We have some more literary evidence regarding the eḍūka. The Mahāvastu refers to an anticipated funerary monument of Princess Sudarśanā, who tells her mother: 

Mother, when the seven Kṣatriyas, after fighting one another, shall have caused my death, then, after having performed the cremation rite and collected the bones, you should next erect for me a monument (elūkā). And at the entrance of that monument you should plant a karṇikāra tree. Thereupon, when the first month of the rainy season has come after the hot season, that karṇikāra tree will be wrapped in a golden colour as it is covered abundantly by blossoms. Then you shall remember me, thinking to yourself: ‘I had a daughter whose complexion was beautiful (sudarśanā) like this’. 13 

Lore, p. 212, is of the opinion that the names of the four world-guardians do not occur in the older Pāli texts, but they are given in the Mahāsamayasutta (D II, 257–258) and in the At ¯.ānāṭiyasutta (D III, 197 ff.) in accordance with their fixed distribution in the four directions. 

In the Aiḍūka construction it seems that Virūḍha represents the East (= Sakra) and ´ Dhr̥tarāṣṭra the South (= Yama). This would make a pradakṣiṇā: Virūḍha East, Dhr̥tarāṣṭra South, Virūpākṣa West, Kubera North. This is a deviation from the stand ard Buddhist doctrine; cf. Banerjea 1956, 521 f.: 

In Buddhist mythology too we find a group of four divine beings associated with the four principal quarters, and the Sanskrit Buddhist texts give us a stereotyped list of four; they are Dhr̥tarāṣṭra, the Gandharva king (east), Virūḍhaka, the king of the Kumbhāṇḍas (south), Virūpākṣa, the Nāga monarch (west) and Vaiśravaṇa, the Yakṣa king (north). They are the Catur-mahārājas of some Buddhist texts, and Pāṇini seems to have had them in his mind when he referred to their bhaktas in one of his sūtras (P 4.3.99): mahārājāṭṭhañ. 

11 If we compare this description with that of the Divyāvadāna (see below, n. 77 on p. 428) we observe another correspondence: the stairs at the four sides. The three bhadrapīṭhas may reflect the three medhīs or platforms (see Roth 1980, 200 f.). 

12 Roth 1980. In a Postscriptum Roth draws a comparison between the description in the VDhP and some Buddhist texts and refers, for instance, to a bronze stūpa (ca. 10th century) kept in the Patna Museum (Plate XIV/3; cf. op. cit. 208). Roth concludes that the VDhP ‘follows an older Buddhist tradition which is found in the above quoted chapters of Caityavibhāgavinayodbhāvasūtra, Stūpalakṣaṇakārikāvivecana, and Kriyā saṁgraha’ (op. cit. 200). 13 Mahāvastu II, p. 486 l 5: 









Evidently the word used here for the monument, elūkā, refers to a funerary monument of laymeṇEmeneau, discussing the word in a review of Mayrhofer’s kewa,14 and referring to Edgerton’s bhsd ṣv. eluka, remarks: 

The word in Buddhist texts seems clearly to be eluka or elūka and to mean ‘mon ument containing the ashes or bones of a dead person’. [. . . ] Considering the clear meaning in the Buddhist texts (bones are specifically mentioned in one pas sage) and the l of the word there, one must at least consider again Kittel’s old suggestion. . . of connection with the Dr[avidian] words for ‘bone’. . . . 

Shah quotes Helmer Smith who derives it from the Canarese root el.- ‘to stand up, to rise’. 15 This meaning of the word eḍūka is confirmed by the Amarakośa, in which it occurs in connection with ‘wall’: ‘An eḍūka is (a wall) wherein bones are placed, i.e. an ossuary.’ 16 

From the evidence surveyed above it seems to appear that the erection of funer ary monuments was not strictly limited to the heterodox traditions. However, being from its inception connected with the remains of the dead, the eḍūka

Kane IV, 255 n. 580 draws our attention to a passage in the Brahmanical literature where a tree and eḍūka are mentioned. It concerns a passage found in Aparārka’s commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti (vol. II, pp. 885 f.) ascribed to the Brahmapurāṇa: 

It is stated that the charred bones of a cremated person should be collected in an urn and deposited at the root of a tree or cast in the Ganges, that the place of cremation should be purified with cowdung and water, that a puṣkaraka tree should be planted there or an eḍūka (a structure) should be built over it.

15 Shah VDhP p. 173. She further speculates about the etymology and concludes: ‘If this is correct, it would lead us to the conclusion that the Deśya word eḍūka, which later on became sanskritised and accepted in sanskrit lexicons, originally must have meant a 

structure containing bone relics.’ (p. 172). Allchin 1957, 3 refers to Tamil √iṭu, meaning ‘bury’ since very early times and iṭu-kāṭu, ‘burial ground’. The same author refers to the ubiquitous stone cists found in Dravida country: ‘The stone cists have been found to contain almost every possible combination of relics including the collected bones of many persons.’. . . ‘The cist was sometimes built on the bare rock, or sometimes partly or entirely buried in a pit. Over and around it was placed a cairn of small stones, granite chips, etc. and around the cairn was frequently placed one or more circles of large boulders.’ (op. cit. 3); cf. Falk 2000, 73.

was, for obvious reasons, not much in vogue in orthodox circles, as the follow ing passage demonstrates. Mahābhārata 3.188 pretends to describe the period of total disruption at the end of the Kali Age, but, as is often the case with such passages, its hidden agenda seems to be to attack contemporaneous prac tices. 17 

And this perverted world shall be upside down: at the dissolution of the yuga (people) will venerate charnel-houses (eḍūkas) and abandon the gods, (whereas) śūdras will not serve the brahmins. When the yuga expires, the earth shall no longer be decorated by temples, but marked by charnel-houses (eḍūkas): in the hermitages of the great seers, in the settlements of brahmins, in the dwellings of the gods, in hallowed places (caitya), and in the abodes of the Nāgas. That is the sign that the yuga has come to an end. When men, fierce and devoid of dharma, will be constantly eating meat and drinking liquor, then the yuga will collapse. 18 

Although not popular with the orthodox, the custom of erecting a monument for the dead goes back to megalithic times and was partly sanctioned by Vedic literature. 19 Kane, dealing with funerary rites, observes (IV, 255): ‘It will be seen that the disposal of the dead in ancient India was divided into four stages, viz. cremation, collecting the charred bones and depositing them underground in an urn, expiatory rites (called Sāntikarma) and erection of a monument ´ over the bones. The last was not necessarily done in every case.’ Caland in his Die altindischen Todten- und Bestattungsgebräuche describes this optional procedure. On the ground where the cremation had taken place (śmaśāna) a plot of land of the size of a man is demarcated, square or, according to others, round. The land is ritually ploughed.

Despite the attention paid to these barrows (citi) in the Kalpaśāstra, we, pace Giuseppe de Marco, find little hard evidence that this Vedic tradition was continued in historic times in classical North India. Disposal of the remains in holy water (tīrtha)—be it the ashes/bones, or the body as a whole (as in the case of ascetics)—seems to have replaced the older practices of inhumation and exposure. 21 This tallies with the virtual absence in the Mahābhārata of any reference to the erection of monuments to the dead, apart from the quoted passage regarding the alleged worship of eḍūkas.22 

The Sanskrit literature knows, however, yet another type of monument to commemorate the deceased; it is said to appertain in particular to the kṣatriya class. 23 The Pratimānāṭaka, traditionally ascribed to Bhāsa, describes how Bharata on his return to Ayodhyā pauses at a building, outside the city, tucked away amidst the trees, on the walls of which sandal imprints of hands are found, of which the doors are decorated with floral wreaths, and where he finds offerings (bali), evident from flowers and parched rice grains that are well arranged, and a floor strewn with sand. 24 Little wonder that, when he also fails to see a dhvaja or other emblem of a god (cihna), Bharata is puzzled: could this be a ‘house of the gods’ (devakula)? Inside there are images, well made and true to life, which makes one believe that they are human beings. And this they 

20 Caland 1896; cf. Falk 2000, 75 ff. Saindon 2000. 

21 Cf. de Marco 1987, 219 ff. 

22 In an interesting study, Disposal of the Dead in the Mahābhārata, Tiwari 1979, 23 f. observes the following: 

It has already been remarked that the Mahābhārata seems to contain no clear refer ence to the rite of asthi-sañcayana, which formed an essential element of antyeṣṭi as described in several ritual texts. This rite involved the collection of charred bones and ashes some days after the cremation and disposal of them in various ways—hanging in a bundle on the branch of a tree, or recremating in some special cases, or depositing at the foot of a tree, or, more generally, burying them in a hole dug in the ground and sometimes also building some kind of memorial mound (śmaśāna) over them. Apparently this practice gradually went out of vogue, and, already towards the close of the epic, the custom of depositing the bones in holy river had probably become more common. 

23 The South-Indian Dīptāgama Paṭala 52, Kṣatriyasthāpana, gives a description of the installation of images of the king, his queen and the ministers (Dīptāgama II, 347–56). For the South-Indian tradition of royal portraiture see also Lef`evre 2006, Part 3 Ch. 8. See also below, n. 27 on p. 411.

prove to be. Bharata has come upon a statue gallery, pratimāgr̥ha, in which images of the deceased kings of the Ikṣvāku race are set up; his uncertainty seems to indicate that it is an uncommon phenomenon. 25 The keeper tells him that a brahmin should not salute or worship them as they do not represent gods (daivata), but kings (kṣatriya) who have passed away. When Bharata discovers an image of Daśaratha among them, he understands that his father has died. 26 

The problem with this testimony, however, is its date and place of origiṇThe issue has been discussed by many scholars, and Tieken 1993, summarizing much of this discussion, argues that the so-called ‘Trivandrum Plays’, to which the Pratimānāṭaka belongs, may be late and of South-Indian origin. 27 

The archaeology of the funerary monument 

If we turn to archaeology, it becomes immediately clear that, despite the lit erary evidence, material testifying to the actual practice of erecting funerary monuments in the Brahminical tradition in ancient India is rare. 28 A. Ghosh 

25 Pratimānāṭaka 3.6. 

26 Pratimānāṭaka 3.7–9. 

27 On account of a formal statistical analysis, van der Geer 1998 dates this particular play to the 4th or 5th century ad (op. cit. 177) and also thinks a South Indian author most likely (op. cit. 187). The Pratimānāṭaka may reflect a South-Indian custom. That South-Indian funerary practices differed from the ‘Aryan’ North may also be deduced from the description of a cemetery in the early Tamil epic Maṇimekalai (Dani´elou 1989, 24 ff.). The practice to install commemorative images of Sivabhaktas is prescribed in the ´ relatively late South-Indian redaction of the Ajitāgama, not known to (12th-century) Aghoraśiva (Goodall 2004, cx), which text tells us that this sort of images may be installed at holy places or in a Siva temple where they should be worshipped. According ´ to Dīptāgama 52.59 images of bhaktas should follow the rules of the images of the king (above, n. 23 on p. 410). The Ajitāgama gives the following description 63.39–42: 

śivālaye viśeṣeṇa śivabhaktān kr̥tāñjalīn k 39 k savālacāmarakarāṁl liṅgahastān sa lakṣaṇān | bimbarūpān vidhāyātha mahāmaṇṭapadeśataḥk 40 k maṇimaṇṭapadeśe vā prākārābhyantareṣu vā | tasmāt sarvaprayatnena pratiṣṭhāpya yathāvidhi k 41 k śivāgamavidhānena nityapūjāṁsamācaret | pratiṣṭhānāṁbhaktānām ālaye bimba rūpiṇāṁk 42 k nityaṁnaimittikaṁkāmyam utsavaṁca samācaret | 

The editor of the Ajitāgama, ṇR̥Bhatt, quotes the Acintya- and refers to the Uttara kāmikāgama ad loc. The underlying idea seems to be that these bhaktas have reached sārūpya with Siva and can therefore be depicted with four arms, though they keep the ´ distinct (iconographic) characteristics of the devotee: two hands forming an añjali, as a true devotee should, two others holding liṅga and chowry. 

Along with this South Indian custom one may consider funerary practices in Indianized Southeast Asia. Thus there is substantial evidence that in Cambodia as well as on Java and Bali temples and statues were erected for deceased kings and their families; see i.a. Cœd`es 1940, 320 ff. (I thank Arlo Griffiths for this reference). 

28 Cf. Malamoud 1982, 442: 

Or, la suppression physique du cadavre s’accompagne de proc´edures qui aboutissent `a l’abolition du souvenir de la personne du mort. Notons d’abord qu’apr`es la dispersion des restes du d´efunt nul tombeau, bien sˆur, mais aussi nul c´enotaphe n’est mis en place qui pourrait prolonger son existence terrestre en lui r´eservant un morceau d’espace. 









observes the following: ‘As by the time cremation had virtually replaced inhu mation there is hardly any archaeological evidence of the practices concerning the disposal of the dead. [The Buddhist (and Jaina) stūpas form an entirely different category.]’ 29 From the following it will emerge that this sweeping statement should be qualified on two points: the Buddhist and Jain customs are not so categorically different from the Hindu ones (see p. 425), and there is more archaeological evidence of Hindu funerary practice than supposed by Ghosh (see below, p. 430). 

In discussions regarding this apparent absence reference is often made to excavations at Lauriya–Nandangarh (W. Champaran District, Bihar), 30 which, since ṬBloch’s excavations in 1905, 31 are supposed to show ‘Vedic burial mounds’. Ghosh assesses the evidence unearthed by Bloch, refers to the re examination by ṇG. Majumdar, 32 whose excavation he himself continued after the demise of Majumdar, and concludes: 

He (i.e. Majumdar) found that all of them were earthen burial memorials with burnt-brick revetment, two being faced with a brick lining in a double tier, so that there was no justification for regarding them as more earthen barrows. He also pointed out that the gold leaves found by Bloch [containing a female figure in frontal pose] had their exact replica in the stūpa at Piprawa, which is definitely a Buddhist stūpa of 300 bc or earlier. The respective Lauriya stūpas might be of a comparable date and there is nothing to connect them with Vedic burial rites. 33 

Nevertheless, the question is justified whether cremation completely replaced inhumatioṇIt certainly did not for certain categories of persons such as chil dren, yogins or ascetics (yati), and pregnant women. 34 The evidence of eighteen Gandhāra reliefs containing depictions of cemeteries and burial monuments dis cussed by de Marco 1987 seems to indicate that burial was still customary long after the Vedic period at least in certain parts of India and for certain categories of persons. We shall come back to this below (p. 424 ff.). 

In order to improve our understanding of the phenomenon of memorials to the dead it might be useful to distinguish between categories of monuments. 1 Temples dedicated to a particular god, erected in order to transfer the merit thereof to the deceased, often recorded in epigraphs. Many temples may actu ally fall into this category, for which there is, to the best of my knowledge, no

As to the burial of pregnant women he concludes (op. cit. 222, n. 59): ‘Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the practice of burial for deceased pregnant women, even if not explicitly traceable in the texts, has always been considered, from an unspecifiable epoch, as both necessary and legitimate.’ Cf. Kane IV, 227–233.

specific Sanskrit word, but which in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription is referred to with the generic term prāsāda.35 A special relation between the god and the deceased indicates that this type of buildings has a commemora tive function, at least for contemporaries, and I therefore propose to refer to this type of monuments as ‘memorials’. 

2 Sanctuaries/buildings that contain an image/images of the deceased. They are known in Sanskrit as pratimāgr̥ha, or ‘statue galleries’. 

3 Hero-stones, including satī-stones, which are found in particular in the Dec can in great number, and which commemorate the place where a heroic death took place. They could be classified as ‘memorial stones’. 

4 Structures that have some formal correspondences with the funerary mon uments of the following category (5), but which do not contain the actual mortuary remains; these seem to have been described in the Viṣṇudharmo ttarapurāṇa under the name of aiḍūka. 5 Burial mounds or sepulchral monuments that actually contain the ashes and/or bones, or the bodies of the deceased, in Sanskrit literature referred to as eḍūka. 

Memorials 

This category may be illustrated by two examples, the first one being the Vākāṭaka temples on the top of the Rāmagiri, the other a temple built by Skandagupta for his father Kumāragupta in Bhitarī. 36 

As I have argued elsewhere (Bakker 1992b and 1997, 30 f.), the 5th-century Vākāṭaka temples on the Rāmagiri were erected to transfer merit to the dead. The choice of the temple-deity was not arbitrary; it was made on the basis of an envisaged similarity or affinity of the god and the deceased queen and kings (Bakker 1992b). This theory builds on the evidence of the inscription found in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple on the Rāmagiri, in which Prabhāvatī’s daugh ter, Princess Atibhāvatī, widow of Ghaṭotkacagupta, records the good works she has done. The text is very fragmentary and problematic. A translation of the relevant passage may run as follows. 

Then (the princess) commissioned the splendid ‘Master of Prabhāvatī’, (the image of the) Lord of the World, within the temple, for the sake of undecaying merit of 

35 Above, p. 125; Bakker 1997, 167. Granoff 1992, 187 refers to a temple built after the cre mation of the Jain minister Vastupāla on Mt Satruñjaya called ‘Svargārohanaprāsāda’. ´ Granoff 1992 (passim) proves that the building of memorial temples was just as pop ular in Jainism as it was in Hinduism. This type of memorial temple seems to be referred to under the Cōḷas as paḷḷi-paṭai in Tamil: ‘temple erected in memory of kings’. Huntington 1985, 310 conjectures that the famous Dharmarāja shrine in Māmallapuram may have been such a paḷḷi-paṭai, since it contains a portrait image of the Pallava king Nr̥siṁhavarman I himself on its southern face. 

36 The wide-spread practice to install liṅgas in commemoration of the deceased, which could be comprised in the category of ‘memorial’, is left out of account here. An example hereof is e.g. attested by the Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61, above, p. 287, below, p. 494. For this practice in Nepal, centering around Paśupatinātha, see Mirnig 2016. 









(her) mother. (21) . . . [text lost] 

After she of extreme hlustrei (Atibhāvatī), had made in the village Kadalīvāṭaka a water reservoir Sudarśana (‘lovely to behold’) and (installed) the beautiful (su darśana) god, . . . for the sake of merit (24, 25) . . . [text lost]

On account of this evidence we assume that either the Kevala–Narasiṁha Tem ple, in which the inscription is found to date, or the adjacent Trivikrama Tem ple, to which the inscription originally may have belonged, 38 had been erected around the middle of the 5th century to transfer merit to the Vākāṭaka queen Prabhāvatī Guptā, who may have died a little earlier. This queen took great pride in her descent from two famous families, her father being the Gupta em peror Candragupta II, her mother Kuberanāgā born in the Nāga House and belonging to the Dhāraṇa gotra (Bakker 1997, 12). It may therefore not be coincidence that in front of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple entrance an image of a serpent, Nāga, is found. We will come back to this below, (p. 434). 

A reference to another specimen of a memorial temple erected to transfer merit to a deceased king can be found in the Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta.39 The inscription of Prabhāvatī’s nephew, Skandagupta, is not without difficulties. The temple to which it may refer has been excavated, 40 but the image installed has not been found. Though somewhat elliptical, verse 12 may be read as follows. 

Hence the manifestation of the Lord (Bhagavat), this (image/manifestation) here (i.e. Kumārasvāmin) and that which here has been consigned (to it) (i.e. the grāma), he (i.e. Skandagupta) has destined both for the merit of (his) father, since he is determined upon merit. 41 

The inscription tells us that Skandagupta installed an image, probably of Vāsudeva and possibly named Kumārasvāmin, 42 a deity who is said in verse 10 to be a great archer, Sārṅgin, and as such reflects the qualities of the emperor ´

and his father. In verse 8, in which his victory over the Hūṇas is reported, the twanging sound of a bow (śārṅgadhvanih.) is referred to in a simile that seems to express Skandagupta’s prowess. For the maintenance of the image/temple Skandagupta assigned a community/village (grāma) to the deity, that is to say, he exempted this community from taxes, so that its surplus production could be used for worship and maintenance. Both beneficial acts were performed to increase the merit of the deceased father, Kumāragupta. 

Pratimāgr̥has 

When searching for galleries where effigies of kings were installed, the pra timāgr̥ha, our second category, two sites spring to mind: Māṭnear Mathurā, and a cave at Nāṇeghāt., a pass leading from the Konkan to Junnar (Pune Dist.). The latter site has been discussed by Ajay Mitra Shastri. In this cave two sets of inscriptions are found: 43 

One of them, a large but fragmentary one is inscribed partly on the left and partly on the right walls. On its [i.e., the cave’s] back wall were put up statues of eight personages which have all disappeared almost completely and over their heads there were inscribed what may be called labels of which also only six are now extant enabling us to identify the figures originally carved below them. Going by the preserved labels there were installed statues of Simuka Sātavāhana, the founder of the dynasty, queen Nāganikā and her spouse king Sātakani (Sātakarṇi), Kumāra (prince) Bhāya, Mahāraṭhi Tranakayira, Kumāra Hakusiri and kumāra Sātavāhana. 44 

According to Shastri the gallery was initiated by King Kr̥ṣṇa, who set up the image of his elder brother Simuka, and continued by Vediśrī, who set up the images of his father and mother Sātakarṇi and Nāganikā. Shastri argues, on the basis of the Pratimānāṭaka, that all images were erected after the death of the person involved. If his identification of these early Sātavāhana kings is correct, it would mean that this pratimāgr̥ha predates the one at Māṭand therefore cannot have been inspired by the Kuṣāṇa example. The epigraphs found in Nāṇeghāṭdo not give any reason to believe that these images were worshipped. The long inscription enumerates many Vedic sacrifices and their dakṣiṇās, but is silent as to the images. 

The situation seems different at Māt.. The archaeological remains of a build ing and the inscribed images of the Kuṣāṇa kings Vima/Vema (Kadphises), Kaniṣka, Huviṣka (?) and others, belong to the most well-known India has produced. The epigraphs have been competently dealt with by Lüders (posthu mously published by Janert 1961). The building that housed these images is referred to as devakula in the inscriptions themselves. About this Lüders re marks: 

43 For these inscriptions see also Sircar SI I, 190–197. 

44 Shastri 1998, 102. Cf. Verardi 1983, 244–50. 







There can be little doubt that the devakula at the Māṭsite, similarly to ‘Bhāsa’s’ devakula, served chiefly as a hall for the statues of members of the royal Kuṣāṇfamily, although, as proved by the life-size image found together with the Kaniṣka statue, images of gods were mixed up with them. 45 

The latter concessive clause may mark a significant difference with the situation in Nāṇeghāṭand the depiction in the Pratimānāṭaka. It may account for the term devakula used in the Māṭinscriptions. ‘Bhāsa’ speaks also about a devakula, but that word is used when Bharata does not yet know whether he has to do with a ‘house of the gods’ or not. When he discovers the true nature of the monument the text uses the word pratimāgr̥ha.46 Another important difference may be related to this. Lüders remarks, 

In one respect, however, the collection of the Kuṣāṇstatues seems to have differed from the gallery described in the Pratimānāṭaka. Bhāsa tells us that only deceased kings were honoured by setting up their images. This restriction does not seem to have prevailed in the case of the Kuṣāṇdevakula. The present inscription was engraved on the pedestal of a statue, and we may reasonably assume that, in addition to the repair of the devakula, the gift of the statue was recorded in the inscriptioṇThe statue cannot have represented the grandfather of Huviṣka, nor is it likely that it was the second image of Kaniṣka. As the donation was made for the increase of the life and strength of Huviṣka, it becomes very probable that it represented that king, but that benedictory phrase shows at the same time that the statue was set up during the lifetime of Huviṣka. 47 

From this combined evidence it may appear that the images of the Kuṣāṇa kings were worshipped like those of gods, even when still alive. The true nature of the devakula was the subject of an interesting essay by G´erard Fussman, who compared the Māṭsanctuary with a similar one in Surkh-Kotal, also containing images of Kuṣāṇa kings. 48 He argues that we should conceive of these temples as ‘shrines where the king, his family and high officials worshipped the deity who protects the king and his family, not the temple of the godlike king’. 49 A devakula is, according to the French scholar, ‘a royal family shrine’. 50 This

47 Lüders 1961, 144 f. 

48 Fussman 1989; cf. Rosenfield 1993, 154–172. Shastri 1998, 109 refers to similar ‘small sanctuaries in the Swāt region of Afghanistan’. 

49 Fussman 1989, 199. 

50 Fussman 1989, 198. Cf. Frantz Grenet 2015, 209 f. discussing the Rabatak Temple and its inscription: 

The temple is said to contain images of Kani˘ska’s three direct ancestors and prede cessors (Kujula Kadphises, Vima Taktu, Vima Kadphises), and of himself: as in the Surkh Kotal temple, and also at Māṭin Mathura, another royal foundation, the royal statues are commemorative and not in themselves an object of worship (despite the enduring theory of the Kushan dynastic cult). In the Rabatak inscription gods, clearly distinguished from deceased kings, are mentioned in two contexts. 







21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 417 

connotation accords well with the use of the term in the Vākāṭaka inscriptions, in which the state sanctuaries are referred to as ‘places’ (sthāna) of the devakula (above, p. 332). However, the idea of installing in these sanctuaries life-size images of the royal family itself is clearly imported into North India. Fussman’s contention that these royal images were not meant for worship in their own right remains open to doubt; the word devakula may have been used precisely because the Kuṣāṇa kings thought of themselves, or wanted their subjects to believe that they were members of the divine family (kula). 51 Their title, devaputra, also seems to endorse this. 52 Apparently the Brahmanical tradition represented by ‘Bhāsa’ found this too much to swallow, in view of the shift from devakula to pratimāgr̥ha, and, to judge by our archaeological evidence, the idea of a statue gallery as a whole became obsolete, at least in North India during the period under review. 53 

Memorial stones 

The third category, ‘hero-stones’, has been the subject of a seminar at Dhar wad, the papers of which have been edited by ṢSettar & Günther d. Sont heimer (1982). In this volume ḌR̥Patil studies The Origin of Memorial Stones. Patil (op. cit. 48) observes that ‘. . . a memorial stone, in its basic conception, is commemorative in character, raised in memory or honour of the dead, and did not form part of the actual practice of the disposal of the dead’. Nevertheless Patil traces its origin back to this very practice by referring to early Buddhist monuments containing mortuary deposits, because in some of them a wooden post was found (Lauriya-Nandangarh), whereas an inscription in another Buddhist monument (Sui Vihar) seems to refer to such a post as a yaṣṭi raised in honour of the deceased (see below, p. 426). Typical of this type of stones seems to be that they contain a visual representation or symbol referring to the fate of those commemorated, in addition to, occasionally, a brief text. 

Early specimens of ‘memorial stones’ as defined above seem to have been the so-called chāyāstambha or chāyāskambha (‘shade-pillar’) from Nāgārjunakoṇḍa 

51 Von Hinüber 2004, 172 n. 234. Rosenfield 1993, 202 thinks that Iran is the most likely source of the tendency to deify the Kuṣāṇa kings. The term devakula literary means the ‘family seat of the god(s)’. When one installs a life-size image of oneself in this ‘seat’, does that not suggest that one wants to be regarded as part of that family? 

52 Cf. Rosenfield 1993, 202 ff. Differently Grenet 2015, 209 n. 27: 

The Kushan royal title ‘son of the god(s)/son of the lord(s)’, Bactr̥bagopouro, Indian devaputra, are no more real proof of a claim to divine filiation as theopatōr on some Arsacid coins, probably corresponding to a genuine Parthian word *bagpuhr. It can just as well allude to the legitimate royal filiation, eventually to the divine election. 

A critical examination of this difficult issue is found in Verardi 1983. 

53 Cf. above, n. 27 on p. 411. Granoff 1992, 190 reports that ‘. . . images of tīrthaṅkaras were often made for the welfare of the dead. Bharata’s funerary monument to his father also bears striking resemblances to actual funerary monuments for Jain monks in having a portrait image of the deceased. . . ’ See also below, n. 72 on p. 425. Von Hinüber 2004, 172 refers to the inscribed portrait images of Pallava kings and queens (7th century ad) in South India (see above, n. 35 on p. 413; Huntington 1985, 310; Lef`evre 2006). 









discussed by ḤSarkar in the same volume. 54 These pillars were raised during the rule of the Ikṣvākus in the third century ad. They commemorate the death of members of the ruling class, religious personages and soldiers. One may serve as an example. King Rudrapuruṣadatta erected in the 11th year of his reign a memorial stone (chāyakaṁbha) for his mother, Mahādevī Varmabhaṭā (Vaṁmabhaṭā) belonging to the Bahaphala (i.e. Br̥hatphalāyana) gotra, who was the daughter of the Mahākṣatrapa, probably a Saka king from Ujjain. ´ 55 The pillar on which the inscription is found is decorated by one panel depicting the queeṇThe queen ‘is seated on a stool [and] holding a mirror in her hand. She is dressed like a foreign lady, accompanied by two female attendants’. 56 Sircar (op. cit. 20) argues that the word chāyā in this context means ‘image’, and thus refers to the portrait of the deceased queen above the inscription. 57 Most chāyāstambhas belong to a Buddhist milieu, but this pillar seems to be the only one that ‘was found in the precincts of a Buddhist monastery’ (Sarkar op. cit. 202). 58 

The Saka connection is reinforced by a find in Paunī, a Sātavāhana site in the ´ Bhandara District of Maharashtra. The inscription on a memorial pillar (chāyā khaṁbha) mentions a prince (kumāra) Rupiaṁma of the Mahākṣatrapa. 59 Shas tri (1998, 66) does not believe that Rupiaṁma actually ruled over Vidarbha, as does Mirashi, but surmises that ‘he might have come over there as a pilgrim as Paunī was an important religious centre, especially for the Buddhists. . . ’. In view of this evidence, Sarkar (1982, 205) tentatively suggests that the memorial in this form, i.e. our third category, may have originated in and spread from the area under Saka rule in the first centuries of the Christian era. ´ 

54 Sarkar 1982, 199–207. 

55 Sircar in EI XXXIV, 21. 

56 Sarkar 1982, 202. Cf. Sircar in EI XXXIV, 21: ‘She has a head-dress; but her locks are not tied in a knot. She wears an upper garment covering her bust and a long scarf covers her right shoulder and upper right arm and also her left forearm. The queen appeared to be dressed like a foreign lady which she really was. . . ’. 

57 For an illustration see Fig. 1 of Sarkar’s contribution to Settar & Sontheimer 1982. The usage of the word chāyā in this funerary context has a close parallel in the related Greek         , (‘shade’). For chāyā meaning ‘portrait’ see Granoff 2001, 68 n. 10. 

58 Another, somewhat later (5th century?), specimen of a memorial stone with portrait has been found in Sangsi (Kolhapur District). It depicts a funeral scene showing the figure of the queen and attendants. The inscription on it reports the erection of a stone funerary monument (śailaṁcaityakam) (i.e. the slab of stone itself, referred to by idam) by her loving husband, King Pu. . . , in order to protect/preserve (her) merits/virtues.

It is indeed in the Saka territories that we find corroborative evidence for ´ this hypothesis. It has the form of six ‘long narrow slabs of stone’ that were discovered ‘standing as monuments on a hillock’ at the village Andhau on the Rann of Cutch (Gujarat). 60 These stones had been erected in the (Saka) ´ year 52, i.e. ad 130, under the rule of Rāja Rudradāman, who is none other than the Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman I. 61 Four stones still carry inscriptions, one of which records that the inscribed slab of stone, referred to as laṣṭi (= yaṣṭi) in the inscription itself, had been erected (uthāpita), by Madana for his sister Jeṣṭhavīrā belonging to the Opaśati (Aupaśatika) gotra. This Madana erected in the same year similar monuments for his brother R. ṣabhadeva and his wife Yaśodattā, who is called a novice nun (śrāmaṇerī). Patil and Sarkar (op. cit. 54 f., 204 ff.) discuss a number of similar pillars, all of them from ar eas ‘where the Sakas were ruling’, and Patil concludes that they are ‘funerary ´ monuments. . . presumably intended to commemorate the dead’. 62 We have no indications that the memorial stones (yaṣṭis), such as found in Andhau, marked the spot where mortuary remains were deposited, although this may be decep tive, since the sites have not been subject to archaeological scrutiny. 63 If this is correct, however, and there are no deposits, we are here concerned with fu nerary monuments that may be thought of as forerunners of the ‘hero-stones’ (category 3), not yet carrying a picture; strictly speaking, they should be clas sified in our fourth category: funerary monuments without mortuary deposits. On the other hand, although the term yaṣṭi is used to refer to these steles, these monuments differ widely from the constructions composed of square and circular yaṣṭis as described under the heading aiḍūka in the VDhP. 

Aiḍūkas 

Ahicchatra 

There exists a brick monument that has been thought to conform to and has been identified as an aiḍūka in the sense of the VDhP. This is the ‘Siva temple’ ´ at Ahicchatra (AC I), which is, in the words of Agrawala (Plate 85): 

A massive brick structure unique of its kind in North India. On plan it is similar to the quadrangular Buddhist stūpas raised in several tiers, diminishing upwards like a gigantic staircase. The structure answers closely to what the Viṣṇudharmo ttarapurāṇa describes as an eḍūka (sic) built in three terraces (bhadra-pīṭhas), one above the other, with four stepped approaches and surmounted on the top by 

60 EI XVI (1921-22), 19 ff. 

61 Shastri 1998, 156 f. 

62 Perhaps the stone slab with inscription, in which a Kosala king called Dhana(deva) is said to have erected a ketana for his father Phalgudeva, falls within the same category, as suggested by Shastri 1998, 108 (see Bakker 1986 I, 21 n. 5). 

63 The Central-Asian tribes of the Alta¨ı Mountains, variously known as Scyths or Sakas ´ and related to the Indian Sakas, are known for their extraordinary burial practices. ´ Reference may be made to the burial mounds, or ‘kurgan’, found in Pazyryk (Korolkova 2017; cf. Het Rijk der Scythen, 74 ff.). 









a Siva-liṅga. The monument, still having a colossal ´ Siva-liṅga on its top, must ´ therefore be identified as an eḍūka dedicated to Siva. ´ 64 

  



Plate 85 

Ahicchatra (AC I) during excavation (1940–44) 

The identification of this structure as an eḍūka or aiḍūka, is open to doubt. Within the structure in AC I a few terracotta sculptured panels were found with depictions of Saiva mythology, such as Gan ´ . as destroying Dakṣa’s sacrifice (No. 298), a ‘Bhairava’ figure (No. 300), and the so-called ‘Dakṣiṇāmūrti’ of Siva (No. 302b; below, Plate 149), which are supposed to have decorated ‘a ´ frieze running round its upper terrace’. 65 The aiḍūka of the VDhP, on the 

64 V.ṢAgrawala in Ancient India 4 (1947–48), 167. This identification has been taken over by several authors, among whom Shah in the ‘critical notes’ to her edition of the Third Khaṇḍa of the VDhP (1994), I p. 405. 

65 Agrawala 1947–48, 167. 





21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 421 

other hand, is explicitly not a temple and not dedicated to one god in partic ular. Moreover, there seem to be more terraces than the three bhadrapīṭhas of the VDhP, whereas there is apparently not a trace of the four Lokapālas, the thirteen bhūmikās, the āmalasāraka, and, worst, the square and circular yaṣṭis seem to be missing. A note of caution is in place here. I have not visited the site myself and base my assessment on the excavation reports. The ‘colossal Siva-liṅga’ originally may have been enshrined, as foundation walls found atop ´ the uppermost terrace seem to indicate. In view of these incongruities and uncertainties the structure crowning mound AC I and a similar one at mound AC II may therefore have been more adequately characterized by A. Ghosh who describes them as: 

Terraced temples of brick, each terrace made on foundation cells round a square frame, filled with earth. Both of them underwent many restorations and exten sions resulting in the increase of their dimensioṇThe larger of them [i.e. AC I] was founded on a layer with typical Stratum IV (Kushan) pottery and could not therefore have been founded before the early Gupta age. 66 

On the other hand, the mass of bricks ordered in a pyramidal, i.e. tapering framework, ending in a column or liṅga has an outward similarity with the structure described in the VDhP. It could be that Bāṇa (above, n. 4 on p. 406), describing the ‘funerary monument’ (citācaitya) of King Prabhākaravardhana in Thanesar as a ‘mass of bricks’ (sudhānicaya) resembling the form of a dart or needle (śalya), was thinking of a monument similar to the one uncovered in Ahicchatra, 300 km to the southeast of Thanesar, 150 km north of Kanauj. According to Bāṇa the ashes and bones (kīkasa) had been sent off for dispersal in holy places (tīrthasthāna), and this too would conform to the description of the aiḍūka in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, which does not mention nor refers to mortuary deposits. As far as one can tell—the description of this monument in the excavation report being very brief indeed—this would agree with the archaeological state of affairs in AC I, where no mortuary deposits have been reported. 67 

Mansar 

‘Unique’ as the structure may have appeared to the excavators at the time, I would like to draw attention to a recent excavation that has surprisingly much 

66 Ghosh in EIA II, 7. Cf. Shrimali 1983 I, 149: ‘Even if it was an eḍūka, the existing structure could not be identified with that of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa. The nucleus of the structure appears to be pre-Gupta—even the sizes of the bricks used are those, which were popular in the period between c. 100 bc and c. ad 300.’ 

67 Ahicchatra has most recently been investigated by Laxshmi Greaves (2015). She con cludes (p. 219): 

Neither the shaft at the heart of the monument, nor the foundations of AC I have been fully excavated so we cannot be entirely sure that no mortuary remains exist. Nevertheless, without further evidence being brought to light, we cannot designate AC I at Ahichhatra an aiḍūka with any confidence. 









in common with the Ahicchatra one. These are the excavations at Mansar: MNS 3 (Plate 86). The brick structure uncovered at a mound there, the so called Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī, has been interpreted by the excavators, who failed to refer to Ahicchatra, as a mixture of Hindu temples and Buddhist stūpas. 

Elsewhere I have shown the untenability of this conflation (Bakker 2004a). As in Ahicchatra, the Mansar mound shows a series of terraces built of brick, constructed over and against a natural hillock, which makes the whole thing look like a pyramid of brick. As in Ahicchatra, the various platforms are constructed over brick boxes filled with rubble, earth and stones, a construction device also know from stūpa domes. The mistake the Mansar excavators have made is that they have confounded similarity with identity. Mansar, like Ahi cchatra, is definitively a Saiva sanctuary, identities corroborated at both sites ´ by beautiful 5th-century Saiva sculptures, of terracotta in Ahicchatra, of red ´ sandstone in Mansar. Are we to classify the Mansar structure as an aiḍūka? 

  



Plate 86 

Mansar (MNS 3) 

The same reasons that speak against such an identification in Ahicchatra also apply to Mansar, but the Mansar site is characterized by some intriguing fea tures of its own. 

One of these is ‘the figure of a Puruṣa made of lime’ (Plate 87). 68 This figure is truly out of the ordinary and various interpretations are possible. In Bakker 2007b and 2009a (below, p. 458) I have made a case for seeing this Man 

68 Joshi & Sharma 1999-2000, 128. Cf. Bakker 2004a, 81. 







21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 423 

of Mansar as part of a construction sacrifice, in which the clay man replaced a human victim. The excavators report that ‘a vedi in the chest portion with a hole for fixing a yaṣṭi over it was made [below, Plate 105], and an earthen lamp was found nearby’. 69 Two pots have also been found near the knee of the Puruṣa, but we do not know what they may have contained. Could they have been filled with ashes? Near the figure’s left foot a small iron image of a snake was found (Plate 104). 

In addition, though not mentioned in the excavation report, during my stay at the site (1999) some bones were said to have been recovered from one of the two natural caves in the rock at the northern side of the hill. In the excavation report these caves are identified as a ‘shrine’ and ‘meditation chamber’ (ibid. 129); due to lack of any further information, it is impossible to say with what sort of bones we are concerned and to which period they may have belonged. Anyway, there seems to be no intrinsic connection with the brick monument on top of the mound. 

  



Plate 87 

MNS 3: ‘The Man of Mansar’ 

69 Joshi & Sharma 1999-2000, 128. Cf. Bakker 2004a, 81. The Puruṣa lies with his head towards the west or southwest; his trunk is partly twisted and his knees are bent. This posture seems to resemble that of some of the skeletons found in Ujjain, especially ‘skeletons Nos. 14 & 38’ depicted in Plates VIIIc and IXa (AAR 1938–39, p. 16); see below, n. 82 on p. 430 and Plate 127. 









Despite the Puruṣa, the urns, the hole to fix a yaṣṭi (here meaning ‘sacrificial post’ or yūpa), the alleged bones, and the terraced, pyramidal structure, I would be very reluctant to speak of this temple complex, referred to in inscriptions and seals as ‘Pravareśvara’ (above, p. 373, Plate 75) and called a devakulasthāna, in terms of an aiḍūka, or eḍūka for that matter. 

For the time being our conclusion should be that so-far there have not been discovered in the Hindu sphere structures that conform, more than superficially, to the description of the aiḍūka in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa. 

Funerary monuments with mortuary deposits 

It remains to discuss the funerary monuments in which actual mortuary de posits have been found, the eḍūka, our fifth category. 

As has been briefly noted above, Giuseppe de Marco brings together in an interesting article eighteen Gandhāra reliefs in which we find depictions of funerary monuments. Fifteen of them relate to the Buddhist legend of Sudāya, known form the Chinese canon. 70 

The story is briefly given by Zwalf in his catalogue of Gandhāra Sculpture in the British Museum (I, p. 202, ad 225 = below, Plate 88): 

A king of Candravatī (?), his mind poisoned by the jealousy of his other wives, caused his pregnant youngest wife to be killed and buried. A posthumous son [name restored as Sudāya], however, nourished himself from one breast on a half of his mother’s corpse not decomposed; when he was three the collapse of part of the tomb released him, and when he was six he met the Buddha and became an arhat. 

The reliefs depict Sudāya in the tomb   

at his mother’s side and his meeting 

of the Buddha. The representations 

of the tombs themselves, though pre 

served in a Buddhist context, have 

nothing intrinsically Buddhist about 

them; they may be based on contem 

poraneous examples of funerary mon 

uments in Gandhāra belonging to no 

religious persuasion in particular, but 

which served the artist to illustrate a 

Buddhist legend. The reliefs testify 

to the fact that, at least in Gandhāra 

Plate 88 

Kāfir-kot. (Gandhāra) Sudāya meets the Buddha 

and at least in the first centuries of the Christian era, a pregnant woman, and one who had met a violent death to boot, was not always cremated.

21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 425 

The funerary monuments shown on the reliefs are divided by de Marco into four types. The most common one (de Marco: type 1) is described as a (closed) ‘tumulus’ made of bricks. De Marco does not explicitly link this type with the (loṣṭa)citi, but it would seem to me that the burial mound made of bricks, known from the Kalpaśāstra, may be considered as its prototype. The other common type (de Marco: type 3) is described as a ‘hut’, ‘vihāra’, or ‘caityagr̥ha’. De Marco (op. cit. 232) observes: ‘It is difficult to determine why the funerary monuments displayed on these reliefs are this shape.’ It appears to me that some influence from outside the Indian world could be considered as a possible explanation: the sarcophagus or stone coffin, moulded according to the sim pliest form of a ‘dwelling’ in the Indian artistic idiom, the kuṭi or ‘hut’—the heavy, arched cover of the sarcophagus being interpreted as the ‘attic story’ or vault above a cubical chamber. 71 However, apart from these reliefs, no archae ological attestation of either of these two types is known to me. The question seems justified whether we are here concerned with a real historic phenomenon or an artistic convention. 

The above two types of tombs are particularly appropriate to burial of the body. This is less obviously the case in the two remaining types (de Marco’s types 2 and 4), which consist each of one specimen only (A-2 and B-10). In one of these instances (B-10), the subject of the Sudāya legend requires the depiction of a corpse, but the monument seems incongruous (below, p. 436 and Plate 94). The other specimen (A-2), illustrating the śmaśāna, does not show a corpse at all. We shall treat these two in more detail below, when we deal with what still remains to be discussed: funerary monuments connected with the remains of cremation, i.e. ashes. It will appear that, if conceived in this way, a link of these two types with other archaeological evidence can be made. 

Since we are particularly concerned with monuments in the Hindu sphere, we will not dwell upon the Buddhist stūpas at great length. 72 But, since the Buddhist cult of the stūpa developed out of more general South-Asian practices 

71 See Foekema 2003, 11. Zwalf (op. cit. I, 202) describes the tomb on the relief (Plate 88) kept in the British Museum (No. 225 = de Marco’s B-2) as: ‘The hut is a cubic structure with a high arched roof covered with a leaf pattern and surmounted horizontally along its ridge by a hemi-cylindrical element supporting a large bird; it seems double-roofed like the structures underlying the false gable panel but with the upper part unusually small.’ 

72 Jaina stūpas are left out of account altogether. Jaina texts refer to stūpas and ‘stūpa worship has been depicted in a number of sculptures. . . Actual Jaina stūpas were very few, but the most important of them was that of Mathurā at Ka˙nkālī T.īlā’ (Joshi 1989a, 333). For this stūpa and its interpretation see also Folkert 1989. Phyllis Granoff, asked about this subject, kindly wrote to me the following (email 22-5-05): 

In the Jain stories there is no relic worship. The gods take the relics to heaven and worship them there [cf. Granoff 1992, 189; Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra I, 364]. In the medieval period stūpas are regularly built for monks and images of the monks are made. They are both worshipped. The story about the first Jain images is that they are funerary images, but the accounts are pretty late [e.g. Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra I, 365–370]. It is a very interesting topic. There are also the memorials constructed where Jain monks fasted to death. 







of mortuary ritual and disposal of the dead, and the Brahmanical or Hindu tradition evolved from the same breeding ground, it may be informative to begin with an example from the Buddhist fold, the interesting case of the Sui Vihar stūpa in Bahawalpur (Pakistan). 

Sui Vihar 

In the remains of this stūpa a copperplate inscription has been found, dated in the 11th year of the reign of Kaniṣka, i.e. ad 138. The inscription attests the word yaṣṭi in a funerary context and this time there is an actual connection with mortuary deposits. 

  



Plate 89 

Sui Vihar Stūpa in Bahawalpur 

The inscription tells us that the wife of Balanandin, an upasika who was mis tress of the vihara, raised in Damana a yaṭhi for the bhikṣu Nagadatta and that 

It seems that in later Jainism the cult of image worship is explained and justified by the doctrine that the images of the tīrthaṅkaras are actually memorial statues. Granoff 1992, p. 191: 

The fact that temples are memorial monuments and images of the tīrtha˙nkaras are funerary statues has a certain appropriateness in the Jain traditioṇThe tīrthaṅkaras are above all martyrs, who have suffered what others might have found unendurable in their quest for religious salvation: they have also died a special death, in meditation and voluntary renunciation of all food and water. 

This ideology did not remain uncontested (Granoff 1992, pp. 194 f.; 2001, 64 f.). 







21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 427 

the mother of Balajaya, after having established the ‘foundation’ (pratiṭhana) of the yaṭhi, donated the ‘enclosure’ (anuparivara). 73 

From the not all too clear description by Major Stubbs quoted by Konow and a drawing in Indian Antiquary (Plate 89), 74 it appears that out of an earthen mound rises a brick tower of 15 m high. About half way up the tower is a room of 8 fṭsquare, i.e. measuring c. 85 by 85 cm; its height seems to have been 2ft., i.e. 60 cm. The inscription was found at the bottom of this chamber, apparently covering a square brick shaft of 16 inch, i.e. 40 by 40 cm, going down to the mound, i.e. having a length of at least 6 m. In the chamber were found ‘coins, mixed with some pieces of iron, a few beads, fragments of ornaments, all mixed up with ashes and earth’. 75 It is unknown whether the shaft ends precisely at the mound or continues into it. The chamber may have been the relic chamber, as Konow surmises, but, in view of the other occurrences of the word yaṣṭi, we cannot follow him when he takes over Hoernle’s suggestion (Hoernle 1881, 327) and proposes that the word here refers to the monk’s staff of Nāgadatta ‘set up’ or ‘assumed’ (like a bishop’s staff) at the occasion when he assumed ‘a high clerical office’. Rather it would seem, as has been proposed by Schopen, 76 that the yaṣṭi mentioned refers somehow to the brick shaft on top of which the chamber is found and which forms the central axis or yūpa of the monument. If this is the case, the structure of the Sui Vihar monument resembles closely the two mounds M and N of Lauriya-Nandangarh, in which was found, 

A hollow shaft, about 10 in. (25.4 cm) in diameter, running right through the centre from the bottom up to a little below the deposits of burnt human bones and a gold leaf. The shaft most probably indicates the position of the wooden post which had perished. At the bottom of the mound N, which was dug down to the natural soil, was actually found the stump of a wooden pillar in situ [Plate 90]. Significantly 

73 This interpretation follows mainly Sircar’s rendering in SI I, 139 f.

Konow in CII II A, 141 and Schopen 1997, 157 suggest that parivāra here might mean the room or chamber, i.e. the chamber in which the mortuary deposits and the inscription have been found. I diverge from Sircar et aḷby taking anu in composito with parivāra, a noun related to anuparivārayati: ‘to encircle’ (see Edgerton’s BHSD ṣv.).

enough, the Divyāvadāna mentions the setting up of a pillar, called yūpa[yaṣṭi], in the interior of the dome. 77 King Devāna ˙mpiyatissa, Ceylonese contemporary of Aśoka, is stated in the Mahāva ˙msa, a Ceylonese text, to have erected a stone column to mark the site of the Mahāthūpa to be constructed in future by King Duṭṭhagāmaṇī. 78 

It remains uncertain whether the brick   

shaft in the Sui Vihar monument origi 

nally enclosed a wooden column, though 

the use of the word yaṣṭi in the in scription strongly suggests that. If 

this is the case, it may be conjectured 

that the yaṣṭipratiṣṭhāna that was built 

refers to the still present brick ‘case 

ment of the column’. 79 The building ac 

tivity described in the inscription may 

thus be conceived as follows: On an 

earthen mound a wooden pole or col 

umn (yaṣṭi) of a diameter of c. 40 cm and 

a height of 6 m was erected (āropayati) 

by Balanandin’s wife; then the brick 

casement (yaṣṭipratiṣṭhāna) around the 

column was built (sthāpayitvā) by the 

mother of Balajaya; subsequently the 

same mother donated (dadāti), on top 

of the casement or shaft, a chamber or

The second yaṣṭi is clearly the post on top of the dome (aṇḍa). The yūpayaṣṭi is the pole within the aṇḍa. 

78 Mitra 1971, 24 n. 12. Cf. Bloch 1906–07, 123, plate xl (= Plate 90). A difference between the shaft in Lauriya and Sui Vihar is that the one in the latter site is square and made of bricks, whereas the one in Lauriya is circular, apparently informed by the wooden column itself. 

79 If pratiṣṭhāna would have its common meaning and refers to the ‘pedestal’ or ‘foundation’ of the yaṣṭi, the inscription does not record the exact sequence of building activities; in that case anuparivāra may refer to the casement (plus chamber?). 







21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 429 

per se. This must have been the cardinal phase of the constructioṇThe en veloping brick construction, which remains today in the form of a ‘tower’, and which always may have had a more tower- than dome-like appearance, 80 was built after the donation recorded in the inscription. 

It is evident that in the case of Sui Vihar we are concerned with a mon ument belonging to our fifth category: funerary monuments containing ashes of the deceased. Is anything similar to be found in the non-heterodox tradi tions? Or, we may ask, what had become of the Vedic option to build a citi, a pile of bricks over the bones and ashes? The citi may have occasionally lived on in burial mounds as these are attested in the Gandhāra reliefs, but when the Mahābhārata (above, n. 18 on p. 409) describes the situation at the end of the Kali Age by saying that eḍūkas have replaced temples, this expresses the concern of the author that too many people are being converted to heterodox religions, 81 not the fear that eḍūkas would eventually be worshipped all-out by those who were supposed to belong to the Brahmanical traditioṇThe few Gandhāra reliefs aside, evidence of monuments containing mortuary deposits belonging unambiguously to the Hinduized tradition in the period under inves tigation is very rare indeed. 

The archaeology of the śmaśana ¯ 

We shall leave the monuments aside for the moment and will focus on archaeo logical sites that attest the practice of cremation and inhumatioṇIn his Burial Practices in Ancient India, Singh (1970, 131) sums up the situation of iron-age burials in North India as follows: 

Evidence regarding the disposal of the dead during this period has been obtained from Sonepur, Rajgir and Lauria Nandangarh—all in Bihar; Rajghat (district Varanasi, U.P.) and Amreli in Gujarat. Besides, a large number of megalithic graves, tentatively datable to this period and later, have been located in the Vin dhyan ranges, Chotanagpur plateau, the Aravalli ranges and north-western India. The predominant mode of the disposal of the dead seems to be cremation and a limited quantity of charred human bones have been found buried either in urns or pits in the habitation-area itself. 

80 See Franz 1978, 1–18, Figs. 1–17 illustrating the ‘Turmstupa’. 

81 Allchin 1957, 1: 

Since Lassen it has been generally accepted that this description of the Kali-yuga refers to the spread of Buddhist practices and the popular desertion of Brahmanical temples. 

This is not to say, however, that the composer of this passage was exclusively thinking of Buddhism. He might have lashed out at all pan-Indian practices frowned upon by the orthodox that involved the erection of monuments over mortuary remains. Eḍūka thus seems to be a wider term than, for instance, stūpa, and it clearly has here, if not in all cases where it occurs, a pejorative connotation (cf. discussions in Goswamy 1980, 5 ff.; de Marco 1987, 228 f.). 









One of the major sites seems to have been missed by Singh, who does not refer to the excavations at Ujjain. 

The Kumhāra T. ekḍī in Ujjain 

The archaeological findings at the Kumhāra T. ekḍī in Ujjain are interesting enough to deserve our attentioṇThis mound has been the subject of a pre liminary exploration by ṀB. Garde in the season of 1938–39. It is a longish mound of about 67 m long, 33 m wide and 3 m high. Trial excavations exposed about forty-two skeletons, some of them laying on their bellies others on their backs, most of them north-south with the head towards the north, but two of them with heads pointing to the southwest (below, Plate 127). 82 Garde reports the following (AAR 1938–39, 16): 

One large urn with the neck broken off, another small urn complete, and pieces of two or three large urns were found buried in the midst of skeletons. The large urn contained a few bones, ashes and smaller pottery mostly cups and dishes. The contents of the small urn consisted of ashes and bones. A large stone mortar and quite a number of stone pedestals were found in association with the burials. [. . . ] Innumerable fragments of large and small jars, cups and dishes with which the mound is literally made up can be easily explained by this custom of burying a large number of earthen vessels and cups along with the dead body. 

Signs of cremation were also unearthed along the lower stratum reaching down to four or five feet below the surface of the mound. Thus the customs of cremation, post cremation partial burial, and simple and complete burial appear to have been in vogue almost simultaneously during the period to which this cemetery belongs. 

On account of the coins found—‘cast coins notably with the elephant or tree in railing on the obverse and the chaitya or mountain with a crescent above on the reverse’— Garde dates this śmaśāna to the 3rd or 2nd century BC (ibiḍp. 16), but the actual time it may have been in use could be many centuries longer. In addition to the skeletons and earthenware, ornaments were found, such as earrings and beads, and one wonders which purpose the ‘pedestals’ may have served. However tentative Garde’s excavation may have been, there can be little doubt that the mound revealed a prominent śmaśāna in the sense of ‘burial-cum-cremation ground’. We know of one prominent śmaśāna at Ujjain from the Sanskrit literature: it was allegedly the birthplace of the Pāśupata 

82 Annual Administration Report of the Archæological Department Gwalior State (AAR) 1938–39 p. 16: 

The faces of many were turned to the West, of some to the East, and of others upwards to the sky. The poses of a few were quite unusual for ordinary burial. Thus two skeletons had the knees bent and raised up. One of them was in a seated posture with the trunk folded and the head bent forward. Another again had the trunk twisted to right, the knees bent, and legs folded to the left. Still another was seated in a meditating attitude almost like a Buddhist monk or a jain Sadhu. A few of the skeletons, judging from their short stature and the development of pelvic cavity appeared to be females, while a few others distinctly represented youngsters.[. . . ]

movement, the site where Kuśika/Kauśika was believed to have been initiated by the Lord (bhagavat) Himself. 83 

Although this accumulation of evidence may seem substantial, if we take stock of the extent of the Subcontinent and the many centuries involved, it indicates that burial, of the complete body or partial after cremation, was a marginal rather than a central phenomenon in classical India. And, unfortu nately, it does not furnish us with factual information on the monuments to the dead outside the Buddhist sphere. 84 We don’t know how the Ujjain śmaśāna looked aboveground when it was still in use. The following find in Mansar may not solve this question definitively, but it has enough fascinating characteris tics to warrant a separate treatment, which, in combination with the material collected by de Marco, may give us some idea as to what a funerary monument of a person of consequence may have been.

84 I find it difficult to be so sure about the scene on the eastern gateway of Stūpa 1 at Sanchi, which, according to de Marco (1987, 226, Fig. 22), ‘is certainly the tomb of a yogin belonging to the same community represented in the relief’. How to explain that we have no archaeological evidence of this sort of ancient monuments of yogins, whereas we have innumerable ones of Buddhist saints? And even if it were a tomb of a yogin, I find it hazardous to conclude from this piece of ‘evidence’ (and this tentative piece alone), that the samādhis of yogins found in South Asia to date existed all throughout Indian history (de Marco 1987, 228 n. 76). 

The situation appears significantly altered in the later (post ad 1200) period, in which we find samādhis, chiefly of yogins and saints—e.g. the ‘śmaśāna of Pāśupatanāth’ il lustrated in de Marco 1987, Figs. 18 f., or the samādhis of Gorakhnāth yogis, ibid. Figs. 20 f.—and mausoleums or chatarīs of princes (Mishra 2003). This change may be partly due to Islamic influence; it falls outside the scope of the present investigatioṇFor the burial practice of the Gorakhnāth yogis see Briggs 1938, 39–43. For the development of the (esoteric) Saiva tantric concept of the ‘eight (nine) great cremation grounds’ (Sander- ´ son 2003–04, n. 208) in the syncretistic religion of Nepal see Bühnemann 2007 (cf. Mirnig 2016). 

For South India this practice is attested in the Ajitāgama (see above, n. 27 on p. 411), which reports that a liṅga may be erected for Sivabhaktas ( ´ op. cit. 63.44 f.): 

samādhibhūmau liṅgaṁca manojñaṁca sulakṣaṇam k 44 k 

pratiṣṭhāpya yathānyāyaṁnityapūjādikaṁcaret | 

The Pāraśaivas and Antarālikas are excluded from this practice ( ¯ op. cit. 63.45 f.): 

śaivānāṁpārapūrvāṇām āntarālikasaṁjñinām k 45 k 

pūrvoktavidhinā teṣāṁpratiṣṭhādīn na kārayet | 

This practice is confirmed by other (late) sources (e.g. Varṇāśramacandrikā) given in Bhatt ad Ajitāgama 63.44 ff. 









The eḍūka at Mansar 

I have dealt with the Vākāṭaka site of Mansar in several earlier publications. In Bakker 2004a I have drawn attention to the important publication of ṬA. Wellsted in the jasb xxix, in which he reports that, 

In 1928 a certain amount of interesting material came to light and led to the examination of the whole area surrounding Mansar tank, with the result that the traces of an extensive townsite were discovered. 85 

Wellsted carried out a careful archaeological survey and some of the finds de scribed in his report were donated to the British Museum. In the present context Wellsted’s site ‘T’ (Figure 11) deserves special attention. 

  



Figure 11 

Wellsted’s survey map of Mansar 

This site (encircled on the map) is situated on a direct line between the Pravareśvara Temple on the Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī (MNS 3), about 2 km to the west, and the Vaiṣṇava monuments of the Rāmagiri, 3.5 km to the east, that is to say, virtually in the middle of these two great Vākāṭaka state sanctuaries, the for mer built by King Pravarasena II, the latter by his mother, Prabhāvatī Guptā, both in the first half of the fifth century ad. The site as described by Wellsted concerns a brick shaft, uncovered and destroyed during mining work. 

85 Wellsted 1934, 161. 







21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 433 

This shaft reached to within 2 feet [60 cm] of the surface and extended downwards to the junction of the surface soil with bedrock 14 feet [4.2 m] from the surface, its total height therefore was 12 feet [3.6 m]. Of square plan, with walls of single brick construction, the space enclosed was about 4.5 sq ft [≈ 65 × 65 cm]. The bricks were of large size, 18” × 9.5” × 3.5” [≈ 45 × 24 × 9 cm]. Near the bottom, making a lower chamber 15” [38 cm] deep, was a false floor of brick. The bottom of the lower chamber was paved with brick and rested directly on bedrock. In the upper part of the shaft was filled earth from which was recovered a small snake image of greenish soapstone and some pottery. Beneath the false floor was a large spherical pot, 1 ft [30 cm] in diameter containing ashes; with it also were several small pots. (Wellsted 1934, 164) 

On the face of it, the brick construction described resembles a mirror image of the Sui Vihar monument, but there are fundamental differences. There is no subterranean tower- or dome-like construction, something hardly to be expected, whereas another, possibly more significant difference is, that the burial gifts that accompany the urn with ashes are not so much beads and ornaments as in Sui Vihar, but ritual implements such as vessels, pots, bowls (Plate 92), a lamp, two tubular, subconical pieces of red-polished ware, 86 and the Nāga image (Plate 91).

86 BM 1930.10.7.2, 3. The measurements of these two objects are 3.6” (= 9.14 cm) and 3.8” (= 9.65 cm) in height respectively (the tops of both are damaged). 









  



Plate 92 

Pottery found at site T in Mansar 

It is important to note that partly the same items have been found at the adjacent site of MNS 3, in the hypogeum which contains the so-called Man of Mansar, viz. two pots, an oillamp and an image of a snake (Bakker 2004a, 81 f.; above, Plate 87). And, finally, in contrast to Sui Vihar, no dedicatory inscription has been discovered in the burial chamber. There might have been nothing to dedicate. The shaft is likely to have ended in a monument above the ground, not an object of worship. 

The pottery and the Nāga image were stored in the British Museum in 1930, 87 but not the urn with ashes, which has disappeared. The coarse red ware, the size of the bricks and the smooth, perfectly sculptured soapstone im age of a rising cobra (Nāga), its central hood crowned by the typical Vākāṭaka flower cap, leave little doubt that the finds are Vākāṭaka. 88 

As to the form of the Nāga sculpture, this differs completely from the iron snake found near the Man of Mansar (Plate 104), but it conforms to an im age found in front of the entrance of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple on the Rāmagiri. 89 The size of the two Nāga images is different, but the similarity of concept is rather striking (Plate 93). 

The function of the Nāga may have been a protective and supportive one, representing the Vāstunāga, a concept somewhat parallel to that of 

87 The pottery: BM 1930,10.7.2–25; the Nāga image: BM 1930,10.7.1. 

88 The height of this Nāga image including pedestal is 7.6” (= 18 cm). 

89 For the iron snake found in MNS 3 see Bakker 2004a, Plate 6.24 = below, Plate 104: it is a crawling snake. The Nāgas found in front of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple and at site T, on the other hand, are frozen in a position in which the hood is raised and expanded to ward off danger; the snake hood in this position may be imagined to support what is placed on top of it (ādhāraśakti).

the Vāstupuruṣa: a local snake-deity of the site, ritually converted to the guardian of the vāstu, homologized with the cosmic Ananta, who carries the building/earth on his hoods. The major difference between both images is the number of the hoods (heads)—three in the case of the burial shaft Nāga, five in the case of the temple one—which may be explained by the difference in status of the two: one protecting a funerary monument, the other the house of a god, i.e. temple. 

  

  

Plate 93 

Nāga Rāmagiri (left), Nāga Mansar (right) 

The idea that a site belongs to and is protected by a Nāga, who underlies it, is common to the Hindu as well as the Buddhist traditions. 90 However, I conjec ture that at site T we are not concerned with a Buddhist or Jain monument, but with a funerary monument belonging to the mainstream tradition, to which the Vākāṭaka royal family belonged, and this on the following grounds: 1) the significant differences with the Sui Vihar monument; 2) the burial gifts, which at site T show correspondences with those found next to the Man of Mansar in MNS 3—viz. the pottery and the serpent—and the finds at the śmaśāna in Ujjain—the urn with ashes and the pottery; 3) the striking similarity of the Nāga of the burial shaft and the one found at the entrance of the Kevala– Narasiṁha Temple; 4) the situation of the site in between two Hindu state sanctuaries (devakulasthāna). 

90 E.g. Bose 1932, 29: ‘According to the Silpaśāstras, it is imagined that a great serpent ´ (Nāga) lies encircling every building-site.’ Rāmacandra Kaulācāra’s Silpaprakāśa ´ 1.55– 60 (Boner & Sarmā 1966, 4 f. (14 f.). Cf. the Buddhist ´ Kriyāsaṁgrahapañjikā, discussed in Tanemura 2004, 24 ff.; Cohen 1998. 







The aboveground monumental part of this grave is irretrievably lost and thoughts as to what it may have looked like are necessarily of a speculative nature. The plausibility of such speculation would be increased, though, if we could connect what still remains with other instances of funerary monuments. As such I would like to adduce the two Gandhāra reliefs left out of account so far, in particular the monument shown in de Marco’s relief B-10, a spec imen that by itself makes up this author’s type 4 (Plate 94). 91 This is the only specimen that shows a subterranean and an aboveground part, and the subterranean part consists of a brick shaft.

At the lower end of this shaft is an arched opening out of which sticks the body of Sudāya’s mother, but, as de Marco justly remarks, as in the case of the tumuli (type 1), this ‘is clearly a representational device’ (de Marco 1987, 234). The brick shaft seems badly fitted to contain a body anyway, and the thought thrusts itself upon us that we are here concerned with what is actually a burial shaft meant to contain an urn with ashes and/or bones appropriated by the artist to illustrate the legend of Sudāya. The aboveground structure is described by de Marco as follows: 

A high podium (adhovedikā) quadrangular in form (cāturāṣra sic), framed at the extremities by a moulded plinth and cyma, a basement with two tambours moulded 

91 This relief had been photographed when it was in the Karachi antique market; its present location is unknown (de Marco 1987, 210).

at the summit, and a cupola (aṇḍa or kumbha) from the centre of which rises a short pole (yaṣṭi) supporting a single umbrella ‘disc’ in the form of a spheroidal vault, similar to the topmost element (uṣṇīṣa) of the stūpa itself. 92 

De Marco argues laboriously that we are here concerned with a sort of Buddhist memorial, but his argument is not entirely convincing. It seems to me that the structure as such is non-denominational. Aside from a general resemblance with a stūpa, there are conspicuous resemblances with the aiḍūka structure of the VDhP: three receding platforms (bhadrapīṭhas), admittedly the upper two circular (the ‘tambours’) and not square, on which stands an aṇḍa (the ‘cupola’), which, in another context, could also be interpreted as a liṅga-like (liṅgarūpa) column; from this rises again a column or yaṣṭi that is crowned by a spherical element, interpreted by de Marco as a (single) ‘umbrella’ (chattri). Note, not the triple umbrella usual for a Buddhist stūpa.93 

Since Gustav Roth’s Symbolism of the Stūpa (Roth 1980), we may take it for certain that the author of the VDhP calqued his Hindu aiḍūka on a Buddhist example, but by doing this he elaborated on what must have been a monumen tal tradition that was common to all Indian religions, most pronounced within Buddhism, less in Jainism, and inconspicuous in the Hindu mainstream. 

It might be useful to draw a comparison here with the monument depicted in de Marco’s relief A-1, classified by him again as a type by itself (type 2: ‘square plan monuments’), which lacks the subterranean part of B-10, since the myth represented did not require its depiction (Plate 95). The śmaśāna scene of this relief makes it clear that it represents a funerary monument. 94 It consists of, 

A high quadrangular stone podium, decorated, on the visible side, with a sort of disc or circular emblem. From the platform rises a cylindrical structure terminating in a cupola, slightly compressed at the sides and flattened at the top, with a similar element of smaller dimensions rising from the summit. 95 

92 De Marco 1987, 212. 

93 Similar structures are depicted in the petroglyphs found in Oshibat on the upper Indus River in northern PakistaṇBemmann & K¨onig (1994) classify these pictures, given in Tafel 24–27, as ‘stūpas’, but they may rather be funerary monuments of a more general nature, as the crowning with a trident (18:227), the crescent and sun (18:127, 18:199, 18:156), or a pennant (18:269, 20:2) seems to indicate. Also the pictures in Tafel 32, classified as ‘Scene’, are monuments rather than Buddhist stūpas. 

94 This regards a relief that is kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum (IS.1-1945) and has been described by Ackermann 1975, 107–109. The scene is found in the lowest of three registers that make up this relief; it depicts the episode of a boy bound in the cemetery (i.e., śmaśāna) who takes refuge with the Buddha. For the identification of this scene see Santoro 1980, 106 f., who bases herself on the Chinese Tripiṭaka (Tsa p’i-yü ching II, 20 = Taishō Issaikyō IV, nr. 205, pp. 507, c, 7-508, a, 1), translated by P. Daffin`a. Ackermann 1975, 107 had described this funerary monument as a ‘miniature vihāra’. 

95 De Marco 1987, 196. Cf. the description given by Ackermann 1975, 107 f.: 

The vihāra between the Buddha and the boy stands on a cubic block of stone, its visible side is decorated by a round, shield-like protuberance. The vihāra itself consists of a cylindrical body and the double, vaulted roof, decorated with a rhomboid patterṇThe opening of the vihāra is assumed to be on the side turned towards the child. 









This structure too, with its alternation   

of square and round vertical elements— 

there seems to be one more quadrangu 

lar podium below the one that is deco 

rated by the ‘protuberance’—echoes the 

VDhP description, or rather the other 

way round. Although certainly differ 

ent in many details, I think that the 

structures of A-1 and B-10 are basically 

the same, and that they are variants of 

the modest beginning that in the Viṣṇu dharmottarapurāṇa, under Buddhist in fluence, has evolved into the phantas 

tic aiḍūka. Another variant of such a 

Plate 95 

Funerary monument in Smaśāna ´ 

structure, a true eḍūka, might have once crowned the burial shaft in Mansar, as it might have done the śmaśāna at Ujjain. 

A funerary monument to Prabhāvatī Guptā? 

The prominent situation of the findspot of the burial shaft, site T in Mansar, in between the two Vākāṭaka (Hindu) state sanctuaries, suggests the pres tigious character that the funerary monument must have had in the eyes of contemporaries; it may have called to mind an important public figure. In an earlier publication I have conjectured, on account of the Nāga guarding the burial chamber, that this public figure may have been Prabhāvatī Guptā her self, ‘Pravarasena’s remarkable Bhāgavata mother, the queen who styled herself as belonging to the Dhāraṇa gotra, a princess who was, on her own account, an ornament of both dynasties, the Gupta and the Nāga’. 96 

I would like to be more cautious here. If the ashes were those of Prabhāvatī she would have had two monuments, a memorial temple on the Rāmagiri and the eḍūka at issue. The latter may have marked the spot where she was cre mated, the former was the place where merit was transferred to her in the next world. The two similar Nāgas found at both sites seem to underpin this hypothesis. However, a serpent underneath a structure is a common rather than a specific feature, and, apart from that, there is little that points to any person in particular. It is therefore possible altogether that the burial shaft belonged to someone else, another king, another important person of the fifth century. The anonymity of this grave illustrates again what Malamoud sees

as the ‘l’id´eologie fun´eraire dans le brˆahmanisme’: ‘La dur´ee de vie des mˆanes est br`eve. Le culte qui leur est rendu n’est pas fait pour leur donner ou leur permettre de garder un visage’ (Malamoud 1982, 449). 

Conclusion 

The natural human inclination to erect monuments to the dead has been recog nized within the Brahmanical tradition since Vedic times. However, it did not really take root within Hinduism. Abhorrence of everything connected with death owing to its pollutive potential may be one of the explanatory factors. 97 Worship was reserved for those powers which could enhance the human con dition and mortuary remains were not counted among them. In this respect the Buddhist tradition with its human founder distinguished itself fundamen tally from the Hindu mainstream. The funerary structures pertaining to the Brahmanical sphere that we have surveyed were all, with the exception of the last one at site T in Mansar, ‘cenotaphs’ in essence. In order to reconcile the inclination to commemorate the dead with the religious propensity to increase merit through worship, the memorial temple, our category one, came into be ing. This became a resounding success. Literary and archaeological evidence for the other four categories, however, remains meagre within the period under review, the ancient and classical age. 

To erect stone steles (yaṣṭis) in memory of a dear one who had passed away may have been a wide-spread custom in South Asia from neolithic times or earlier. It was apparently unknown to Vedic religion, but was accommodated to Hindu and Buddhist practices; within both religions, however, it developed in quite divergent ways. The yaṣṭis of Andhau and the one of Sui Vihar have in common that both commemorate the death of a venerated person; one of the Andhau steles was erected for a novice nun (śrāmaṇerī). A significant difference, however, is that in Sui Vihar the deceased was an initiated Buddhist monk (bhikṣu), whose ashes were deposited on top of the yaṣṭi, thus turning the monument into an object of (relic) worship, comparable to the cult of saints in Christianity; accordingly the monument was expanded into a stūpa.98 The yaṣṭi, combined with bones or ashes and appropriating, as it would seem, the Vedic idea of the burial mound (citi), thus became the stūpa of the heterodox traditions; without mortuary deposits it evolved into the memorial stones of 

97 Malamoud 1982, 451 n. 3: 

Le cadavre est une source majeure d’impuret´e, pour les objets et les lieux, mais aussi pour les hommes. Les survivants sont atteints d’une souillure d’autant plus grave et durable qu’ils sont plus ´etroitement apparent´es au mort. 

98 The difference between monks and laymen should not be taken to be absolute. ‘Burial ad sanctos’ was, as Schopen 1997, 114–147, has shown, a common phenomenon in Indian Buddhism. 









Indian folk religion. 99 The former development is earlier than the latter. The Saka tribes, who came from a background with a rich funerary tradition, may ´ have acted as a catalyst of the second development, which did not meet with great acclaim from the side of the orthodox. 

Foreign influence may also account for another exceptional phenomenon in ancient and classical North India: the installation of human effigies within holy space, i.e. a temple. Although one indigenous example of a statue gallery has been found, this cave at Nāṇeghāṭdiffers substantially, as we have argued, from what the Kuṣāṇa kings had made for themselves. The devakulas at Māṭand Surkh Kotal are sui generis. 

Finally the aiḍūka and eḍūka. The latter, if not a pejorative for a Buddhist stūpa, is nearly as elusive as the former. In both cases we should think of vertical, elongated or needle-like constructions, mostly of brick (in which one could see an echo of the Vedic citi), combined with one or more yaṣṭis, round or square pillars or poles, raised by way of a commemorative columṇThe general Hindu reluctance to connect it with actual remains of the dead rendered it futile: being neither temple nor relic sanctuary there were not enough incentives to construct, worship and maintain it; the Hindu funerary monument or aiḍūka never really came off the ground. The only specimen recognized as such by some scholars is the one preserved in Ahicchatra, where no mortuary deposits seem to have been found (for this we reserve the word ‘aiḍūka’), but this identification is spurious. The aiḍūka of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa is a hybrid product of śāstric imagination, calqued on a Buddhist example. 

The remains of an eḍūka seem to have been preserved at site T in Mansar, where ashes have been found (hence our reference to it as ‘eḍūka’) and a sub terranean brick shaft was excavated, but where there is no longer a column above the ground. With the help of some Gandhāra reliefs we have made an attempt to visualize a structure that possibly once stood on top of the burial shaft and which to contemporaries may have been a ‘stab of pain’ (śokaśalya), reminding them of one of the great (wo)men of their age. 

99 Cf. Irwin 1980, 12: 

In my first lecture—entitled The Stūpa and the Cosmic Axis: the archaeological evidence [not available to this author]—it was shown that the primary component of the early stūpa had been an axial pillar of wood. In the earliest stage, this pillar had not been erected simply to mark the centre of the mound: it had taken structural precedence over the raising of the mound itself, the latter serving as an envelope to enclose it. Later, when earthen stūpas were superseded by more permanent structures in brick or stone, the axial function of the original type of monumental pillar was taken over by a comparitively slender pole or staff (yaṣṭi) bearing one or more umbrellas at its summit.

Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa∗ The Image of Man in the Sacrificial Context 

The image of man 

To the Greek philosopher Xenophanes (6th century bc) the following insight is ascribed: 

But if cattle and horses or lions had hands, or were able to draw with their hands and do the works that men can do, horses would draw the forms of the gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make their bodies such as they each had themselves. 1 

One of the fascinating aspects of early Indian thought as come down to us in the tenth book of the R. gveda is that such naive representation of the divine or of the anthropomorphic nature of the gods of the conventional religion had been transcended centuries before Xenophanes, in the masterly, mystical vision of the poet of the Hymn of Creation who observed: 

Non-existent there was not, existent there was not theṇThere was 

not the atmospheric space, nor the vault beyond. What stirred, where, 

and in whose control? Was there water, a deep abyss? 

Nor death nor immortality (mortals nor immortals) was there then; 

there was no distinction of night or day. That One (tad ekam) breathed 

without breath by inner power; than it verily there was nothing else 

further. 

[. . . ] 

Who truly knows? Who shall here proclaim it—whence they were 

produced, whence this creation? The gods (arose) on this side (later), 

by the creation of this (empiric world, to which the gods belong); then 

who knows whence it came into being? [. . . ] 2 

Yet, in the same book we encounter another cosmogonic idea which makes it clear that transcendental thought and human imagery could exist side by side; to which of these two visions preference was given depended evidently on the

sphere of life to which they were applied, the philosophical or the sacrificial one, both supposed to be equally valid in their own right. 

The Puruṣa has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet. He, encompassing the world on all sides, stood out ten fingers’ lengths beyond. 

The Puruṣa alone is all this universe, what has been, and what is to be. He rules likewise over (the world of) immortality (viz. the gods), which he grows beyond, by (sacrificial?) food. 

[. . . ] 

When the gods, with the Puruṣa as oblation, extended (performed) the (cosmic) sacrifice, Spring became the butter for it, Summer the firewood, Autumn the oblation. 

They consecrated on the sacred grass this sacrifice, (namely) the Puruṣa, born in the beginning. With him the gods sacrificed, the Sādhyas, and the Seers. [. . . ] 3 

It is to this sphere of sacrifice that we shall confine ourselves in the following essay. And, as may be derived from the Hymn of Cosmic Man, sacrifice of Man or human sacrifice, real or symbolic, is an integral part of the Indian ritualistic world. Philosophers may draw the forms of the world like abstract principles, ritualists prefer to draw them like tangible substances of flesh and blood or their homologous substitutes. But as we will see, the Indian genius of speculation and abstraction operated not only in the philosophical sphere. It may also take credit for the transformation of the cruelest of all sacrifices into a vision that synthesizes the realms of god and maṇWhat evidence, the sceptic may ask, do we have for human sacrifice in India? 

Human sacrifice in India 

William Crooke, one of the great connoisseurs of the living traditions of India of his time and reporter of many a crooked thing, notes in his delightful book Things Indian under the heading ‘House’: 

Very similar to these [sciḷhouses] was the earliest Indo-Aryan house, the form of which has been handed down in the marriage shed of our days. The mate rials were wood, basket-work, and clay. The main feature was the corner-posts, which were fixed in the ground with rites, sometimes including human sacrifice, intended to conciliate the earth-spirits, and were always regarded as, in some sense, sacrosanct. 4 

Sub voce ‘Human Sacrifice; Cannibalism’ Crooke adds to this,

4 Crooke 1906, 258. 







22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 445 

All through the later course of history we meet occasional instances of the custom [i.e. of human sacrifice]. First we find the foundation sacrifice, either, as some believe, intended to appease the earth-deities of the place, or as a deliberate piece of god-making, to create a divine protector of the building. Many a fort and tank, as legend tells us, were guarded in this way. [. . . ] Whenever we [i.e. the British] build a great bridge or harbour mole, our engineers are suspected of being on the look-out for victims, and people are careful not to wander abroad at night during the time the foundation is being laid. 5 

It is evident that all this ‘information’ is merely based on hear-say, but the fact that it was said and heard may be an indication that at least the notion of killing a human victim in the context of a construction sacrifice or Bauopfer was well-knowṇThat the practice was actually wide-spread in the rest of Asia, SE and E Asia including Japan, is well attested in the scholarly literature regarding the subject. 6 

With regard to South Asia, however, the evidence is apparently more prob lematic, as already indicated by the title of a recent article by two Dutch anthropologists, Jordaan and Wessing—calqued on the title of an article by the French scholar Paul Mus 7—Construction Sacrifice in India ‘seen from the East’.8 The reason why it is ‘seen from the East’ is that, on the one hand, the two anthropologists find abundant (archaeological) evidence for the practice in Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia; this leads them to infer (op. cit. 229) that this violent custom may actually have received impulses from South Asia, the cradle of the Indianized cultures and religions of Southeast Asia. In South Asia itself, on the other hand, the two anthropologists have ‘seen’ compara tively little hard evidence that could support their inference. They suspect, however, that this is not so much due to the absence of the practice itself, than to prejudice on the part of indologists—after all South and Southeast Asia share, according to them, ‘common prehistoric origins in Mus’ monsoon Asia’ (op. cit. 229), a dubious argument on which the two anthropologists set great store. Hence their exhortation: ‘Further archaeological research is obviously needed into various aspects of (human) sacrifice, without dismissing possible indicators out of hand as has been done in the past’ (op. cit. 228 f.). 

Jordaan and Wessing make a distinction into two types, which partly over lap, 

Namely appeasement sacrifice, aimed at gaining title to the land to be used from the spirits that are believed to own it, and animation sacrifice used to give the structure strength and protection by animating it with the spirit of the sacrificial victim. 9

6 See i.a. Winternitz 1887, 40; Jordaan & Wessing 1999, 211–47. Bremmer 2007. I take ‘construction sacrifice’ as synonymous with ‘foundation sacrifice’.

9 Jordaan & Wessing 1999, 219. 







In the Indian context the former type of rites could be subsumed under the category of Vāstuśānti or Vāstuśamana (‘Appeasement of the House’) ritu als. These rituals, to be performed whenever one begins the construction of and/or enters a newly built house are summarized by Kane in his History of Dharmaśāstra, Volume V, 790 f. They derive from prescripts in various texts pertaining to the Vedic tradition dealing with domestic sacrifices—the Gr̥hyasūtras—and develop in later digests to ‘a very elaborate affair’, which we, like Kane, pass over here, not ‘for reasons of space’ though, but because human sacrifice is not touched upon in this context. 

Installation of the house or Vāstupratiṣṭha 

The second type of sacrifice may be subsumed under the category of Vāstupratiṣṭhā (‘Installation of the House’), which is described by Kane (op. cit.) in Volume II, 833–36 (conflated with Vāstuśānti rites). This type of ritual also reaches back to Vedic times and is canonized in the same Gr̥hyasūtra literature. 

A central role in these rituals is reserved for the ‘Lord of the Homestead’, Vāstoṣpati, already hymned in R. gveda 7.54.1-3, a power who is represented by a firm post. Kane gives the following description of this House Sacrifice (Vāstuyajña). 

On an auspicious day and moment, the stone should be laid over jewels and all seeds; similarly the post is to be worshipped at the hands of four brāhmaṇas; the priest who should wear white garments, should be master of the Veda and should be accompanied by the artizans, should fix the post that is washed with water mixed with all herbs and covered with many whole rice and decked with clothes and ornaments to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras and the tunes of auspicious music; he should perform a homa with honey and clarified butter and should repeat the mantra ‘vāstoṣpate prati’ (R̥V 7.54.1); then the owner should feed brāhmaṇas with a dish of rice-milk. 10 

All this appears to give us little more than the usual harmless Brahminical ritualism, and seems remote from the gruesome practices in which animals or humans are slaughtered in order to lend their strength to the construction, as reported by Crooke and surmised by Jordaan and Wessing. Yet, appearances may be deceptive, especially in India. 

The two anthropologists have recourse to an authority, Stella Kramrisch, who refers to Satapathabrāhman ´ . a 1.2.3.6–7, in order to underpin the homol ogy of, on the one hand, the seeds placed underneath the foundation-stone and the rice offered to the Vāstoṣpati, and, on the other, the sacrificial animal (paśu). This homology is believed to exist, because the grain ‘has the nature of the sacrificial victim; this essence passed to sacrificial animals, it entered into 

10 Kane II, 834 f. Gonda 1980, 154: ‘An offering (sthālīpāka cooked in milk) is made to Vāstoṣpati with the formula “drive away evil; make our wealth increase; protect us always etc”.’ Cf. Bodewitz 1977–78, 59–68; Ray 1960, 311.

the horse, ox, sheep and goat, and lastly into the earth with its rice and bar ley, etc’. 11 This at first sight curious doctrine goes back to early brahmanical speculation regarding the life-sustaining substance (medha) embodied in the sacrificial victim and transmitted in the sacrificial act. The primordial cosmic Puruṣa (R̥V X.90, see above) is the fountain-head of the medha. By his being sacrificed in the cosmic Puruṣamedha the medha of the Puruṣa passed on to the horse, empowering the horse-sacrifice (Aśvamedha) etc., a lineage that fi nally makes the seeds of the earth fit for sacrifice (medhya). 12 Speaking of this conception, the French scholar Charles Malamoud warns against misinterpre tation, observing that, rather than with a historical development, we are here concerned with a peculiarity of brahmanical thought, in which each part of a structure is at the same time equivalent of and comprising the whole. 13 

All the same, it seems possible, if we take an orthodox brahmanical view, to see in the innocent vāstuyajña, House Sacrifice, its link with a less gentle, more bloody prototype, which, however, as far as house and temple building is concerned, is not attested in the texts, unless perhaps wrapped up in highly symbolic language that can be decoded only by learned brahmins and well trained indologists. Yet, to infer from this the unhistoric nature of such a bloody prototype may be a fallacy. 

The Vedic text corpus knows of an ‘animation sacrifice’, to use Jordaan and Wessing’s terminology, not to install a house or other permanent building, but to build a make-shift sacrificial fire-altar in the Agnicayana ceremony. Archae ological evidence confirms the historic reality of this type of altars in ancient India. I refer to the three Agnicayana altars found in Jagatgram (Dehra Dun District, UP). 14 

The building of the fire (agnicayana) and its altar is an elaborate and com plicated affair, which is comparatively well researched. The following summary therefore does not pretend to add anything new, but rather serves as an aide de-m´emoire.

Excursus upon the construction of the 

Agnicayana altar 

The ritual of placing a golden (i.e. immortal) man at the base of the fire-altar is i.a. described in Apastamba ¯ Srautasūtra ´ 16.22.3-4. Taken by and large, the procedure is as follows (leaving out the mantras to be recited with every act). 

After preparing the ground of the fire-altar, a knobbed, gold disk or plate is laid on a lotus-leaf; on this (plate) a man of gold is laid, directed towards the east, stretched out on his back, to the right of the hole (in the plate). Then the Puruṣasāman should be sung. 15 According to the Taittirīya Saṁhitā: 

He puts down a gold disk; gold is immortality; verily in immortality he piles the fire, for propagatioṇHe puts a golden man, to support the world of the sacrificer; if he were to put it over the perforation in the brick, he would obstruct the breath of cattle and of the sacrificer; he puts it down on the south side with head to the east: he supports the world of the sacrifice; he does not obstruct the breath of cattle and the sacrificer. 16 

Next, after the golden man has been ‘touched’ by a verse—‘The drop hath fallen on the earth, the sky, on this seat, and on the one which was aforetime; the drop that wandereth over the third seat I offer in the seven Hotrās’ 17—the serpents (sarpa) should be saluted with three verses. 

Homage to the serpents which are on the earth, the serpents in the atmosphere, in the sky, to those serpents homage etc. [. . . ] 18

Ghee is sprinkled over the maṇOn either side of the man a sacrificial ladle is laid. 19 Hereafter the laying of the bricks is begun, the first one being the svayamātr̥ṇṇā (‘the naturally pierced one’) placed on the gold man to allow him to breathe. Within the altar also a living tortoise is built. 

Then, after a square mortar (ulūkhalaka) made of udumbara wood is installed at the ‘northern shoulder’ (uttare ’ṁse) (of the fire-altar) and the fire-pot (ukhā) is placed in the middle (madhye), 20 the heads of the five sacrificial victims (paśus) are installed, the human head in the middle of the fire-pot, the head of a horse towards the west, of a bull towards the east, of a ram towards the south, and of a goat towards the north, while seven gold pieces are laid in the seven orifices of the human head. 

Hereafter Apastamba prescribes that a snake head ( ¯ sarpaśiras) should be put on the right shoulder (dakṣiṇe ’ṁse, i.e. south side) of the fire-altar (with the same verse ‘Homage to the serpents’), which is turned away from the other sacrificial heads lest, the Taittirīya Saṁhitā (5.2.9.5) remarks, it should bite these domesticated animals instead of wild ones. 21 After the snake, Apastamba ¯ (ASS 16.28.1–3) enjoins that a human figure ( ´ puruṣākr̥ti) should be assembled (cinoti) by means of twelve ‘turns’ (paryāya) each spoken trice, a (virtual?) body stretching from east to west, the head of which coincides with the head of the golden man (puruṣaśiras). The sacrificer gives praise to this construction (upahitā) by the Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa.22 

Though they seem to differ with respect to where exactly the puruṣa and the sarpaśiras are to be constructed, 23 both Black Yajurveda branches (the 

19 āSS 16.22.4: ´drapsaś caskandeti puruṣam abhimr̥śya namo astu sarpebhya iti tisr̥bhir abhimantrya kr̥ṇuṣva pāja iti pañcabhir uttaravedivat puruṣaṁvyāghārya srucāv upadadhātīty u ktam k 4 k 20 According to the tradition of the Vājasaneyins it is placed on the mortar (see SBr ´ 7.5.1.26). 

21 āSS 16.27.22: ´ namo astu sarpebhya iti dakṣiṇe ’mse sarpaśira upadadhyād viṣūcīnaṁpaśuśīrṣaih.. The verb upadhā is used for piling bricks as well as for the installa tion/placing of other items. It is therefore not clear whether a representation in brick (citi) or a real snake head is intended here. Tsuji 1983, 156 takes Mānavaśrautasūtra 8.3 to mean ‘piling of a serpent head’. Baudhāyana speaks of a ‘real’ snake head (BSS´ 10.9, Agni II, 499) that should be placed on the right (southern) part of the forehead. It may be directed towards the direction from which danger threatens the country (BSS´ 10.30; Agni II, 539). 

22 The Puruṣa Hymn, TaiAr 3.12 (= R ¯ . V X.90; above, p. 444). As has been observed by Ca land, this element may have been derived from the tradition of the Maitrāyaṇīyas (Mai trāyaṇī Saṁhitā 3.5.1), as it is not found in the Taittirīya Saṁhitā nor in Baudhāyana Srautasūtra ´ . The Srautasūtra of the Maitrāyan ´ .īyas, the Mānava Srautasūtra ´ , indeed reads as follows (6.1.8.1, 3): ‘He should construct the ‘man-layer’ (puruṣaciti) on the northern shoulder (uttarasminn aṁse). [the same formulas] Aloof from the upper part of the body (uttarārdhāt) he should construct the head of the snake (sarpaśiras) turned away (from the body) by means of the ‘Homage to the serpents’ verses (sarpanāma); or he should assign it (only) and not (actually) construct it.’ (The same alternative in āSS´ 16.27.23). 

23 The Hiraṇyakeśi Srautasūtra ´ places the serpent head on the left shoulder (see Caland 









Maitrāyaṇīyas and Taittirīyas) differ from the Vājasaneyins (represented by the Satapathabrāhman ´ . a and Kātyāyana Srautasūtra ´ ) in that the Srautasūtras of ´ both Black Yajurveda traditions prescribe this human figure and serpent head to be part of the first layer of the fire-altar. The uncertainty regarding the positioning, however, the alternative allowed by two Srautasūtras ( ´ Apastamba ¯ and Mānava) to construct the serpent head only virtually, by means of formulas, and the omission of the human figure in Baudhāyana bespeak the idiosyncrasy of this part of the ritual. 24 

It is clear that the central role of the human head (and the four animal heads) in the piling up of the fire-altar presuposes sacrificial slaughter of some sort. According to the Srautasūtras of the Black Yajurveda, the human head ´ should be cut off of a kṣatriya or vaiśya killed by an arrow or the thunderbolt, 25 after which it has to be covered with clay and set aside. 26 The tradition of the White Yajurveda is more explicit that this ritual requires a human sacri fice. The Satapathabrāhman ´ . a (6.2.1.18) unambiguously declares that ‘a man (puruṣa) should be sacrificed first, for man is the first of the sacrificial animals (paśu)’. The Kātyāyana Srautasūtra ´ states that the victim, a vaiśya or rājanya (16.1.17), should be suffocated in a special secluded place, 27 after which his head is taken (16.1.18), though it allows the option that a head of gold or clay is used as a substitute. 28 This may have become common practice when animal 

ad āSS 16.27.22). As to the place of the human figure Caland ( ´ ad loc.) remarks: ‘Art und Weise ihrer Schichtung sind undeutlich.’ 

24 It is conceivable that the theologians of the White Yajurveda, the Vājasaneyins (as well as Baudhāyana), in view of their identification of the altar with the Puruṣa (SBr ´ 6.1.1.3-7), took the totality of the bricks of the first layer itself as a representation of the puruṣa, which would render another puruṣa figure, in addition of the man of gold and the altar itself, redundant. On the other hand, though, the omission of the serpent head remains intriguing. As we have seen, the serpents were earlier invoked, by the same verses but without the examplifying head, after the man of gold had been installed and the Puruṣasāman had been sung. 

25 āSS 16.6.2-3; cf. V ´ SS 2.1.1.50 and M ´ SS 6.1.2.23 ( ´ vaiśya and rājanyabandhu). According to Baudhāyana Srautasūtra ´ 10.9 it should be the head of a vaiśya killed in battle (Agni II, 499). 

26 mr̥dā pralipya nidadhāti, āSS 16.6.7; cf. B ´ SS 10.10 ( ´ Agni II, 501). The ritual according to Caland’s translation of Apastamba (A ¯ SS 16.6.2–4) is as follows: ´ 

Dann geht er mit sieben oder einundzwanzig Bohnen in der Hand, um einen Men schenkopf zu holen, der von einem Vaiśya oder Kṣatriya herrührt, welcher durch einen Pfeil (im Kriege) oder durch den Blitz get¨otet worden ist. Nachdem er die Bohnen in der Nähe (des K¨orpers) hingeworfen hat, haut er den Menschenkopf ab mit der Formel: ,Der du hier bist, dem dir dieses Haupt angeh¨ort, durch dieses Haupt sollst du dort im Besitze eines Hauptes sein’ und legt dann an die Stelle des Kopfes einen siebenfach durchl¨ocherten Ameisenhaufen nieder. Er singt, während er rechts um das Haupt herumgeht, die drei an Yama gerichteten Verse. [. . . ]

28 KSS 16.1.32: ´ anyāni vā hiraṇmayāni vā mr̥nmayāni vānālabhyaitāṇCf. Dvaidha Sūtra (BSS 22.2): ‘As for the preparation of the heads of the sacrificial victims: Baudhāyana ´ says they should be either real or made of clay. Sālīki says that they should be real ones ´ only. Aupamanyava says that they should be made of gold.’ (Agni II, 613) 





22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 451 

sacrifice, not to speak of human sacrifice, had become tabu. The bodies of the four animal victims are thrown into the water from where the clay is taken to make the bricks. 29 What is done with the decapitated human corpse remains unclear in the Srautasūtras. The ´ Satapathabrāhman ´ . a strongly suggests that all trunks are thrown into the water: 30 

As to these glories (śriyah.), [identified with the elixir of life (rasa) in SBr 6.1.1.4.], ´ they are these very heads of the sacrificial victims and these trunks are the five (altar) layers (citi). Therefore, after having placed the heads of the sacrificial victims, one piles up the layers; then one unites these trunks with these same heads. 31 

Although the obvious interpretation takes the layers as a substitute of the trunks, it cannot be excluded that, especially in the case of the human paśu, the body of the victim was, occasionally perhaps, interred into the altar, to the effect that the Puruṣa, i.e. 1) the Demiurge Prajāpati, 2) the sacrificial victim, and 3) the sacrificer (yajamāna), became reintegrated in the sacrificial sphere, a reintegration that is the alpha and the omega of the Agnicayana, for instance reflected in the golden man. 

In total the altar consists of five layers of brick, which may have the shape of a bird, especially the śyena (hawk), which is the default, but optionally also that of a triangle, a chariot-wheel, a trough, a circle, or a burial mound (i.e. square). 32 When this brick altar has been completed the āhavanīya fire is established on it.

Preliminary conclusion 

From their inception the Indian higher, i.e. literate, religions (I am limiting myself here to Vedism and Hinduism) know of and prescribe construction sac rifices, mostly of a highly symbolic nature. To judge by the texts, human sacrifice seems only to have played a role in the construction of a make-shift fire-altar, not in that of permanent constructions. 

Theoretically, it is quite possible to conceive of an Indian construction sacri fice, including human victims, that evolved from ideas and practices developed in the context of the building of the Agnicayana altar, but if such an evolution took place, it did not find expression in Sanskrit texts dating from before the sixth century ad. It is remarkable, for instance, that the classical Indian Book of the State, the Arthaśāstra, though elaborately describing the lay-out and building of cities and fortifications (2.3), does not spend one word on construc tion sacrifices. It is of course perfectly conceivable that blood-sacrifices of this sort belonged to a realm less well represented by Brahmanical and Hindu scrip tures, but if this were the case on the scale suggested by Jordaan and Wessing, this would have become obvious long time ago through archaeology. Of course, we subscribe to their exhortation to do more unbiased archaeological research, but much of this type of research has been done, and its outcome seems to be that human remains as part of the foundations of stone buildings in India occur only rarely. 34

Archaeological evidence for the 

construction sacrifice 

Yet, unnoticed instances do occur, and I wish to draw attention to two of them here. Both of them have so far not been seen as examples of construction sacrifices, but I would like to argue that their evidence is best explained by interpreting them as such. And both could be seen as ‘construction variants’ of the Agnicayana altar, the intellectual feasibility of which was postulated above. 

Kauśāmbī 

In his report of the excavations in Kauśāmbī, G.R̥Sharma claims to have uncovered the remains of a genuine Agnicayana altar, outside of the eastern gate, within an enclosure-wall, sandwiched between the ramparts and the moat of this ancient towṇThis structure is assigned to the 2nd century bc. 

  



Plate 99 

‘General View of the Kauśāmbī excavations (1957–59) 

the Syenaciti in the foreground’ ´ 

in the excavation of a mound known as Meḍh in the village of Gokul near Mahāsthān in the District Bogra, West Bengal. In addition to this skeleton, a gold leaf with the figure of a bull has been found. The excavation is reported by ṇG. Majumdar in ASI Annual Report 1935–36, 67–69. This very interesting site requires another study, especially because there seem to be striking parallels with the Mansar excavations (see below). 

The second site is at Keesargutta, District Hydarabad of Andhra Pradesh, reported in IAR 1978–79, 63 f.: ‘The skeleton, the head facing down and hands joined together above the head, in anjali-mudra, probably represents narabali performed before the construction of the shrine.’ 









Within the alleged five layers of the altar ‘a large number of human skulls and bones of animals of different species, meticulously arranged’ were found. 35

Kauśāmbī excavation:

In layer one the excavators found, inter alia, a ‘human skull’, ‘the shell of a tortoise’ and ‘the iron model of a snake’. 36

Layer three ‘yielded the largest number of bones with a preponderance of hu man bone’: ‘three complete human skulls, ten skull pieces and other skeletal material’. 37 Summarizing, Sharma states that, 

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that this fire-altar was piled up for the performance of the Puruṣamedha. (op. cit. 126)

22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 455 

Sharma’s conclusions have been challenged by Schlingloff, whose criticism is in particular directed against the alleged historicity of the human sacrifice (puru ṣamedha). 38 The criticism of Romila Thapar takes a different route. She not so much doubts the historicity of the puruṣamedha, but calls the ‘fire-altar’ itself into question. 

The identification of the site as a fire-altar does raise some problems. The location of the altar so close to the ramparts of the city seems unusual. [. . . ] The shape of the bird as presently reconstructed appears to be rather curvilinear, whereas the bricks used for the altar would indicate a more rectilinear form. The interpretation of the objects found is also not convincing. [. . . ] The frequency of human skulls and bones would also seem to suggest a ritual different from that described in the texts and it certainly is in excess of what is required. [. . . ] there can be little doubt that the structure did represent some kind of sacrificial or funerary site. 39 

Comparison of the Kauśāmbī brick structure with the fire-altar remains in Ja gatgram makes it clear at a single glance that the two are completely different. Thapar is right when she notes that the location where this brick construction was found, at the foot of the ramparts, is unusual and I would like to go one step further, saying that this location virtually excludes the possibility that we are here concerned with an Agnicayana altar, which has to and can only be con structed in an open field. The great number of animal and human remains also seems incompatible with the Agnicayana ritual. Neither can I accept Schling loff’s suggestion that we may here be concerned with a ritual ‘Grabstätte’ or cemetery just like that. The location speaks against it and what to do with all the animal bones? The excavation is in need of a thorough reassessment, but my tentative suggestion would be that the uncovered brick structure rep resents the material remains of a construction sacrifice performed to ‘animate’, i.e. strengthen the defence constructions of the towṇTaking its clue from the paradigmatic Agnicayana, this sacrifice entailed that animals and humans were slaughtered and bricked into an altar-like structure, yielding a ‘Grabstätte’ of a very peculiar kind. And what remains valid of Sharma’s conclusions, against Schlingloff, is that the site does indeed testify to the practice of a Puruṣamedha, human sacrifice. 

Mansar 

My other example is taken from the excavations in Mansar, 5 km west of the Rāmagiri/Ramtek, Maharashtra. We shall focus here on the excavation of the site MNS 3, the so-called Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī, where a large and complicated temple complex has been unearthed. I have dealt with this excavation extensively at other occasions. 40

Here I shall concentrate on the alleged ‘two sacrificial altars, one in the shape of a śyena-citi [hawk] and the other a kūrma-citi [turtle], made of bricks’, 41 exposed by the excavators A.K. Sharma and J.P. Joshi in excavations carried out between 1998 and 2000. 42 These two putative ‘altars’ have been found half-way up a natural hill that is completely covered by brick constructions, the nature of which is controversial, but the most plausible interpretation of which takes them as the remains of a large Hindu temple complex (above, p. 421, Plate 86). The ‘altar’ layer is assigned to the 3rd century ad by the excavators, but, as we have argued, may be one or two centuries later. 

  



Plate 102 

MNS 3 (Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī): Altar Site 

As in the case of Kauśāmbī, the location—on a hillock, at the foot of, or underneath a Hindu temple—makes it very unlikely a priori that we have to do with a Vedic Agnicayana altar, as suggested by the excavators. No animal or human bones have been found in connection with these ‘altars’, but the area has yielded a most extraordinary and unique find (see above, p. 422, Plate 87).

22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 457 

In the śyenaciti, [a more than life-size] figure of a Puruṣa made of lime has been found sacrificed with his head smashed. The head of the figure is oriented towards west, whereas the legs are put towards east. A vedi in the chest portion with a hole for fixing a yaṣṭi over it was made and an earthen lamp was found kept nearby. Two pots have also been kept near the knee region of the figure which lies on his right side with an iron snake kept near his left toe, looking towards the human figure. 43 

How rapidly the decline of this unique find has set in may become apparent from photos taken three months after the discovery in 1999 (Plate 103, cf. Plate 87). 

  



Plate 103 

MNS 3: Man of Mansar (Manasarapuruṣa) 

When we collect all the unearthed evidence carefully and compare this with the ritual of building an Agnicayana altar as described in the literature, only one conclusion is possible: the Mansar site is not an Agnicayana locatioṇThe most serious objection against such an identification is perhaps that the ‘altars’, though fantastic constructions, do not consist of five layers of bricks. All the same, like in Kauśāmbī, much of the evidence seems to reflect an Agnicayana paradigm. One of the conspicuous points in common with Kauśāmbī (Plate 101) is the discovery of a little iron snake (Plate 104, cf. Plate 101). 

43 Joshi & Sharma 1999–2000, 128. 









  



Plate 104 

MNS 3: snake at the left foot of the Manasarapuruṣa 

Whereas in Kauśāmbī in the 2nd century bc the foundation structures may still have been reinforced by real animal and human victims, 600 years later, in the heyday of India’s classical culture, when the doctrine of no-injury, ahiṁsā, was fully developed, the same effect may have been thought obtainable by an effigy, the Man of Mansar, or Manasarapuruṣa. To cut a long story short, I believe that the excavators of Mansar hit upon the remains of a construction sacrifice. 

The meaning and function of the Man of Mansar, the ceremony with which he was installed, and the purport of his makers may have comprised elements from the interpretation schemes that we have discussed: 

1 The idea of reintegration of man and God through the sacrificial insertion of a (substitute) human figure into the brick fundament of an altar or sacred building, as the case may be. 

2 The idea of a (human) sacrifice to safeguard the building, by warding off genii loci, on the one hand, and by embedding it in a recreated micro macrocosmic unity, on the other. 

The Lord of the Homestead, Vāstoṣpati, who was subsequently installed and worshipped, may have been represented by a firm wooden post that was placed in the hole in the breast of the clay figure (Plate 105). 

Earlier we envisaged the theoretical possibility that a new concept of a con struction sacrifice could have evolved from ideas and practices developed in the context of the Agnicayana altar, but added that, if such an evolution took place, it did not find expression in Sanskrit texts that date from before the 







22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 459 

sixth century ad. We have seen next that the evidence of at least two archaeo logical sites is indicative of such an evolution: Kauśāmbī and Mansar, to which, maybe, Gokul (above, n. 34 on p. 452) is to be added. 

  



Plate 105 

Breast of the Manasarapuruṣa with hole to fix the Vāstoṣpati 

Discussing this material with my friend Phyllis Granoff, she made a significant observation which I would like to quote. She refers to Jain stories, 

In which people have to undergo tremendous troubles in order to build a temple. In fact, they often have to die. I think this may also be a reworking or memory trace of a construction sacrifice. Sometimes the donor or yajamāna has to die; in a few cases he has to give up the possibility of having children, which is also a kind of death. 44 

On the other hand, Granoff (op. cit. 316) refers to the ‘common belief that a temple built over bones of a dead person was doomed to collapse’. This belief may reflect the historical process, in which blood sacrifice gradually became tabu and was replaced by symbolic representations as described here. 

The Vastupurus ¯ .a 

The restrictive clause limiting our search to texts from before the sixth cen tury ad is deliberate. This is because I am of the opinion that from that century onwards we see a new concept gradually taking shape in the religious literature, an idea which raises the Kauśāmbī–Mansar progression that we ten tatively elaborated to a higher level of doctrinal abstraction, so characteristic 

44 See Granoff 1992a, 315. 









of medieval Hinduism. I mean the idea of the Vāstupuruṣa, the ‘Man of the Homestead’, first encountered in the Br̥hatsaṁhitā.45 

The author Varāhamihira (mid 6th century) begins his chapter on ‘Archi tecture’ with the following two verses, after having said that the science of house-building (vāstujñāna) came down from Brahmā. 

To be more precise, there was a being that by his body obstructed the earth and the sky; that being was forcibly seized by the immortals, who felled him, head dowṇAnd wherever a god held it, there that god became established; the Creator ordained that the House Man (vāstunara) was to consist of those immortals. 46 

This myth, which still strongly shows the mark of the Vedic concept of the Cosmic Man (Puruṣa), became the basis of an ideology that we find in nearly all Sanskrit texts dealing with the Hindu temple, be they sectarian religious scriptures (Agamas), or technical treatises concerned with architecture and the ¯ like, Silpaśāstra. The central idea is that underneath the Hindu temple lies a ´ diagram, a maṇḍala, that embodies the cosmic Puruṣa and houses all divinities. The temple, thus founded on a macrocosmic grid, is a junction of this world and the other, a fusion of micro- and macrocosm. Seen in this way the ideology of the temple continues that of the Agnicayana altar. 47 

The ritual application of the theoretical concept of the Vāstupuruṣamaṇḍala is described by ṇR̥Bhatt as follows. 

The performer of the installation ceremony then draws a diagram called Vāstu maṇḍala on the site made even and clean and performs a fire ritual to please the deities of the lords of this maṇḍala. Vāstu means a site for dwelling. Vāstu puruṣa is a deity who governs the site and is lying on the site, and his limbs are occupied by different deities. Before construction, these deities are to be pleased and permission to use the site is to be obtained. This ritual is named vāstupūjā.48 

Kandhar 

Occasionally a human-shaped figure in lieu of a maṇḍala may be found. Such a stone structure has been discovered, for instance, at Kandhar (Dist. Nanded, Maharashtra) in excavations conducted by ṀK. Dhavalikar and A.P. Jam khedkar. 49 

Excavation revealed the remains of a unique stone structure which is human shaped (22 m long and 7 m wide) and is enclosed by a double stone wall (37 m × 33 m). It is provided with an entrance on the east. [. . . ] The structure is built of dressed

The maximum length from head to toe is 23.05 m and the head portion, which is in the northwest, is 6.35 m long and 4.85 m wide. The legs, which are in the southeast direction, are 10.88 m long and their maximum width at the thigh is 2.20 m. [. . . ] The left-half of the head is destroyed. Around the head was a pavement of stone rubble in mud masonry which is 0.88 m wide. Near the legs was noticed a circular pit, which is now full of fallen stones. (IAR 1983–84, 58 f.)

This remarkable structure may be half a millennium later than the Manasarapuruṣa—dating from the Rāṣṭrakūṭa period—and lacks the lat ter’s sophistication, but it more clearly reflects the literary idea of the Vāstupuruṣa. A conspicous agreement between both figures is the direction of head and legs: northwest/southeast. 

Curdi 

Finally I would like to discuss briefly a figure found in Curdi (Goa). I am obliged to my friend Frans Janssen for sharing this information with me. The more than life-size image is made of laterite stone and is situated between a temple and a tank. In between the left arm and the trunk is the effaced image of a child still visible. 

The featuring of the child proves that we are here concerned with another type of image that may rather be classified as a fertility icoṇIn that respect 









the brief description of Dr Shirodkar in the Purabhilekh-Puratatva 50 may be correct, when he calls the image a Lajjā Gaurī, although we usually understand a completely different type of icon by that term.

Final remark 

Apart from a few rare exceptions, the idea of the Vāstupuruṣamaṇḍala is first and foremost a mythological and theoretical, ritualistic concept, which has hardly, if at all, had demonstrable effects on the actual architecture of the temple, or its archaeology for that matter. 

As such it is one more ingenuous product of brahmanical ritualistic specu lation, and it carries its hallmark: abstractioṇTaking its origin from the con struction sacrifice, such as represented by the Manasarapuruṣa, and ultimately from the Puruṣamedha in the context of the make-shift fire-altar, the sacrifice of Man or sacrifial man is thus preserved in the concept of the Vāstupuruṣa. It testifies to the civilizing force of brahmanical culture, which first banned human and then animal sacrifice, and which teaches us that even the most gruesome of religious practices can be viewed under the perspective of the sublime.

Rāma Devotion in a Saiva Holy Place ´ ∗ 

The Case of Vārāṇasī 

I do homage to Sarasvatī and Gaṅgā, 

both holy and enchanting streams; 

the latter washes away the sin of him 

who bathes therein and drinks of its waters; 

the former destroys the ignorance 

of him who speaks or hears of it. 

(RCM 1 C15.1, tr. Hill) 

Introduction 

In the eulogizing stanzas that precede the Acts of Rāma, Tulsīdās makes a curious remark: 

[I do homage] to Hara, too, and Girijā, who for the good of the world and with regard to the evil of this age composed a number of spells in a barbarous tongue, incongruous syllables, meaningless mutterings, whose influence is manifest by the power of Maheśa. (RCM 1 C15.3, tr. Hill) 

When Siva can empower even meaningless mutterings, how great then would ´ be the effect if he empowered meaningful truths? 

If the grace of Hara and Gaurī be at all truly with me, then all the influence I claim for my verses, composed in common speech, will be a reality. 

(RCM 1 D15, tr. Hill) 

These words have a special significance, since they touch upon a general de velopment in the religions of northern India, an evolution from an increas ingly abstruse, technical tantric religion taught in the Saiva ´ Agamas in a lan- ¯ guage that ever fewer people could understand—sometimes even resorting to saṁdhyābhāṣa or obstruse language—to a more simple religion of the heart, a devotion expressed in plain words of the vernaculars that have an immediate appeal to human emotions.

Siva as lord of the mantra preserved his position of eminence, but how much ´ more effective would he be, if he employed meaningful language, Tulsīdās seems to say. The Rāmacaritamānasa (RCM) is itself a specimen of this development, which we can trace several centuries back; seen in that perspective we may consider the Mānasa as an end-point rather than a beginning. 

Yet another, older conflict is hidden behind this evolution, viz. the rivalry between the Saiva and Vais ´ .ṇava religions. Although some schools of Vaisnav ism had borrowed the technical ritualistic formalism from Agamic Saivism, ¯ 1 Vaisnavism, by its nature, could more easily accommodate to less elitist, more emotional forms of worship that were on the rise in northern India from the 11th century onwards. This advantage had its effect especially in Hindu holy places, where great interests were at stake, and which were frequented by a growing stream of devotees expressing popular forms of religioṇUnlike newly emerging holy places like Ayodhyā and Braj, which were predominantly within the Vaiṣṇava domain from the beginning, an old, overall Saiva holy place like ´ Vārāṇasī must have been the theatre par excellence, in which this competition came to the fore. 

Tulsīdas, ¯ Siva, and the Name ´ 

In all his writings Tulsīdās gives Siva his due, and more than that, he beseeches ´ Sambhu to grant him attachment to Rāma’s feet. ´ Siva’s divine grace operating ´ in Vārāṇasī is fully acknowledged, for instance, in the opening verses of Tulsī’s Vinayapatrikā: 

That state which saints, scriptures and all the Purānas tell as hard won, even by great sages, 

That salvation eternal Shiva gives to all alike whose hour of death is in his city. (VP v. 3, tr. Allchin) 

Indeed, it is an ancient tradition that bestows on Vārāṇasī the power to release those who die within its precincts, a power derived from Siva’s grace. We shall ´ examine the history of this doctrine, but for doing this we take our cue from the Rāmacaritamānasa. 

In the prologue of the Bālakhaṇḍa Tulsī sings the praise of the holy Name consisting of two akṣaras: ra-ma ¯ . To highlight its effectiveness he attributes all sorts of miraculous powers to it, including Siva’s grace. Then, coming to ´ Vārāṇasī, Tulsī says: 

I do homage to rama ¯ , the Name of Raghubar, signifying fire and sun and moon; essence of Brahmā, Hari and Hara; vital breath of the Veda; impersonal, unique, treasure-house of all perfections; the Great Spell (Mahāmantra) uttered by Maheśa, who teaches it as effecting final release at Kāśī. Gaṇeśa knows its power, for by the might of the Name he is first to be worshipped. (RCM 1 C19.1–2, tr. Hill) 

1 Sanderson 2001, 35–41. 







23 / Rāma Devotion in a Saiva Holy Place ´ 465 

A little further on Tulsī is even more precise and specifies that it is this Mahā mantra, equated with the Name, that grants release to the dying, when it is compassionately bestowed upon them by Siva himself: ´ 

The immortal Sa ˙mbhu, ´ Siva, the Blessed Lord, sum of all knowledge and perfec- ´ tion, continually repeats it, and the four kinds of creatures that are in the world win to the highest realm if they die at Kāśī; (2) 

and that too, O prince of sages, is due to the greatness of Rāma, for Siva of his ´ compassion instructs them in the power of the Name. I ask you, lord, which Rāma is this? Tell me and explain, O treasure-house of grace! (3) 

(RCM 1 C46.2–3, tr. Hill) 

More pedestrian as we are, our answer differs from that of the prince of sages, Yājñavalkya; we will look for the origin of this doctrine to the beginnings of the Rāma bhakti in northern India in the 11th and 12th centuries ad. This new form of devotion that envisaged the hero of the Rāmāyaṇa as the highest form and manifestation of Viṣṇu was from the start, it would seem, intrinsically linked to the cult of the divine Name. Tulsī reports the outcome of the development in which Name and God became equated: the Name of Rāma is the supreme mantra, which alone can deliver the supreme goal, final release. 

The claims of Saiva texts and pandits in Vārān ´ . asī to the effect that it is Siva who mercifully whispers the Mahāmantra into the ear of the dying, as ´ a sort of last sacrament, is not false by itself, so the reasoning goes, but this Mahāmantra cannot be another than the supreme mantra, the Name of God. So all the Saiva followers who had always believed that this release-granting ´ formula would be a Saiva mantra had been mistaken and they must have been ´ in for a big surprise in their hours of death. 

The syllables of this mantra were not given in the early Saiva texts, as far as ´ I am aware, being a mystery to be revealed by Siva himself at the moment of ´ dying. From this mystery the Vaiṣṇavas cleverly made use when they claimed the mantra. 

The Agastyasaṁhitā 

The earliest text that bears testimony to this reframing of an ancient doctrine is the Agastyasaṁhitā. I have dealt with this text extensively in Bakker 1986, and a critical edition of it was prepared by Roelf Barkhuis as his PhD thesis (1995). For the first twenty-three chapters I am using his editioṇWe have dated the text before the Islamic revolution and its place of origin, it has been conjectured, may well have been Benares. 

In chapter 7 we read that many devotees (upāsakāh.) resort to Vārāṇasī, wishing to obtain release (mumukṣavah.). Continuously they repeat ‘śiva śiva’, and Siva, hearing this, thinks to himself: ‘how could I bestow ´ mukti to them?’ Siva asks Brahmā, who tells him that a means ( ´ upāya) does exists. Brahmā initiates Siva in the S ´ . aḍakṣara, the Mantrarāja, on the bank of the Gaṅgā in Vārāṇasī at Lolārka on a Sūryaparvan day (AgS 7.14–15). After japa and other devout practices for a long period, Rāma appears to Siva and is ready to fulfil ´ 







his wishes: 

Rāma said: 

They, indeed, who have died in your holy field, O Lord of the gods, no matter where, even worms, insects and the like, they shall immediately attain release and this will not be otherwise. (26) 

Those who obtain, either from you or Brahmā, the Six-syllable Mantra, they shall be mantrasiddhas during their lifetimes and, when they die, shall reach me. (27) 

And, O Sam ´ . kara, when one worships devoutly in this holy field with this mantra, there I shall be present, in stones, images etc. (28) 

Or, when you yourself specifies my mantra in the right ear of one who longs for release, no matter who he is, he shall be released, O Siva. (29) ´ When the God of gods had thus spoken, Sam ´ . kara answered: My preten tion is great here, in this unique holy place, (30) 

May final release be the fruit for everyone, O God of gods; and I shall give the supreme boon to all those who are about to die: the mantra. (31) 2 

In reading the Agastyasaṁhitā again, it struck me that the text actually seems to distinguish between the so-called S. aḍakṣara mantra (rāṁrāmāya namah.), in which Brahmā and Siva were initiated and which mantra should be used ´ to call Rāma’s presence in all sorts of ritual circumstances, and ‘my mantra’ (manmantra), in which mad refers to Rāma and which Siva whispers into the ´ ear of the dying. Until now I had assumed that these two mantras were one and the same, but the tradition of the name as expressed by Tulsī and the AgS itself, 3 and the fact that the AgS refers to the powerless Saiva equivalent as ´ śiva, now suggest to me that the text may have actualy meant rama ¯ .4

23 / Rāma Devotion in a Saiva Holy Place ´ 467 

This was really a dashing feat of the Vārāṇasī Ramaite pandits: to tell their clientele that in the hour of death Siva will come to their rescue by whispering ´ rama ¯ into their right ears. This is no longer a specimen of ‘Inklusivismus’, for which the Indian religions are renowned, this is downright appropriation. 

Lolārka 

The choice for Lolārka as the place of Siva’s own initiation into the Six-syllable ´ mantra may not have been arbitrary. Dedicated to Sūrya, it was one of the main, non-Saiva temples in Vārān ´ . asī in the 12th century. The inscriptions of the Gāhaḍavāla kings, who were staunch Vaiṣṇavas, mention only two Vārānaṣī temples by name in which the royal family performed pūjā, Adikeśava and ¯ Lolārka, on the two extreme ends, north and south, of the Avimuktakṣetra. A queen of Govindacandra, Gosaladevī, issued a charter, after a bath in the Ganges, in front of the deity Lolārka in ad 1150. 5 The same deity was the recipient of a grant given by Jayacandra in ad 1177 (EI IV, 128 f.). The im portant Lolārka is located near the confluence of the Ganges with the so-called Asi River at the southern tip of the holy kṣetra. 

Somehow this area of Benares remained connected with the worship of Rāma. Tulsīdās is said to have settled at what is now called Tulsī Ghāt., adjacent to the Lolārka compound and tradition has it that he died at the neighbouring Asighāṭin 1623 at the age of 80 (assī). 

The tradition of the Saving Mantra 

For the origin of the doctrine of salvation, which has contributed so much to the greatness of Vārāṇasī as a centre of pilgrimage, we have to examine the Saiva sources concerned with this holy place. ´ 

The Kāśīkhaṇḍa 

To the Kāśīkhaṇḍa (KKh) this great mantra is known as the Tāraka bra hman/mantra, ‘the saving formula’. KKh 1.7.79 reads in the eulogy that is a nirukti of Maṇikarṇikā: 

Because Siva, thought-gem ( ´ maṇi) to (all) those who are floating on the ocean of existence, speaks here (in Maṇikarṇikā), all at once in the hour of death, that 

mumūrṣor maṇikarṇyāṁtu ardhodakanivāsinaḥ| 

ahaṁdiśāmi te mantraṁtārakaṁbrahmadāyakam k 40 k 

The second of these two verses (with minor variants) is quoted by Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa (c. ad 1513–1570) in his Tristhalīsetu p. 291 together with an additional half verse (not found in the Venkatesvara edition of the Padmapurāṇa): 

śrīrāmarāmarāmeti etat tārakam ucyate k iti k 

See also Bakker 1986 I, 76. 

5 EI V, 118 l. 20: devaśrīlolārkāgre. 









saving (mantra) into the ear (karṇikā) of the good people, for that reason that (place here) is hailed as Maṇikarṇikā. 6 

Similarly in the Māhātmya of Avimukta: 

When one departs from life there, Viśveśvara himself recites the saving formula, due to which one becomes consubstantiate with him. 7 

How successful the Vaiṣṇava pandits have been in their appropriation of a golden Saiva formula, may become evident from Rāmānanda’s commentary ´ ad locum, in which tārakaṁbrahma is glossed as tārakaṁpraṇavaṁṣaḍakṣara rāmamantrarājaṁvā (similar ad KKh 1.7.79); this is again taken over, without mentioning of the source and with omission of the praṇava option, in the trans lation of G.V. Tagare in the Ancient Indian Tradition and Mythology Series: ‘Rāma Mantra of six syllables.’ The composer of the Kāśīkhaṇḍa himself seems to have identified the Tāraka mantra with the syllable om. .8 

The Kāśīkhaṇḍa is a text that is to be dated after the regime change of ad 1193. It reflects the recovery of the town and the resilience of the Hindu religious spirit in the 13th and 14th centuries, reconstructing the holy place on an unprecedented scale. The composer of the Kāśīkhaṇḍa made use of older sources, first of all Lakṣmīdhara’s Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa (TVK), which quotes the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the Matsyapurāṇa (MtP) nearly in its entirety. The latter Māhātmya may be one of the earliest in which we find the doctrine of the saving mantra. MtP 182.23cd–24ab, quoted by Lakṣmīdhara in TVK p. 17, calls it the karṇajāpa: 

For in Avimukta at the hour of death Īśvara himself presents to those who are propelled by their karma the ‘ear-whispering’ ((karṇajāpa). 9 

Until recently this was as far as we could get in tracing back this redeeming article of faith. Since the 1990s, however, an old Saiva source has become avail- ´ able that sheds light on the origin of this doctrine, namely the Skandapurāṇa (SP). I have reported on this long text in many publications and in 2004 the second volume of the critical edition of this Purāṇa has appeared. This volume

contains the Māhātmya of Vārāṇasī, and we estimate that it is the oldest text of its kind. 

The Skandapurāṇa 

Let me briefly recall a few important facts about this text. We call it ‘the original Skandapurāṇa’, because the text appears to be about a half millennium older than the oldest khaṇḍas of the printed Skandapurāṇa, with which it has hardly anything in common apart from its name. 10 We think it is the first textual composition that carries the name ‘Skandapurāṇa’, which is what the adjective ‘original’ is meant to indicate, nothing more and nothing less. 

From the 12th century onwards, this original Skandapurāṇa was gradually replaced by a series of texts that style themselves as khaṇḍas of the Skanda purāṇa. Our text, in the colophons of the three oldest manuscripts, does not refer to itself as a khaṇḍa, but simply as ‘the Skandapurāṇa’. In the 14th century this replacement had advanced so far that our text was nearly obliterated. 

We can be so certain about the early date of our text because the Na tional Archives in Kathmandu possesses three nine-century manuscripts of this Purāṇa, one of which is dated in Aṁśuvarman Saṁvat 234, i.e. ad 810. The authenticity of this text is warranted by Lakṣmīdhara, the minister and pandit at the court of the Gāhaḍavāla king Govindacandra in the 12th century, who in his description of Benares quotes extensively from a ‘Skandapurāṇa’. All his quotes turn out to be from our text, none from the Kāśīkhaṇḍa or any other khaṇḍa for that matter. 

When the text had reached the point of near-oblivion due to its replacement by later texts styled khaṇḍas, copyists in northeastern India preserved it, be it in the very margins of the Purāṇa text corpus, by renaming it the Ambikā-, or in one case, by mistake probably, Revākhaṇḍa of the Skandapurāṇa. Collation of these later manuscripts so named with the three manuscripts from Kath mandu has established that the text had evolved into a new recension that substantially differs from the ‘Nepalese’ text. We refer to this new recension as the RA recension to distinguish it from the S recension, which refers to the text as found in the Nepalese manuscripts. When we collate the quotations in Lakṣmīdhara’s Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa with the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the orig inal Skandapurāṇa, it becomes clear that an early form of this RA recension already existed in the 12th century and was used by the Nibandha author (Bisschop 2002). Further research into the history of this text has made it plausible that the new recension was created in one major redaction that took place somewhere in North India, most likely in the ninth century. 11 

The original text, we estimate, was composed either under the Maukhari kings or Harṣavardhana of Kanauj, in the second half of the sixth or first half of the seventh century. 12 

10 Cf. above, pp. 185 ff.; for borrowings from the SP by the Avantyakhaṅḍa, Yokochi 2004. 11 Bakker 2014, 138. 

12 In Bakker 2014, 137 I argued that the most likely time span is ad 570 to 620. 









Textual criticism 

Different from what some believe, this philological work is not a blind hunt for ‘the original’ in which all readings of later recensions, 

Are damned to the rubbish heap of the ‘critical apparatus’, which appears in published form as a mystifying jumble of characters and symbols creeping along the bottom of the pages. 13 

Our method aims at precisely the opposite, namely to distinguish between various layers in the text transmission, in order to be in a position to value each stage through which the text evolved on its own merits as a reflection of its time. And in this assessment the later recensions are equally valuable to us as ‘the original’ or what comes closest to it. Far from being a ‘rubbish heap’, the critical apparatus thus appears to be a precious store house of historical information. 

At the risk of being decried an inveterate ‘orientalist’, I would like to illus trate this method, finally, by tracing the doctrine of the saving mantra in the text tradition of the Skandapurāṇa. 

The saving mantra in the Skandapurāṇa 

In adhyāya 30 of the SP, that is in the middle of the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya, we read in verse 50 that ‘the devotee who dedicates all his activity to Siva ´ attains final release here in the Avimuktakṣetra, more easily than anywhere else’. This verse is found in all MSṢImmediately following this verse, however, the RA recension has two interesting verses, which are given in the critical apparatus. 

Men who are dedicated to japa and meditation as well as those who are slow-witted and deluded in matters of knowledge—their minds orientated towards external things—they (all) reach their goal in Vārāṇasī: 

Here, in the hour of death, Maheśvara himself gives (them) the saving mantra (tārakaṁbrahma), thanks to which one becomes consubstantiated with Him. 14 

The second of these verses we have already encountered in a slightly modified form in the Māhātmya of Avimukta in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa (KKh 1.25.73). This verse corresponds also closely with a prose passage in the Jābāla Upaniṣad (JābU 1). This prose passage contains two metrically correct uneven Sloka ´ pādas (beginning with prāṇeo... and yenāsāv. . . , below n. 15 on p. 470 f.), which may be an indication that the Upaniṣad text derived from a metrical exemplar, which might have been close to the verse found in the RA recension. 15 

13 Smith 2006, 25. 

14 Skandapurāṇa RA Recension 30.50 (1–2): 

japadhyānodyatānāṁca jñāneṣu bāhyacetasām | 

tamomohahatānāṁca vārāṇasyāṁgatir nr̥̄ṇām k 

atrotkramaṇakāle tu svayam eva maheśvaraḥ| 

dadāti tārakaṁbrahma yenāsau tanmayo bhavet k 

15 The prose text runs (correspondences with the RA recension of the SP in bold face): 





23 / Rāma Devotion in a Saiva Holy Place ´ 471 

It probably was a Sloka that people knew by heart and had a more or less ´ independent, floating existence, and so found its way into the Upaniṣad on the one hand, and into the Kāśīkhaṇḍa on the other. The RA recension of the Skandapurāṇa might be its first attestation. 

As already observed, the doctrine of the saving mantra is also known to the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the Matsyapurāṇa where it is called the karṇajāpa. A collation of the Māhātmyas in the Matsyapurāṇa and the Skandapurāṇa has proven beyond reasonable doubt that the Matsya borrowed from the Skanda, but it used the older Nepalese recension. 16 This, combined with the fact that both the Matsya and the revised Skanda record this doctrine of the saving mantra independently, has led us to the hypothesis that the RA redaction and the composition of the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the Matsyapurāṇa belong approximately to the same period: the 8th to 9th centuries ad.17 

It is during this period that this doctrine became widely accepted and met with the approval of orthodox brahmins and Paurāṇikas. Its origin might have been earlier. This new doctrine, namely, is connected with the inclusion of the cremation ground (śmaśāna) within the sacred fabric of Vārāṇasī. It may be conceived as a landmark in the history of the holy town: a change of paradigm by which the cremation ground, from being tabooed, became hallowed and was accommodated to the holy kṣetra. This last remark requires some explanation, and for that we turn to the oldest, ‘Nepalese’ or S recension of our text. 

Avimukta 

Vārāṇasī’s connection with death, the catering for the needs of the moribund, goes back at least to Gupta times and is a dominant feature until today. It is strongly represented in the oldest form of the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the Skandapurāṇa. This Māhātmya, which dates back to the 6th or 7th century, describes first the primordial situation, when the holy field was covered by a divine garden called udyāna or devodyāna. Siva, who has taken residence there ´ forever (a nirukti of avimukta), shows Pārvatī the garden and the liṅgas in it, which are either svayaṁbhu or have been installed by various gods, twelve altogether. Avimukteśvara is not included within this dozen, as it is conceived of as Siva’s own residence in Vārān ´ . asī. 

The twelve primordial liṅgas on the other hand are enumerated in such a way that they may be seen as forming a pattern, some sort of circuit around the Avimuktakṣetra, i.e. around the Avimukteśvara sanctuary (Figure 12). 18

The town is, on the one hand, described as a meeting place of yogis, in particular of the Pāśupata variety, on the other hand as a place where one should wish to die, as this promises immediate release. It is therefore all the more conspicuous that the cremation ground itself, the Smaśāna, is not mentioned with one word. ´ That is to say, it is not mentioned in the recension that is preserved in the Nepalese manuscripts (S). The later RA recension has, in addition to the two verses that we have quoted (above, n. 14 on p. 470), made some other highly

significant changes. Outside the Māhātmya proper, in SP 167, which gives a survey of the major Saiva ´ āyatanas including Vārāṇasī, and of which the texts in S and RA diverge widely, the eulogy of Avimukta of the S recension is replaced in RA by a passage mentioning the śmaśāna, known under the name of ‘Avimuktaka’. This brings the RA recension of the SP again alongside the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the Matsyapurāṇa, which is for the greater part a eulogy of Avimukta as cremation ground. 

Conclusion 

Although Benares from its inception as a holy place has been connected with death and the belief that dying in the vicinity of the Avimukteśvara Temple would bring immediate release, attested already in the Mahābhārata,19 the strongly felt polluting nature of the dead themselves and the disposal of their bodies made that originally the śmaśāna was considered beyond the pale of sanctified ground. 

This cremation ground was there, as it was in every Indian city, and in one of the earliest Purāṇas, the Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa, it is depicted as the unholiest place on earth, the place where king Hariścandra passed his doleful days as a caṇḍāla.20 If we assume that its location has not altered over the centuries, a location that is known in later sources as Maṇikarṇikā, it lay in the early days at the southern fringe of the then holy field, as it should do. 21 With the growth of the town, however, and the omnipresence of the dying along with the industry that surrounded them, this is beginning to change in the seventh and eighth centuries. An important factor in this process has been the spread of the belief that salvation would be available to all, if only the dying days were spent in the holy towṇThe doctrine of the saving mantra, administered there, and only there, all’ultimo momento, made Vārāṇasī stand out against all other competing holy places that promised mokṣa; this doctrine has thus greatly contributed to the reputation of the city as the most holy place on earth. 

No wonder therefore that, when a wind of change was blowing through north ern India in the 11th and 12th centuries, new religious communities jumbed on the bandwagoṇThe pandits of the emerging Ramaite faith and the cult of the Name in particular were most successful. The ingenuity and flexibility of the Indian religious mind created fresh forms of devotion, in which the old was pre served and the new could flourish. Awareness of this historical process makes that we can now fully appreciate the opening couplets of Tulsīdās’ Vinayapa trikā, which may have been composed in Vārāṇasī, when the poet felt that ‘his

The Hindu Religion and War∗ 

Preamble 

Although, since Mahatma Gandhi, India is known by many as the country where the principle of ahiṁsā, ‘not killing’, has being invented and imple mented, this ancient principle had originally little or nothing to do with how warfare was conducted and conceived in Hindu society. War was endemic in South Asia and seen as the right and duty of the Hindu king. This warfare, however, was regulated by some rules, which were humane in some respects. Battle was sometimes conceived of as a form of ritual, in which the soldiers were the sacrificial victims, but this does not entail that Hindu kings went to war for the sake of religion. 

By the 11th century the tradional Hindu view of war was seriously challenged by Islamic invaders. This essay investigates the impact of this confrontatioṇThe conflict between both communities, Hindu and Muslim, has flared up again in recent years. It is argued that the communal unrest in India since its indep endence tends to alter the Hindu self-perception and its values. 

Aśoka and ancient warfare in India 

What warfare could mean in India in the 3rd century bc we learn from Aśoka’s Thirteenth Rock-Edict. 

When king Devānā ˙mpriya Priyadarśin (i.e. Aśoka) had been anointed eight years, (the country of) the Kaliṅgas was conquered by (him). One hundred and fifty thousand in number were the men who were deported thence, one hundred thou sand in number were those who were slain there, and many times as many were those who died. (CII I, 68) 

The same Edict, however, shows that ethical principles were considered to have a relevance with respect to wartime conditions, when Aśoka continues, 

After that, now that (the country of) the Kaliṅgas has been taken, Devānā ˙mpriya (is devoted) to a zealous study of morality (dhramaśilana = dharmaśīlana), to

the love of morality, and to the instruction (of people) in morality. [. . . ] For, this is considered very painful and deplorable by Devānā ˙mpriya, that, while one is conquering an unconquered (country), slaughter (vadha), death (maraṇa) and deportation of people (are taken place) there. [. . . ] For Devānā ˙mpriya desires towards all beings abstention from hurting (akṣati), self-control, (and) impartiality in (case of) violence. (CII I, 68 f.) 

The Arthaśāstra 

The campaigns of Aśoka and his military objectives appear, generally speaking, not out of tune with what is recommended to the ‘ruler who wishes to conquer’, the vijigīṣu, in the ancient ‘Treatise on Polity’, the Arthaśāstra, which has the following to say on warfare. 

Fighting (yuddha) is said to be of three kinds—prakāśa-yuddha ‘open fight’ in the place and at the time indicated, kūṭa-yuddha ‘concealed fighting’, involving the use of tactics on the battlefield, and tūṣṇī ˙m-yuddha ‘silent fight’, implying the use of secret agents for enticing enemy officers or killing them (AS 7.6.40–41). ´ 

It is stated that when the vijigīṣu is superior in strength and the season and terrain are favourable to him, he should resort to open warfare (AS 10.3.1). In fact, a fight, ´ about the place and time of which notice has been given, is considered righteous, dharmiṣṭha (AS 10.3.26). ´ 

If the vijigīṣu is not superior to the enemy and the terrain and the season are unfavourable to him, he may resort to kūṭa-yuddha [. . . ]. 1 

The same Arthaśāstra that defines the ruler as the ‘one desirous of conquering’ and defines the specific duty (svadharma) of the kṣatriya as ‘living by the profession of arms (śastrājīva) and protecting the beings’ (AS 1.3.6) enumerates ´ among the duties common to all classes of society, including the kṣatriyas, the ‘abstaining from injury’, ahiṁsā (AS 1.3.13). From this it follows that the ´ duty of ahiṁsā is a duty that concerns the individual, but does not relate to the state, nor to the ruler of the state, the vijigīṣu, nor to those, the warriors and soldiers, who are engaged by the state to realize its aims, defence and conquest. 

Although Aśoka’s morality seems to break with this conception in that it apparently advocates bringing ethical principles to bear on the apparatus of government, he formulates this new policy of ‘conquest by morality’ (dharma vijaya) and the purpose of his proclamations—viz. ‘in order that the sons (and) great-grandsons (who) may be (born) to me, should not think that a fresh conquest ought to be made’ (CII I, 70)—only after he himself had conquered all there was to conquer. And he is not slow to add that those subjugated by him ‘should be told of the power (to punish them) which Devānā ˙mpriya (possesses) in spite of (his) repentance, in order that they may be ashamed (of their crimes) and may not be killed’ (CII I, 69). 

In other words, the policies envisaged in Kauṭilīya Arthaśāstra and Aśoka’s Edicts are not as different as they may appear at first sight: both aspire to

24 / The Hindu Religion and War 477 

bring violence (hiṁsā) firmly under government control, reserving the right to kill to the state. 

The principle of ahiṁsa and the rules of war ¯ 

Ahiṁsā 

All this is not to say that Aśoka’s conception of ‘abstention from killing animals and from hurting living beings’ (avihisā) and Kauṭilya’s maxim of ahiṁsā cover exactly the same ground. It is clear that the former is inspired by a Buddhist ethos, 2 while the second relates to a discourse of Brahmanical jurists. Hanns Peter Schmidt’s article on The Origin of Ahiṁsā, Heesterman’s Non-Violence and Sacrifice, and Bodewitz’s Hindu Ahi ˙msā and its Roots, to mention some of the main discussants, have shown that the development of this concept is an intricate one, 3 one which we shall leave aside here however, since from these studies it emerges that, whatever the origin of the concept and whatever a Dharmaśāstra author may have understood by ahiṁsā, it had no bearing on the policies of the state and the right, nay the duty of the king to wage war. 4 This right, and hence the right to stage organized killing in the interest of the state, has, to the best of my knowledge, never been questioned in the brahmanical tradition, before Mahatma Gandhi—and foreign influences play a role here—gave a new meaning to this old concept. 5 Before him, and sadly also after him, war was rather considered to be part and parcel of organized society, sanctified by those who had probably most to win and least to lose by it, the brahmanical elite. 

The Bhagavadgītā 

One example, a very early one that has however retained its unquestioned authority until today, may suffice to illustrate the point. After Arjuna had 

2 For this ethos and its implementation see Schmithausen 1999; on Aśoka op. cit. 55. 3 Schmidt 1968, 1997; Heesterman 1984; Bodewitz 1999. For a survey and bibliography of this discussion see Bodewitz 1999. Bodewitz concludes (ibid. 41): 

One may rather assume that ahi ˙msā originally belonged to the ascetic antiritualism, which was especially represented by the heretics (Buddhist and Jains) and only hes itantly obtained a foothold in the older Vedic Upaniṣads, where, however, it [sciḷantiritualism] was never associated with ahi ˙msā. 

4 Bodewitz 1999, 20: 

Killing in war was a prescript for the relevant social class and therefore pacifism can be ruled out as a decisive factor in the development of at least the Hindu concept of ahiṁsā. 

5 Schwab 1950, 474:

expressed his reservations with respect to killing his kinsmen, the Lord himself has this to say in the Bhagavadgītā. 

This embodied (soul) is eternally unslayable in the body of every one, son of Bha rata; therefore all beings thou shouldst not mourṇLikewise having regard for thine own (caste) duty (svadharma) thou shouldst not tremble; for another, better thing than a fight required of duty exists not for a warrior. Presented by mere luck, an open door of heaven—happy the warriors, son of Pr̥thā, that get such a fight! Now, if thou this duty-required conflict wilt not perform, then thine own duty and glory abandoning, thou shalt get thee evil. 6 

The continuity of the Indian tradition in this respect could not be better il lustrated than by a speech given by Bal Gangadhar Tilak at the occasion of the Shivaji Festival in 1896, organized by him to strengthen Hindu solidarity against British Rule, but simultaneously directed against the Muslim commu nity. In the Festival Shivaji’s murder of the Mogul general Afzal Khan was particularly celebrated. Tilak addresses his audience as follows. 

Let us even assume that Shivaji first planned and then executed the murder of Af zal KhaṇWas this act of the Maharaja good or bad? This question which has to be considered should not be viewed from the standpoint of the Penal Code or even of the Smritis of Manu. [. . . ] The laws which bind society are for common men like you and me. [. . . ] Great men are above the common principles of morality. These principles do not reach the place on which great men stand. Did Shivaji commit a sin in killing Afzal Khan? The answer to this question can be found in the Mahabharata itself. Shrimat Krishna preached in the Gita that we have a right even to kill our own guru and our kinsmeṇNo blame attaches to any person if he is doing deeds without being actuated by a desire to reap the fruit of his deeds. [. . . ] If thieves enter our house and we have not strength enough in our fists to drive them out, we should without hesitation lock them up and burn them alive. God has not conferred upon the foreigners the grant inscribed on a copperplate to the Kingdom of Hindustan. 7 

Tilak’s words eerily resound in the reports of what happened during the com munal riots that were sparked off by the dispute over the Babri Masjid in Ayodhyā one century later, when hundreds of Indians, mostly Muslims, were burnt alive when their houses were set ablaze by their fellow-villagers. 8 

6 BhG 2.30–33 (translation by Franklin Edgerton). Elsewhere in the Mahābhārata (MBh 12.15.20) the principle of non-injury is downright declared to be impossible in the world. Cf. Basham 1967, 123: 

In several passages of the Mahābhārata, notably in the famous Bhagavad Gītā, the evil and cruelty of war are referred to, and it is suggested that the life of the soldier is a sinful one. But such arguments are only put forward to be demolished by counterar guments, most of which are based on the necessities of this dark age of the world and on the dangers of anarchy. Positive condemnations of war are rare in Indian literature. 7 Quoted from Wolpert 1962, 86 f.

The rules of war 

All this looks pretty grim, and no doubt India has had its share of carnage and distress caused by never ending wars between states and various communities, but the picture should not be made more gruesome than necessary. There were rules that regulated warfare and that limited its destructive potential. 

The Arthaśāstra lays down that, ‘when attacking the enemy in the open bat tlefield or when storming a fort, care should be taken to see that the following categories of persons are not attacked: (1) patita, those who have fallen down, (2) parāṅmukha, those who have turned their back on the fight, (3) abhipanna, those who surrender, (4) muktakeśa, those whose hair are loose (as a mark of submission), (5) muktaśastra, those who have abandoned their weapons, (6) bhayavirūpa, those whose appearance is changed through fear, and (7) ayu dhyamāna, those who are taking no part in the fight.’ 9 These restrictions agree with the view expressed in the Mokṣadharmaparvan which ordains that, 

A king should not hurt (hiṁsyād) children or elderly people, nor him who is ex hausted, who is frightened, who has lost his weapons, who cries, who flees, who is without means, inactive, ill or begs for mercy. 10 

These rules sound particularly humane and in some respects even seem to anticipate the Geneva Convention, though one may be sceptical about their implementation in actual battle as one may be of the Geneva Convention today. Even without a statistical investigation one senses that the avowed chivalry was renounced, more often than not, also in the Mahābhārata itself. 

The reports of Megasthenes and Ibn Baṭṭūṭa 

However, unexpected though it may seem, this ‘civilized’, or one should rather say ‘ritualized’ form of warfare is confirmed by a foreign observer who lived in India in about the same period in which the Arthaśāstra was beginning to take form and Aśoka reported his conquests, namely by the Greek Megas thenes, ambassador of Seleucus to the court of Candragupta Maurya, Aśoka’s grandfather. As is well known, Megasthenes’ own book on India is lost, but much of it is preserved in Arrian’s Indika which has the following to say on the issue. 

The fifth caste among the Indians consists of the warriors, who are second in point of numbers to the husbandmen, but lead a life of supreme freedom and enjoyment. They have only military duties to perform. Others make their arms, and others supply them with horses, and they have others to attend on them in the camp, who take care of their horses, clean their arms, drive their elephants, prepare their chariots, and act as their charioteers. As long as they are required to fight they fight, and when peace returns they abandon themselves to enjoyment—the pay which they receive from the state being so liberal that they can with ease maintain themselves and others besides. 

9 Kangle 1963–65 III, 259 f. (AS 13.4.52). ´ 

10 MBh 12.286.3–4. Cf. MBh 3.19.13–14. 









[. . . ] the second caste consists of the tillers of the soil, who form the most numer ous class of the populatioṇThey are neither furnished with arms, nor have any military duties to perform, but they cultivate the soil and pay tribute to the kings and the independent cities. In times of civil war the soldiers are not allowed to molest the husbandmen or ravage their lands: hence, while the former are fighting and killing each other as they can, the latter may seen close at hand tranquilly pursuing their work,—perhaps ploughing, or gathering in their crops, pruning the trees, or reaping the harvest. 11 

The picture is too good to be true, since, for instance, the destruction of crops in the country of the enemy seems to have been common practice; but even if Indian historic reality was less idyllic than Megasthenes wanted us to believe, the essence of his observations seems to be that within the traditional Indian constellation war was primarily conceived as a gallant pastime of kings, a kind of sport that was directed towards eliminating rival kings and acquisition of glory, land and riches, not towards the destruction of neighbouring countries that were hated. An unexpected confirmation of this chivalrous ethos is found in the Travelogue of Ibn Baṭṭūṭa, who stayed in India for 15 years (c. ad 1335–1349) and who tells us, when once he was in dire straits: 

I was afraid that they would all shoot at me at once if I fled from them, and I was wearing no armour so I threw myself to the ground and surrendered, as they do not kill those who do that. 12 

Hence war could be viewed as perfectly within the precincts of the dharma and was generally not associated with evil (pāpa), though, admittedly, there were grades of righteousness. The historic reality is reflected in Indian mythology, in which heroes and gods, if they are not practising self-mortification (tapas), are continuously concerned with fighting each other, and in which monstrous atrocities are described with great gusto and approval. The epic by the mouth of Kr̥ṣṇa even openly defends the use of foul means in battle by holding up the gods as an example, 

Enemies of superior number are to be killed falsely and by (foul) means. This path has formerly been followed by the gods when they slew the Asuras; and a path followed by the good ones may be followed by all. 13 

This opportunistic and rather naive view of a privileged elite must have suffered serious blows when the kingdoms of northern India were confronted with foreign invaders. It may partly account for the fact that in these confrontations the Indian armies were often the losing party. The adversaries did not play the game by the same rules, while the Indian kings and generals appear to have been very reluctant to change them. On the other hand, when invaders came to stay they were accommodated to the Indian system and gradually dissolved

thereiṇI am thinking, for instance, of the Sakas (the Scyths), the Kus ´ .āṇas, and the Hūṇas. 

The idea of a ‘just war’ 

War thus seemed to some extent to be a natural phenomenon and needed no justification; consequently the concept of a ‘just war’ did not arise. And the multifarious and sponge-like character of the Indian religions, lacking a central authorative agency, simply did not give rise to the idea of religious wars. 14 The Arthaśāstra, on the contrary, recommends that a king adapts himself to the religious customs of the countries he has brought under his control. 

After gaining new territory, he should cover the enemy’s faults with his own virtues, his virtues with double virtues. He should carry out what is agreeable and bene ficial to the subjects by doing his own duty as laid down, granting favours, giving exemptions, making gifts and showing honour. [. . . ] Hence he should adopt a simi lar character, dress, language and behaviour (as the subjects). And he should show the same devotion in festivals in honour of deities of the country (deśadaivata), fes tive gatherings and sportive amusements. [. . . ] And he should cause the honouring of all deities and hermitages, and make grants of land, money and exemptions to men distinguished in learning, speech and piety, order the release of all prisoners and render help to the distressed, the helpless and the diseased. [. . . ] And discon tinuing whatever custom he might regard harmful to the treasury and the army, or as unrighteous (adharmiṣṭha), he should establish a righteous course of conduct (dharmavyavahāra). 15 

Though this policy seems to have been practised by many Indian kings, it did not preclude that the possession of a holy place, temple or idol could be the target of a military campaigṇYet, we should be reluctant to designate such a campaign or war a ‘religious’ or ‘holy war’, since its objective was to divert a religious asset to the use of the state rather than to enhance or defend the cause of religion itself. 

The battle and the sacrifice 

However, it will cause no surprise that in a culture that was entirely permeated by religion and that to some extent ritualized warfare, war was considered to be sanctified in another sense. The Sanskrit literature abounds in comparisons of the (ritual) battle and the sacrifice. Battlefields are seen as sacrificial grounds and the warriors killed are the sacrificial animals (paśus). Like the latter they are believed to go straight to heaveṇThus Kr̥ṣṇa speaks to Arjuna: ‘Either slain thou shalt gain heaven, Or conquering thou shalt enjoy the earth.’ 16 And like the instruments of sacrifice, the implements of war needed consecratioṇTo this end a lustration (nīrājanā) ceremony was traditionally performed at

the end of the autumnal Navarātra festival, on the ‘Tenth of Victory’ (vijayā daśamī, Dasarā), in which the ‘Invincible Goddess’ (Aparājitā) was worshipped and the king’s arms, his soldiers, horses and elephants were purified before they took to the field. 17 The festival preceding this lustration of arms, the Nava rātra, is dedicated to Durgā, who became also the Hindu goddess of war. 18 When Vākpatirāja (first half of eighth century ad) in his Gaüḍavaha (vv. 285– 338) describes the worship of Durgā by his hero, Yaśovarman of Kanauj, before this king set out on his conquest, 19 this may refer to actual practice. All this, however, does not imply that the kings went to war because of this Goddess, or for the sake of religioṇIn this respect Hinduism differed fundamentally from the Abrahamic religions. I will conclude this essay with some observations on what actually happened, when these two types of religions came into conflict. 

Hinduism and Islam 

The conquest of northern India 

From the eleventh century onwards North India was regularly confronted, per haps for the first time, with an enemy that did not adapt itself to Indian customs and did not ‘show the same devotion in festivals in honour of the deities of the country’. Instead that country was infested with marauding bands of Turuṣka warriors, after Sultan Maḥmūd of Ghazni had pointed the way in his raid on Somnath (Gujarat) in ad 1024–1025. The reports in the Kāmilu-t Tawārīkh by Ibn Asīr and the Tā-rīkh-i Alfī inform us that in the defence of the temple of Somanātha fifty thousand Hindus were killed. 20 One would have expected that in the face of such catastrophy Hindu kings would have joined hands and made common cause to defend their country and their holy places. However, ‘India’ was not conceived as an entity to be defended and Hinduism was not organized in such a way that it could offer a framework for its own defence. Hindu kings kept fighting amongst themselves and when at the end of the 12th century the Cāhamānas, who had borne the brunt of the attacks of the Muslim armies, 

17 Kālidāsa, Raghuvaṁśa 4.25–26: 

The sacrificial fire, properly fed in the ceremony of the lustration of the cavalry (vājinīrājanā), destined him (i.e. king Raghu) for victory, when, by resembling a hand as it were, its flames made the auspicious right turn (pradakṣiṇā). Leaving the centre and frontiers (of his realm) well-protected and his rear safeguarded (against in imical attacks), he marched at the head of the six units of his army, joined by fortune, impelled by desire to conquer the earth. 

Cf. AS 2.30.51 and Varāhamihira’s ´ Br̥hatsaṁhitā 44.1–2, where this ceremony is pre scribed for the 8th, 12th or 15th day of the bright half of the lunar month of Kārttika or Aśvina. See Kane 1930-62 III, 230 f., V, 188–194; Einoo 1999, 51 ff. ¯

were on the brink of collapse, their eastern neighbours, the Gāhaḍavālas did not come to their rescue. The army of the Cāhamānas under king Pr̥thvīrāja was destroyed in the second battle of Tarain (ad 1192). The Gangetic Plain lay open for conquest. 

The case of Vārāṇasī 

It would be unfair to deny the Indian kings any foresight of the events to come. It would seem that the Gāhaḍavāla kings, who had seized power in Kanauj, until then the political centre of Northern India, made an effort to employ all available means to counter the Mlecchas, the Barbarians. Apparently in response to the ‘Turuṣka’, i.e. Muslim threat from the west, they moved their capital to Vārāṇasī. 

Vārāṇasī had evolved into the most holy place of the country without being or developing into a political capital, and this appears to have been in con formity with the normal situation in South Asia, where sacred and political space customarily have different centres. 21 Hermann Kulke’s explanation of this phenomenon is that, if both were to coincide, rulers over the holy town would have to admit their enemies into their own political centre of power, due to considerations of dharma.22 If territory coincides or is identified with sacred space, wars in defence or conquest of this territory could be defined as holy wars. Yet, as we have seen, the concept of religious, or holy war for that matter, was conspicuously absent in traditional Indian political thought and so was the idea of solidarity based on a common faith and the practice of propagating war by appealing to religious sentiments more general than those conforming to the sanctified principles of dharma.23 

Hence the question may be raised why the Gāhaḍavālas moved their actual seat of power towards the sacred Vārāṇasī rather than staying within the presti gious imperial capital Kanauj. 24 This might have been caused by the fact that Kanauj lay in ruins after having been sacked twice by the Ghaznavite invaders (ad 1018 by Sultan Maḥmūd, ad 1086–90 by Prince Maḥmūd, governor of the Panjab). But it could have been rebuilt, just as Vārāṇasī itself had recovered from its first contact with Muslim forces. A more plausible explanation for the Gāhaḍavālas’ deviation from customary practice in choosing Vārāṇasī as their power base may be sought in the circumstance that the nature of the enemy had changed, an enemy which held completely different views on territorial warfare as well as on religioṇThat the Gāhaḍavālas were well aware of this from the beginning is shown by their levying of the ‘Turks tax’ (turuṣkadaṇḍa), a war

23 In this respect Hinduism does not differ from the other great Indian religion, Buddhism. Cf. Schmitthausen 1999, 63: ‘Finally, it should be pointed out that religious wars for the sake of spreading the Buddhist religion by force to non-Buddhist regions seem to have occurred very rarely, if at all.’

tax that is without parallel in India. 25 In other words, the move to Vārāṇasī may be viewed as part of the Gāhaḍavālas’ reaction to the challenge of Islam, a novel strategy to enhance prestige, boost morale and rally support. In all their inscriptions the Gāhaḍavāla kings proclaimed themselves ‘protectors of the (North) Indian holy places’ (tīrthas), to begin with those in Kāśi, and in all of them they boast of their own piety. 26 

However, if the Gāhaḍavālas had chosen Vārāṇasī as their capital in order to profit from the (religious) prestige that was connected with it, this strategy failed. It did not bring them the support of their neighbouring (Hindu) kings. On the contrary, at the eastern border they were confronted with a new power ful enemy, the dynasty of the Senas, whose king Lakṣmaṇasena (ad 1179–1206) claimed a victory over the king of Kāśi, a success that in all likelihood refers to his conquest of Magadhā. 27 Just as the Gāhaḍavālas for their part did not come to the rescue of the Cāhamānas, they themselves were not supported by their eastern neighbours in their war against the Muslim invaders. Conse quently they were defeated by the Ghūrī army at Chandawar, and Jayacandra, ‘Rāja of Benares, the chief of idolatry and perdition’ was killed on the battle field. 28 According to the Chronicle of H. asan Niz.āmī the victorious troops of Quṭb al-Dīn Aybak plundered the state treasury at Asnī and, ¯ 

Proceeded towards Benares, which is the centre of the country of Hind, and here they destroyed nearly one thousand temples, and raised mosques on their founda tions; and the knowledge of the law became promulgated, and the foundations of religion were established. 29 

It is perhaps one of the most remarkable, if not tragic qualities of holy ground that it holds a special attraction for believers of other religions. From the 13th century the Hindus had to share it with the Muslims, who selected the Hindus’ most holy spots to build their mosques, and this has been a source of

Beyond the praise which the author bestows upon his heroes, there is nothing to indicate that he was contemporary with the events which he describes, and the absence of all particulars, as well as a certain confusion and indistinctness about some of the dates, show that he was no active participator in any of his patrons’ campaigns. It is singularly strange that he says nothing of the transactions of Quṭb al-Dīn’s actual reign, for the same short chapter records his accession and his death.

endless conflict until today. The mosque erected in the time of the first Mogul emperor Babur in 1528, the so-called Babri Masjid on the site in Ayodhyā that was believed to be the Birthplace of Rāma, the Rāmajanmabhūmi, is a case in point. 30 

Epilogue 

We have seen that the notion of ‘holy war’ had not emerged within ancient India. And despite an uncompromising regime in northern India since ad 1200, which was hostile towards the quintessence of Hinduism, the temple cult, this idea was only very slow to develop, if at all. However, a constant infringement on central Hindu religious institutions must sooner or later have given rise to resistance that was inspired by religion and for which religion offered a justification; and, probably more important, it almost inevitably created a cause that could unify Hindus beyond caste, language and regional barriers. Strangely enough though, such a cause took a rather long time to develop and gathered social momentum only after Muslim authority had considerably weakened. 

Elsewhere I have discussed the outcome of this development—the trans formation of the utopian ideal of Rāma’s Rule (rāma rājya) into a political programme of the extreme right and the movement to liberate Rāma’s Birth place in Ayodhyā, which finally led to the destruction of Babur’s Mosque on December 6 1992. 31 

Yet, although the Babri Masjid/Rāmajanmabhūmi case has made it clear that a number of elements have crept into the Hindu religion which were not there before, a downright civil war in which Hindu and Muslim were taking up arms for the sake of their faiths failed to materialize. As such new elements in Hinduism one may distinguish: 

1 The formation of an exclusive community of Hindus who share the desire for a common good. 

2 The view that history has an ultimate, religiously defined goal, the Rule of Rāma or rāma rājya. 

3 A tendency to see Islam and its adherents as agents of evil, implying a demonization of the enemy. 

4 Regarding Hindus who perish during the conflicts as martyrs for the common weal. 32 

To conclude, a religion that is alive—and Hinduism certainly is such a religion— changes continuously under the influence of shifting socio-economic conditions

and the challenges posed to it by rival world-views. The impact of a secularized culture on the one hand and a world-wide tendency towards fundamentalism on the other are two factors that do not fail to alter the way in which Hindus conceive themselves and the way they experience their own religion vis-`a-vis that of their Muslim countrymeṇIt makes the study of Hinduism such an engaging activity. For the inhabitants of India it is much more than that: the development of Hinduism shapes their lives and their future. We can only hope that the Hindus will not take example from the bloody history that joins the three great Abrahamic religions.
