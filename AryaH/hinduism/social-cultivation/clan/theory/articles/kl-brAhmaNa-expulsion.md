If a Brahmin fail to observe his or her duties, the kings of Kochi had power to take away all the privilege and banish them from the caste.

A Brahman should not trade, join in popular conversation, music, dancing, or any thing else inconsistent with a grave deportment: he ought to shun temporal honours, to perform three great actions, read their sacred books, have a son, and offer regular sacrifices: after which, he may in due time, make over his duties to his son. They are not unfrequently expelled their caste, for heinous, and even trivial offences: the ceremonies which are elsewhere employed on this occasion, are here unpractised. A Namboorie woman who is sentenced to lose her caste, is sent to Tripoonterah, where a stage is erected, on which she stands, holding an umbrella over her head. The Dellawah then reads the sentence to the assembled people, declares her expelled her caste, and taking her umbrella, breaks its stick in two pieces. Persons willing to take the woman may now do so, on giving a written pro- mise, to support her whilst she lives.
