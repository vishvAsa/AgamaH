## General bits
From dIpikA: "My mom told me once. “when you and your husband are fighting with each other, you both need to remember that it’s you Two vs. The Problem, not you vs. him. That’s the best thing to remember."

From a vatsa female from Chennai at age 31: "Biggest mistake in assuming that men of our generation will be dharmic. So we started searching only by 26 thinking it will be very easy to find a simple religious guy.  Looks like only 10 % is like that. Had I known, i would have by 20 itself. In that 10 % , most are out of India or Sagotra. ... It's only unfortunate that a brahmana's very basic ritual is becoming scarce.. especially among tamil brahmins I think. ... Many boys I see, don't wear janeu, don't do sandhyavandanam, don't believe in rituals."
