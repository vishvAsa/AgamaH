title: Sources
---

- Sources of the dharma include the veda-s, itihAsa-s, purANa-s, the vedAnga called kalpa (which includes dharmasUtra-s, smRtis, dharmashAstra-s and their commentaries).
- General intro to valid sources of hindu knowledge [here](../../bases/books/index/).
- These sources are classifified into shruti (veda-s), smRti texts and shiShTAchAra (practice of learned elders).
    - All of these are ultimately said to derive from the veda-s in some traditions - hypothesizing lost veda-s and brAhmaNa-s in the process.
- Among the smRti-s
    - manu-smRti and yAJNavalkya-smRti were the most important classically (going by the number of commentaries).
    - parAshara-smRti is considered by itself (the beginning verses) and many (eg. vidyAraNya and P V Kane) as the most suitable for the kali age, due to its flexibility. Especially because it lacks a vyavahAra section. \[[UPSC05](https://books.google.com/books?id=yWfeU9eQd5YC&pg=SL1-PA174&lpg=SL1-PA174&dq=AchAra+vyavahara+prayashcitta&source=bl&ots=MJQb21hyU_&sig=n62rTw_gHZlfPijo38k9r6YJECU&hl=sa&sa=X&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMI-4vps6XnxgIVCqOICh2W_QXx#v=onepage&q=AchAra%20vyavahara%20prayashcitta&f=false)[IM](http://i.imgur.com/2pcqltY.png)\] From its recommendations regarding kShatriya-s, for example, one can allow for the existence of kShatriya-s even in the kali age.
- From a shaaastric view, all shaakhaas and all smRtis are authoritative to all (Mimaamsaa: SaakhaantaraadhikaraNam) with some rules for conflict resolution.
    - Primacy of veda-s relative to other shAstra-s - see holy books page [here](../../bases/books/index/).
- Sectarian dharmottara-s aim to faithfully summarize the dharma prescribed in the other sources.
    - shivadharmottara - "पुराणं भारतं वेदाः शास्त्राणि सुमहान्ति च/ आयुषः क्षपनायैव धर्मो ऽल्पग्रन्थसंस्थितः॥"
- Random anubhava is not traditionally considered a source of dharma. It has to be established by tarka based on texts (led by veda-s) and shiShTAchAra practices of elders.
    - For example: "न धर्मजिज्ञासायामिव श्रुत्यादय एव प्रमाणं ब्रह्मजिज्ञासायाम् । किन्तु श्रुत्यादयोऽनुभवादयश्च यथासम्भवमिह प्रमाणम्, अनुभवावसानत्वाद्भूतवस्तुविषयत्वाच्च ब्रह्मज्ञानस्य ।" (shankara in brahmasUtrabhAShyam 1.1.2).
