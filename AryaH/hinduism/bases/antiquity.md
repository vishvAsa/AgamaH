The AchArya-s knew some things better than we ever will - in domains like theology, sanskrit/ maNipravALa/ drAviDa composition, religious practice.  However, in some other areas, our understanding surpasses them, eg. the physical universe, biology, history, foreign cultures and religions etc.. They occupied the same physical universe as we do; the physical laws of nature were the same. Due to this, where the latter domains are concerned, some of their suppositions (and resultant practices) were wrong (If one honestly understood their words, as they intended them, and not make them confess strange meanings by torturing their texts). They would have expected nothing less than such honesty from us.
