title = "6 Validity of all sacred texts"

+++

Others, by contrast, accepted the validity of all sacred texts |

because in regard to all \[sacred texts\] \(i.e., while hearing all sacred texts\) notions which are not later invalidated and which are free of doubt arise, ||

because in all cases one can assume that the author is reliable, as in the case of the Veda |

\[and\] because one sees a general agreement \[with other instruments of knowledge\] as for parts \[of the teachings\] which aim at perceptible things ||101

98Bhattacharyya attributes instead to these non-Vedic authors the intention to better understand the Veda: “As they try to dive deep into the subject-matter of the Vedas \[…\]” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 553\). 

99Shah also glosses *artha * with *viṣaya*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 76. 

100E.g. non-violence \( *ahiṃsā*\) and truthfulness \( *satyavacana*\), as claimed by Kumārila, who accuses the Buddhists to have copied them from the Vedas, see TV ad 1.3.4, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 194, ll.12–13. 

101The first verse implements a Mīmāṃsā approach, arguing out of *svataḥ prāmāṇya*, the second a Nyāya approach, arguing out of the reliability of the author, with a focus on the *kāraṇadoṣa*-part of the argument mentioned in the preceding verse, the third a Nyāya approach, like in the Āyurveda-Veda argument, with a focus on the *bādha*-part of the same argument. For more details on the function of this section see the introductory study, section II.4.6. Although Shah 1975-1992 is correct in pointing to a “general agreement between those parts of the sacred texts which explain visible matters and the external things” \( *āgamonā je thoḍā bhāgo dṛṣṭārthanuṃ nirūpaṇ kare che temno bāhyārth sāthe* *prāyaḥ saṃvad*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 77\), in his English synopsis Shah seems to miss the sense of *ekadeśasaṃvāda* \(for which, see introductory study, sections II.4.1 and II.4.2\) and translates: “All scriptures are authentic because all are found to be true on this question or that, just like Vedas” \(Shah 1992-97, p. 18\).

## 6.1 Invalidity: reasons for it

### 6.1.1 The various sacred texts contradict each other

As for what has been said in this regard \(in section 1\), namely that all texts are invalid, since they teach contents which mutually contradict each other, to this it must be replied: It is not the case that one text invalidates another, since they have an equal rank \( *kakṣa*\), having been composed by a reliable author, and since one does not grasp any other reason \[to say\] that one is weaker \[than another\]. 

#### 6.1.1.1 Contradictions are inessential 
The contradiction in general, by contrast, is not important, since one notices mutual contradictions even among the Vedic sentences, whose validity is admitted \[by all\]. \[Furthermore, there are contradictions among Veda and recollected tradition:\] In the \[Vedic\] injunctions about the contact with a \[dead\] person’s head, the cup of liquor, the slaughter of a cow, etc.,102 some contents which contradict other sentences

\[found in the recollected tradition\] are indeed taught\! 

#### 6.1.1.2 No contradictions as for the main points 
Moreover, the contradiction one finds among sacred texts is not very \[significant\], since all \[texts\] agree on the principal \[point\], i.e., the aim of human \[life\]. 

The many means \( *abhyupāya*\) which are taught \( *ādiś*-\) by the various paths consisting in \[this or that\] sacred text, |

they all converge in the same final bliss \( *śreyas*\), like the streams of the Ganges

\[all converge\] in the ocean ||103

To elaborate: Heaven \( *apavarga*\) is described in all systems as something to be reached. 

Knowledge is described in all as the means to reach it. In contrast, the \[systems\] differ as for the content of \[such\] knowledge.xxvii Even in this regard, there is for the most part no dissent among the many \[systems\] as for the fact that \[such knowledge\] regards the self \( *ātman*\). 

Even according to the \[Sāṅkhya\] view that the \[salvific\] knowledge is the discrimination of the nature and the soul \( *puruṣa*\), the soul alone is what has to be known, insofar as it is separated from the nature. Those who say that there is no self \(the Buddhists\), by contrast, teach in this way so that people loose confidence \[in the Veda\] .xxviii104 But the translucent reality consisting of cognition which is accepted by them, is exactly tantamount to the self \( *ātman*\), since it is independent, namely, \[in Buddhist terms,\] it does not rely on anything else. 

And the distinction lies \[only\] in the fact that one is immovably permanent \(the self\) and the other \(the cognition\) is permanent as a flow.105

102These examples of contradictions between Veda and recollected tradition are quoted both in the NMGBh ad loc. 

and in a passage of the ŚV \(codanā v. 232\). Sucarita Miśra’s commentary on this passage of the ŚV makes it explicit that the contradiction is between Veda and recollected tradition \(Sucarita Miśra 1926-9\). 

103 *indravajrā * metre. “The many means taught by various scriptural approaches converge in the single summum bonum, as the currents of the Ganges meet in the ocean”. \(Dezső 2005, p. 229\). Just in the case of the Ganges’

streams, the differences among religious systems regard the means and not the aim. 

104Bhattacharyya translates in a way which does not seem to reflect the Sanskrit text: “Those who preach the doctrine that the soul does not exist make a show of refuting the existence of a soul” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 555\). 

105Permanence \( *nityatva*\) can be of two types: *kūṭasthanityatva * and *pravāhanityatva*. The former is the permanence of something which never changes throughout times, like a mountain \(if compared to the life-span of a human being\). 

The latter is the permanence of something which changes continuously, but whose later stages are identical with the former ones, like a river, which is always the same notwithstanding the fact that the drops of water composing it change at every second. Similarly, the *ātman * of Nyāya, Vedānta, etc. is stable, whereas the flow of consciousness of Yogācāra Buddhists continuously reproduces itself. See also the NMGBh on this passage: “The self is permanent insofar as it is immovable, i.e., its nature does not waver. By contrast, the continuous stream of cognition is \[permanent as\] a flow insofar as it flows without interruption” \( *ātmā kūṭastho ’vicaladrūpaḥ san nityaḥ, jñānasantānas* 40

#### 6.1.1.3 Contradictions in the practices are not important 
In this way, there is no dispute as for the two principal things, i.e., thing to be reached \(i.e., the liberation\) and means to reach it \(i.e., the knowledge of the self\). By contrast, the \[specific religious\] acts might be diverse according to the sacred text. Let them \[besmear their bodies\] with ashes and wear matted hair \[and\]xxix holdxxx a stick and a pot \(if they are ascetics\), or have red cloths \(if they are Buddhist monks\), or have the space alone as cloth \(if they are Digambara Jainas\): What is the

\[real\] differencexxxi here? Also, does the Veda enjoin a small number of instruments to \[reach\]

heaven, combined with a bundle of distinct procedures? \[Of course, not.\] Thus, even if there is mutual contradiction \[among the various religious practices\], there is no contradiction as for the validity \[of each religious system\]. 

#### 6.1.1.4 Conclusion: mutual contradictions do not entail invalidity 
And therefore, what is said \[by Kumārila\], namely:

If the Buddha is omniscient, what is the evidence that Kapila is not? |

Else, both are omniscient, \[but then\] how could there be distinct opinionsxxxii among them? || \( *Bṛhaṭṭīkā*, quoted in TS 3148\)

this has been discarded already, because there are no different opinions as for what is principal \(i.e., what really matters, the thing to be attained and the means to attain it\). Alternatively, \[this could be discarded\] because even if there were some \[different opinions\] with regard to some things, there would be no contradiction as for the validity \[of all religious systems\] \(since contradictions are not a sufficient reason for invalidity, see above, sections 6.1.1–6.1.1.1\).106

### 6.1.2 Suspicious practices

Nor is there invalidity of other sacred texts because they teach actions which cause the trembling of \[one’s\] heart107, since this does not prove invalidity.108

Because even the hesitation regarding eating from a human skull, etc. | depends on the influence \( *bhāvanā*\) generated by repeated practices \( *abhyāsa*\) according *tv avicchedena pravahat pravāha iti*, Shah 1972, p. 114\). Bhattacharyya nicely translates “The only difference lying between these two hypotheses is this that the soul is static but a series of phenomena of consciousness is dynamic” 

\(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 555\). 

106Bhattacharyya seems to overinterpret, possibly in order to avoid any contradiction within sacred texts \(see above, fn. 51\): “Such an objection is met thus. If they are unanimous in major topics then their difference in minor matters may be easily overlooked. But sometimes the very existence of difference invalidates a work. If an Āgama instructs a rite which loudly denounces other Āgamas then such condemnation does not amount to their invalidation since condemnation does not logically determine invalidation” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, pp. 555-556\). 

107See introductory study, section II.4.4. The NMGBh explains: “The trembling of the heart is the hesitation” 

\( *hṛdayakrośanaṃ vicikitsā*, Shah 1972, p. 114\). 

108 *prayojaka * is a technical term in inference, denoting the characteristic \( *dharma*\) which really causes the invariable concomitance \( *vyāpti*\) and, through it, the ascertainment of the *probandum *\( *sādhya*\), as opposed to other accidental aspects of the same thing. For instance, within the Śyena sacrifice, *hiṃsātva * is *aprayojaka * in regard to *adharmatva*, whereas *niṣiddhatva * is *prayojaka * in regard to *adharmatva *\(ŚV anumāna 17cd-18ab\). Cf. ŚV anumana 13cd–15ab: *vyāpteś ca dṛśyamānāyāḥ kaś cid dharmaḥ prayojakaḥ || asmin saty amunā bhāvyam iti śaktyā nirūpyate | anye para-prayuktānāṃ vyāptīnām upajīvakāḥ || tair dṛṣṭair api naiveṣṭā vyāpakāṃśāvadhāraṇā | *“And when an invariable concomitance \( *vyāpti*\) is observed, \[only\] a certain characteristic \( *dharma*\) is its *prayojaka*, \(i.e., that which really causes the ascertainment of the *probandum*\). This *prayojaka * is described by its potentiality \[to lead to the *probandum*\] \( *śakti*\) as follows: when there is the *prayojaka*, the \[ *probandum*\] must be there. Although other \[characteristics\] are seen

—which are \[not *prayojaka * but only\] parasites \(i.e., living off the real *prayojaka*\), since the *vyāpti * is caused by the real *prayojaka*— the ascertainment of the part which is the *vyāpaka *\(i.e., the *sādhya*\) is never accepted by means of these \[parasitic characteristics\]”. 

41

to other views \( *darśana*\) \(for instance, the practice of not touching bones\)109 ||

And similarly, there is hesitation also in regard to the violent acts \[prescribed\] in the Veda |

on the part of the \[brahmans\] who have peaceful minds \( *citta*\) \[and\] have compassion towards all living beings ||

In regard to violence such as black magic \( *abhicāra*\), although it is Vedic, let there well bexxxiii a trembling of \[one’s\] heart \[it does not harm our position\], becausexxxiv violence \(namely, black magic\) is the instrument-part \[among the three parts of a ritual action, which are result, instrument, and procedure\].110 Therefore, one undertakes it \(violence\) out of desire \[not because of a Vedic prescription, since the latter describes the means to achieve a violent result, but only for the one who has already decided that he wants to achieve it\].111

By contrast, the violence \[inflicted\] on the animal, such as the Agnīṣomīya rite, is part of the procedure, and in regard to it one acts out of a prescription, since \[Śabara has said that\]

“In fact, what is for the purpose of the ritual is understood out of the Veda \( *śāstra*\)”. Even in regard to this \[violence\] a compassionate person hesitates. And he says: If the dharma is the slaughter of a living being, what would be the adharma?112

But the Veda is not invalid because of this. It shall be the same for the other sacred texts, too \(they also do not become invalid just because there is something in them which makes one hesitate\). 

### 6.1.3 Practices prohibited by the Veda

#### 6.1.3.1 Prohibitions are not text-independent 
As for what has been said \(in section 5.2.1.2\)

—namely that even if through the texts other \[than the Veda\], such as the Kaula ones, one realises goals such as flyingxxxv, the sinfulness \( *pratyavāya*\) caused by the practices of something prohibited surely occursxxxvi at a later time— this too is wrong, because such content is not prohibited in the \[corresponding\] sacred text. In fact, even if it is prohibited in a different sacred text, assuming that one can choose through option \[one or the other set of norms\] is appropriate. And since this \[practice of something forbidden\] is the means to obtain a high human aim \(such as flying\), given that one \[actually\] realises it, how could there be sinfulness? 

\(If there had been sinfulness, this would have blocked the obtainment of the goal.\)113

109 *darśana * is ambiguous and could refer to experiences or opinions. The NMGBh explains as follows: “The view \( *darśana*\) which one has repeatedly experienced, i.e., ‘Having touched a human bone together with the fat \[one should bath with one’s clothes\]’, \[becomes\] the \[view\] of one’s inner organ, together with the traces

\[of this repeated experience\]” \( *punaḥ punar yad abhyastam “nāraṃ spṛṣṭvāsthi sasneham” ityādidarśanaṃ tat-saṃskāravāsitāntaḥkaraṇānām*, Shah 1972, p. 114\). Bhattacharyya adds a useful explanation: “Such a doubt arises in our mind since we are familiar with the teachings of the other systems of thought, have framed a habit of thinking in that direction and possess deep-rooted impressions of the contrary teachings. In other words, we have formed a peculiar angle of vision. From that point of view we find fault with the above prescription. But we do not dive deep into the merits of the question” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 556\). 

110“Let there well be a trembling of \[one’s\] heart, since the prescription does not function in regard to such violence

\[…\]. For it is part of the instrument” \( *bhavatu kāmaṃ hṛdayotkampaḥ, tasyāṃ hiṃsāyāṃ vidher avyāpārāt. \[…\]*

*karaṇāṃśopanipātinī hīti*, NMGBh Shah 1972, p. 114\). 

111Jayanta may be following Śabara in that he calls the Śyena *hiṃsā*, whereas Kumārila will deny it and rather say that the act itself is not violent, only its result is \(see Kataoka 2011b, pp. 158-169\). Jayanta also follows Śabara insofar as he repeats that the Veda does not enjoin the Śyena, it only teaches it for the one who himself wants to achieve a violent result, see ŚBh ad 1.1.2, Frauwallner 1968, p. 20. 

112The source is unknown. A similar verse is quoted in a later Buddhist text, the *Avadānakalpalatā*, 55.17 \(Okano 2008, p. 67\), which could point to a Buddhist origin of this concept. 

113Bhattacharyya interprets *parapuruṣārtha * as the highest goal: “If they are proved to be the means to the ultimate goal of a human being then how can it lead to a pit-fall?”. On this interpretation of *parapuruṣārtha*, see also Kataoka 2007b, pp. 83–84. But in fact Jayanta has just stated that these sacred texts can make one achieve particular goals, 42

#### 6.1.3.2 Violating a prohibition regards the performer, not the text 
Else, let there be that at a later time on the basis of this \[behaviour\] there is sinfulness. Nonetheless, in this case \(eating from a skull, etc.\) the validity of the text is not lost , since the ritual action \(e.g., eating from a skull\) is enjoined as having a certain fruit \(e.g., flying\) on the basis of the difference among the people entitled \[to perform them\], like in the case of the Śyena \(thus, “If you want to fly, eat from a skull” parallels “If you want to harm your enemy, perform the Śyena”\).114

In the \[prescription\] “He should sacrifice using black magic by means of the Śyena”, through the present participle in “using black magic” \[the Veda\] says that the person entitled \[for the Śyena\] is one who has already disregarded a prohibition.115 And for such \[a person\] the Śyena sacrifice has been enjoined. And he becomes surely sinful, once he has accomplished a killing out of performing it \(the Śyena\). But \[it does not follow that\] the Veda is invalid. And it has been said \[by Śabara:\] “Here \[in the Veda\] both are denoted by the \[Vedic\] injunction, the good and the evil” \(ŚBh ad 1.1.2, Frauwallner 1968, p. 20\). And due to the distinction among the entitlements \( *adhikāra*\), the injunctions about various ritual actions are not inadequate. 

For the one who wants to die, the Sarvasvāra sacrifice is enjoined; for the one who wants a long life, the oblation of cereal preparations \( *caru*\) \[in the weight\] of \[hundred\] berries of Abrus precatorius \[is enjoined\]. Therefore, even this \(injunction of a prohibited ritual action\) is not the occasion \[leading\] to the invalidity \[of a sacred text\]. 

#### 6.1.3.3 Figurative meaning 
Also the confutation of the caste-system \[found\] in the Buddhist texts, points at a laud of the extreme compassion \( *karuṇā*\) directed to favouring all \[and\]

should not be understood as one hears it \(i.e., literally\). And in the same way, in these very

\[Buddhist texts\] it is recited: “One should not allow to become a monk people who are flawed because of their \[low\] caste or of a body\[-defect\]”.116

## 6.2 Validity

### 6.2.1 Nyāya-based argument: reliable authors

Therefore, it is correct that all sacred texts are valid, insofar as they have been composed by reliable speakers, such as Kapila, the Buddha and the Arhat. 

#### 6.2.1.1 God as reliable author 
Othersxxxvii think that the revered Lord alone is the author of all sacred texts.117

Because he, looking down at the fact that the maturation of karman \[occurs\] in many ways and perceiving \( *uddṛś*-\) that there are various paths towards the obtainment of heaven, understands which people are adequate for a certain ritual act and teaches this or that instrument in accord to the disposition \[of each person\] in order, out of mercy, to favour all living beings. 

And the Revered alone, attainsxxxviii this or that different name out of assuming various bodies such as flying, not the ultimate goal of human liberation. Accordingly, Bhattacharyya skips altogether “flying” and gives instead“communion with Śiva” as an example of a realised goal \(Bhattacharyya 1978, pp. 556–7\). Elsewhere Jayanta has *paramapuruṣārtha * for *mokṣa*; accordingly here *parapuruṣārtha * might mean “high, but not highest”. 

114And therefore what is sinful is desiring a certain fruit, not the fact that a sacred text tells you what to do next, see introductory study, section II.4.5. 

115“For the ending of the present participle in ‘using black magic’ is in the sense of characterising. And a characteristic must be already established” \( *abhicarann iti hi śatṛpratyayo lakṣaṇe. lakṣaṇaṃ ca pūrvasiddhaṃ bhavati*, NMGBh, Shah 1972, p. 114\). 

116 *Vinayasūtra * 26.29 \(v. 153\). Probably the passage originally rather meant “People whose bodies are defected since their birth”, i.e., who are permanently invalid. Shah reads *kāryaduṣṭa * with NM and translates: “one who makes a lower job” \( *kārya duṣṭ *\(= *hīnakarmvānī *\), Shah 1975-1992, p. 81\). In his English synopsis he just skips *kārya*: “one belonging to a mean caste should not be admitted \[…\]” \(Shah 1992-97, p. 19\). 

117This view is repeated as Jayanta’s own in NM 6, NM, p. 258, where Jayanta explains that the six Vedāṅgas are in fact without beginning and authored by God. 

43

through the might of his power \( *vibhūti*\). And he alone is called Arhat, Kapila \[and\] Buddha, since if one postulates various omniscient people there would be the unwanted consequence of cumbersomeness in one’s efforts \[of postulation\]. 

\[Obj.:\] But the Buddha is the offspring of the king Śuddhodana \(i.e., he is a historical figure, not the timeless God\), how could he be the Lord? 

\[R.:\] This has been refuted by the revered Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana \(i.e., Vyāsa\): For whenever the dharma weakens, o Bhārata |

and the adharma rises, I create myself || \( *Bhagavadgītā * 4.7, Sukthankar, Belvalkar, and Vaidya 1933-1971, 6.26.7\)

The body alone is the offspring of Śuddhodana, not the inner soul \( *ātman*\). For the same reason the knowers of the \[Vaiṣṇava\] sacred texts believe that at each age of the world the same revered Viṣṇu descends \[in the world\] in the form of dharma.118

#### 6.2.1.2 Agreement of the exemplary people 
\[Obj.:\] But why is there not a similar agreement on the part of the exemplary people in regard to the other sacred texts, given that they have the same author as the Veda \(i.e., the Lord\)? 

\[R.:\] It is not so. A small number of living beings, the ones for which such a disposition of mind has been recognised, are favoured by the revered \[Lord\] through a certain path \(e.g., the Buddhist one\). By contrast, innumerable living beings are favoured \[by the Lord\] through the Vedic path. Therefore, this one is hold in great honour, the other sacred texts in little \[honour\]. 

#### 6.2.1.3 Conflict: already explained away 
\[Obj.:\] If there is a single author,xxxix how could there be mutual contradictions? 

\[R.:\] As for this topic, the Vedas themselves depict the solution. The \[reason\] has been already said \[in section 6.1.1.1\]: For even in the \[Vedas\] one sees plenty of mutual contradictions. Therefore, the validity of all sacred texts truly depends on the fact that they have been composed by the Lord. 

### 6.2.2 Mīmāṃsā-based arguments: Veda-base

Others \(upholders of the Mīmāṃsā approach\), by contrast, accepted the validity of all sacred texts insofar as they are based on the Veda. For, the reasoning which has been said \(in section 2.1.1.2\) as for the fact that the teachings of Manu etc. are based on the Veda, namely: the \[Vedic\] injunction is more economical than error or experience, human utterance \[and\] fraud \[as base of the MDhŚā, etc.\], due to the consistence with what we see and the capability \[of producing a result such as the MDhŚā\] ||119

this is common to all sacred texts. Nor does one directly grasp a Vedic text which is the root of the recollected traditions of Manu, etc. \[just like one does not grasp it in the case of Buddhist texts, etc.\]. But if one assumesxl \[a Vedic root\] out of inference, the same \[holds true\] also in the case of the other sacred texts. 

118This enigmatic *dharmarūpeṇa * might be interpreted as “in the form of a dharmic \[person\]”, i.e., “of a person which can be regarded as embodying dharma”. Bhattacharyya has “as an incarnation of divine law” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 558\). 

119Just like above, see fn. 45, Bhattacharyya interprets the ablatives as all expressing causes: “We should not hold that Manu’s law-book is reliable because it has been composed by a trust-worthy person since to err is human, the words of a person sometimes mislead us and a hypothesis should be based upon facts. We shall make minimum assumptions if we hold that the said book is based upon the Vedas” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 559\). 

44

#### 6.2.2.1 Having common performers is not the main point 
\[Obj.\] But it has been said \(in JS 1.3.2, see section 2.1.3\) that “Rather, \[the established conclusion is as follows:\] Because the performers are common, the inferential cause \(i.e. the recollected tradition, insofar as it lets one infer a Vedic text\) is an instrument of knowledge”. But this does not occur in this case \(since the performers are different\). Thus, how can one infer a Vedic text? 

\[R.:\] This is not a flaw. 

Understanding that there is a single entitlement \[for both the Vedic rituals and the other ones\] does not prove the validity \[of the latter\] |

by contrast, it might be the reason, if you want \[to attribute some usefulness to it\], for establishing the performance of \[elements learnt in the Veda and others learnt in the recollected tradition\] mixed together120 ||

Nor is it the case that a ritual action, even if performed separately \(i.e., by a separate group of performers\) is not based on an instrument of knowledge, like the ritual actions which must be performed \[by some only\], according to the differences of classes and stages of life. 

\[Obj.:\] Since there are no common performers, then \[these other sacred texts\]

arise out of a different root \(e.g., error\) |

\[R., based on the Mīmāṃsā approach:\] This is not true, since the \[possibility of a faulty root\], such as error, has been rejected, because there is no subsequent invalidating cognition121 ||

Furthermore, the assumption that \[these texts\] could have perception as their root is too cumbersome |

On the other hand, the appropriate root in their regard are the Vedasxli, since they have endless branches ||

#### 6.2.2.2 Conflict: There are endless Vedic branches and hence potentially no conflict

\[Obj.:\] But in regard \[to these texts\], why do the knowers of the Veda hate \[the idea\] that they are based on the Veda? |

\[R.:\] One should approach them and ask them, if one finds \(enough\) courtesy \( *dākṣiṇya*\)xlii \[so that one can approach them without upsetting them\]\! ||

Or, given that the slaughter of a cow is clearly Vedic, how can they hate \[the other sacred texts\] \(provided that their behaviour is not more commendable than the one prescribed by the other sacred texts\)? |122

120For a usage of *miśra * in the context of mixing Vedic and smārta elements, see NMGBh ad *ācamanādismārta-padārtha*, section 2.1.3 quoted in Kataoka 2004a, p. 208. 

121See section 2.1.1.2 for the *svataḥ prāmāṇya * approach, according to which the cognition is valid unless there is an invalidating cognition. See also introductory study, section II.4.1. 

122An alternative interpretation is the one adopted in Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 560: “Why do the Mīmāmṣakas cherish hatred against cow-slaughter which has been clearly prescribed by the Vedas?”. Similarly, in his English synopsis, Shah translates as follows: “It too is no objection that the followers of the Vedas are hostile towards other scriptures, for such hostility is not proper and, moreover, the followers of Vedas are hostile even towards a practice like cow-slaughter which is a very clear Vedic practice” \(Shah 1992-97, p. 20\). But this interpretation does not seem to fit the context, in which these brahmans are orthodox ones, who do not hesitate in regard to the slaughter of cows. 

Shah follows the reading of the *editio princeps*, Jayanta Bhaṭṭa 1895-1896 \( *gatvā ta eva pṛcchyantāṃ yeṣāṃ dveṣādi* *vidyate*\) and construes *gatvā * as having a different agent than *pṛcchyantām*: “The one who opposes the validity of these Buddhist texts, he should go to the Buddhists who hate \[some Vedic rituals\] and ask them: ‘Why do you hate the killing of a cow, which is clearly Vedic?” \( *bauddhādi āgamonā prāmāṇyano virodhī —jemne dveṣ vagere che te* *bauddhāhinī pāse jei temne je pucho ke je spaṣṭapaṇye vaidik karm che te govadhamāṃ temne dveṣ kem che? *, Shah 1975-1992, p. 84\). This interpretation could be justified as meaning that disgust in general cannot be a criterion, since some \(like the Buddhists\) are even disgusted by Vedic practices. But the point here seems not to be general disgust, but rather disgust on the part of Vedic scholars. 

45

And the fact that they contradict \[the Veda\] has been refuted \(in section 6.1.1\), and is difficult to be known due to the endless number of Vedic branches \(so that there could always be a Vedic branch supporting a certain non-Vedic text\) ||

Thatxliii which stays in front of our eyes, is it the entirety of the Vedas? 

Or \[since it is not, as we all know\], what is the evidence that agreement is not obtained out of another Vedic branch \(one you do not know yet\)? ||

And in the same way, a Vedic inferential mark123 is grasped aiming at suggesting that the nature is made of three qualities, \[as is\] well-known in the Sāṅkhya system, namely \[the Vedic statement\] “Unborn, single, red, white and black”. \[Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 4.5\] And this explanatory passage, which praises the knowledge of reality assisted by ascesis \( *tapas*\) \[just like it is\] composed \(taught\) by hermits of the Jaina Nirgrantha \[sect\], is found \[in the Veda\]:

“The sages \( *muni*\) have the wind \( *vāta*\) as their girdle \( *raśana*\)” \[Ṛgveda 10.136.2a\] \(i.e., they are naked\).124 Similarly, experts \[in the Veda\] also do perceive \( *labh*-\) a root for wearing red clothes, \[using\] ashes and holding skulls and other \[seemingly non-Vedic behaviours\]: Therefore, although \[Buddhist and other non-Vedic texts\] cannot share the same performers \[with the Veda\], as it happens to be the case for the recollected traditions of Manu, etc., |

the recollected tradition consisting of all sacred texts can be said to be an instrument of knowledge because \[these are all\] based on the Veda ||

And therefore:

Whatever dharma has been proclaimed by Manu for anyone |

this is denoted in the Veda, since it \(the Veda\) consists of knowledge about all ||

\(MDhŚā 2.7\)

Like the mention of Manu in this passage implies through synecdoche \[all\] the authors of recollected traditions, such as Gautama, Yama, Āpastamba, Saṃvartaxliv, in the same way

\[the mention of Manu\] should be explained as also aiming at implying the Arhat, Kapila, the Buddha, etc. 

#### 6.2.2.3 Lokāyata texts have no independent value 
\[Obj.\] But in this way also in regard to the sacred texts of the Lokāyatas there would be validity, because one sees that \[they\] have a Vedic root, namely: “The mass of consciousness arises out of these elements and then vanishes with them. There is no awareness \( *saṃjñā*\) after death”.125 And therefore, once the Lokāyata system has become valid,xlv adieu \( *svasti*\) to all other sacred texts\! 

\[R.:\] It must be replied:

Since in the Lokāyata \[system\] nothing to be done is taught |

\[theirs\] is only an eristic talk, and no sacred text ||

\[Obj.\] But there \[something to be done\] is indeed taught:“Until one lives, one should live happily”. 

\[R.:\] No, because in this case there is no fruit of \[such\] teaching \[and no teaching can exist if it does not yield any result\], since it is already established out of our own nature \(it 123 *liṅga * in the context of the Veda refers to mantras and statements which aim at something other than themselves. 

124Bhattacharyya thinks that the passage refers instead to Buddhists: “The Buddhists hold that the sages live only on the air. It is a repetition of the Vedic conclusion that the realisation of consciousness as the ultimate reality is the goal of life” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 560\). 

125BṛUp 2.4.12-14 and 4.5.13-15 \(almost identical\). 

46

is useless to teach something we already know, and we know that we have to be happy, since we naturally want to be happy\). As for what \[Lokāyatas\] teach, such as: “The dharma should not be done”, “As for the teachings \[of the Veda\], one should not believe \[them\]”, this has already been refuted, since the Lokāyata system is based on the Objector’s statements \[found in the Vedas\]. And in the same way, there is in this regard the Brāhmaṇa\[-passage\] answering

\[the passage quoted above as the Vedic root of the Lokāyata system\]: “I am not really saying anything confusing. This self is in fact imperishable. It has \[only\] a \[temporary\] connection with the elements \( *mātrā*\)”.126

Therefore, in this way, it is not the case that the system of the Lokāyatas has a principal value,xlvi because it is based on an objector’s statement, just like \[the objector’s statements have no independent value and must be understood as subsidiary to something else\]. In other words,xlvii it should not be honoured because it has been refuted already by the answering sentence \[in the same passage quoted above\]. 

By contrast, for the other systems \( *śāstra*\) it is wrong to postulate that they are based on an objector’s sentence, since one does not grasp immediately after \[the sentence which is their Vedic root\] a statement refuting it. 

Therefore, all sacred texts are valid because they are based on the Veda \(the Lokāyata and similar texts are not sacred texts, but just opponent’s statements\). 

## 6.3 Conclusion through Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya arguments

\[Obj.:\] “Once one has justified in this way the validity of all sacred texts |

whateverxlviii a sacred text I compose today ||

in a few days this would surely become valid, too |

\[because\] even in its regard the reasoning mentioned above would easily apply \(i.e., it would be valid, because one could find a Vedic root, or because one could assume that it has been written by a reliable author, given that people agree on its validity\) ||

I hear \( *kila*\) that some deceiver, after bringing whatever has been written in an old book, announces “This is a great Text”.127 One would have to assume a reliable author even for it\! 

Alternatively, one would have to say that the one \[or\] the other Vedic sentence is its root. 

\[R.:\] It is not so. Only the Texts which reached the general opinion without objections \( *avigīta*\)128 \[among normal people\],|

and which have been embraced 129 by many cultivated people ||

126BṛUp 2.4.12-14 and 4.5.13-15 \(almost identical\). Walter Slaje argues in favour of the latter as source, since Mīmāṃsakas tend to quote from that dialogue \(Slaje 2007, 141, fn. 96, where “*not * in 4.4” probably means “*not * in 2.4”\). The last sentence is only present in the Mādhyandina Recension of the BṛUp \(published in Böthlingk 1889\), but not in the Kāṇva recension \(which is the one followed by Olivelle in his Olivelle 1996\). The same last sentence is also present in a slightly different quote of the same passage in the ŚBh: *na vāre ’haṃ mohaṃ bravīmi, avinaśī*

*vāre ’yam ātmānucchittidharmā, mātrāsaṃsargas tv asya bhavatīti *\(Frauwallner 1968, p. 60, ll.20-22\). 

127This risk had already been sensed by Kumārila: “Because even today one sees people who speak out contents which are not found in a sacred text imposing on them the \[wrong appearance\] of having been written in a sacred text” 

\( *dṛśyante hy anāgamikān apy arthān āgamikatvādhyāropeṇa kecid adyatve ’py abhidadhānāḥ*, TV ad 1.3.1 Subbāśāstrī

1929-1934, p. 160\). Bhattacharyya seems rather modern in inverting the sentence, which thus favours novelty: “The book which is very old is reported by some cunning fellows as a new one” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 562\). 

128See ŚV codanā 133, section 6.4.5 in Kataoka 2011b, where three invalidating criteria are mentioned, i.e., *vigānāt*

‘disagreement’, *chinnamūlatvāt *‘being based on an interrupted tradition’ \(addressed below as *apūrvā iva bhānti*\) and *kaiścid eva parigrahāt *‘being accepted only by a few’. 

129If we want to distinguish it from the preceding *prasiddhi*, it must be “embrace”, “accept as one’s own practice”, cf. *vedapathapravṛtta * in 5.2.3.3. See also the introductory study, section II.4.6.1. 

47

and which, while functioning today,130 do not appear totally unprecedented |

which are not based on greed, etc., \[and\] which people do not fear:131 ||

only these texts are here \(in this view I am explaining\) regarded as valid |

By contrast, it is not is conceded that any opinion of a bawd is an instrument of knowledge ||132

To elaborate:

Thexlix Nīlāmbara religion \( *vrata*\),133 in which many activities \( *ceṣṭā*\) are performed by a man and a woman united \[and\] wrapped \( *nivīta*\) in a single black cloth, it is reported, has been made up by some parasites \( *viṭa*\) ||134

The King Śaṅkaravarman, who knows the reality of dharma prohibited \[it\], knowing that it was a new \[addition\] |

By contrast, he did not \[prohibit\] in the same way the opinion of the Jainas, etc. ||135

Therefore, due to the fact that \[the Vedic texts\] have been uttered by a reliable

\[speaker\], \[a reason\] whose all flaws \( *doṣa*\) enunciated by others have been stolen \(i.e., removed\), |

validity has come to a firm ascent on these Vedic texts.136 Then, due to the fact that they are based on these \(Vedic texts\), or that they have been uttered by a \[reliable\] person, the same condition must hold for all sacred texts |

Even through this \[reason, i.e., because they depend on an author\], it cannot be said that the Vedic utterances are faulty \[since the author is reliable\] ||137

130Bhattacharyya: “Though they may have been recently composed” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 562\). 

131Above \(section 6.1.2, 6.1.2.1 in Kataoka 2004a\) it has been said that suspicion \( *vicikitsā*\) is not enough to infer invalidity, therefore *udvij*- must have a stronger connotation, although in usage the two tend to be synonyms \(see introductory study, section II.4.4, see also the end of section II.2 for a different interpretation\). Towards the end of NM 6 \(NM, p. 259\) the Bṛhaspati’s teachings are said to be *udvegakārin *‘causing anxiety’. See also introductory study, section II.4.6.1. 

132Bhattacharyya understands this verse as referring to a precise work: “Any and every treatise should not be considered to be an authentic one. Shall we accept *Kuṭṭinīmatam *\(a book written by Damodara Gupta\) in which advice has been given by a senior prostitute to the junior ones as an authentic one?” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 562\). 

V. Raghavan interpreted this verse as a mention of the *Kuṭṭanīmata*, and thus as an evidence for dating Jayanta \(Raghavan 1964, p. vi\). 

133About which see *Āgamaḍambara*, act 2, Dezső 2005, p. 116, also describing this practice; see also introductory study section II.4.7. 

134 *āryā * metre. 

135 *āryā * metre. 

136 *upagatam*- is constructed with accusative, cf. *na praroham upagacchet*, *Tantrālokaviveka * by Jayaratha, ad 9.159, Mishra 1992-1997, p. 461 \(other examples of *upagam*- and *praroham * can be found in the same text\). 

137 *sragdharā * metre. Bhattacharyya: “But under no circumstances one can point out defects in the Vedas on the ground that the Vedas are not based upon a source book” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 563\).

## Notes

i *vatsa pṛcchasi * with K1, also in accordance with the fact that *vatsa * is generally used in the vocative. 

ii *prāmāṇyaṃ * as in K1. 

iiiWe kept *ca * because K1’s reading *tu * is probably an overinterpretation made in order to better fit the context. 

ivWe have adopted *kim atra trikālānavacchedena tadavacchedena vā kṛtyam, against kim atra trikālānavacchedena* *kṛtyam * of K1, although the *tadavacchedena vā * could seem a later expansion, because of the parallel *kim iva hi trikā-lasparśāsparśābhyāṃ kṛtyam * in NM, p. 271, l.6 —vol. I. 

v *abhiniveśa*, as in K1 against *durabhiniveśa*, unnecessary. 

vi *purāṇam api bhavatu pramāṇam * like in K1 against *purāṇānām api bhavatu prāmāṇyam*, also because the syntactic role of *smṛtivat * is, in the latter case, odd. Jayanta could have just written: *vedamūlatvāt smṛtīnām iva purāṇānām api* *bhavatu prāmāṇyam*. 

viiPlural as in K1. 

viiiPlural as in K1. 

ix *āmukhe * as in all editions and manuscripts against K1’s *āmukhataḥ*, because locative-constructions are generally used by Jayanta in similar contexts. 

x *kalāpa * omitted like in K1, also because one does not need the whole set of three, one element is enough to invalidate a notion. Still, an eyeskip is also possible, due to the three *ka* s \(- *kāraṇakāluṣyakalāpa*-\). 

xiWe drop *veda*- at the beginnning of the compound, like in K1, because it seems an unnecessary addition and because in section 5.2.2.1, the *caturvarṇya * is said to be *āryadeśaprasiddha*. 

xii *ye copaniṣad*- instead of *sarvopaniṣad*-, following K1. 

xiii *tair eva * with K1 against *tenaiva*, also because *upavarṇitam * requires a human agent. Shah reads *tenaiva*, but explains “Kṛṣnadvaipāyana” \(Shah 1975-1992, p. 73\). 

xiv *tadyāgaś * with K1 against *tadyogaś*. Shah reads *tadyogaś*, but interprets it in the same way: “Rudra’s and Viṣṇu’s yoga, i.e. the means to please them” \( *rudr ane viṣṇunā yogo arthāt emane ārādhavānā upāyo*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 73\). 

xv *tadyāgā * with K1, against *tadyogā*. 

xvi- *mocakādyāgamāḥ * with K1 against - *mocakāgamāḥ*. 

xvii *pāpācāra*, more common, with K1 against *pāpakācāra*. 

xviii *teṣāṃ * with K1 against *teṣu*. 

xix *tatra * correlative of *yatra * as in K1. *tasya * is probably later and due to the desire of making explicit that the pronoun refers to *prāmāṇya * in the previous compound. 

xxWithout *ya ete*, against K1. 

xxi“*ākāras tu tasya kīdṛśaḥ, pānipādaṃ kīdṛśaṃ śirogrīvaṃ vā, kiyatī tasya saṅkhyā” —iti puruṣalakṣanāṇi*…as in K1, better also because *saṅkhyā * is not part of *ākāra*. 

xxii *kurvanti rahasyaṃ rahasy aprakāśan * with K1, against the reading *rahasi kurvanti, na prakāśam * of the other witnesses, since they could have skipped the first *rahasyaṃ * or considered it as a dittography. 

xxiii *vandakādibhiḥ * with K1. 

xxiv *ayam eva sarvānumataṃ cāturvarṇyādi mahājanaḥ * with K1. Note that at p. 197, l.14 \(section 5.2.2.1\) there has already been a case of neutral-masculine concordance. 

xxv *dṛṣṭvā * in A and Mback, which could also fit the context, insofar as Dharmaśāstra texts claim that caṇḍālas are polluting just by seeing them. Thus, the change of *spṛṣṭvā * to *dṛṣṭvā * could be justified due to this background knowledge. 

xxvi *kimartham * with K1, also because Jayanta does not ever use *kimarthaḥ * as adj. 

xxviiAgainst - *viṣayeṣu*, as in K1, because *vivadante * is regularly used with a sg. in Jayanta. 

xxviii *āsthāśaithilya * as in K1. The same expression is used in *Nyāyakalikā*, Jhā 1925, p. 14, in the sense of loosing confidence: *anirākriyamāṇe ca tasmin tattvajñānāsthāśaithilyaṃ śiṣyāṇāṃ syād iti jalpavitaṇḍayor upadeśaḥ*. Similarly, in the present passage: in order to shake one’s confidence \[in oneself\], Buddhists teach that there is no self. 

xxixWithout *vā*, as in K1. 

xxx *dhāraṇa * as in K1. 

xxxi *viśeṣa * as in K1. 

xxxii *mati * as in K1, against the other witnesses and the version of this verse published in Śāstrī 1981, 1982, also because of the paraphrase with follows, and because *matibhedaḥ * is found in Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha’s version of this verse, which points to a different Kaśmīri transmission \( *Mokṣakārikāvṛtti * ad 147cd-148ab, in Dvivedī 1988\). 

xxxiii *bhavatu kāmaṃ*, against K1 because of the NMGBh, which confirms the presence of *kāmaṃ*. 

xxxivWe keep *hi*, as in K1, which might have been skipped by the other witnesses because of the following *hi * in *hiṃsā*. 

xxxv *khecarā*- with K1 against *khecaratā*-, since compounds such as *khecarādyaṣṭasiddhi * are commonly found in Śaiva texts. 

xxxvi *avaśyaṃbhavatīti * as in K1. 

xxxvii *apare * with K1. 

xxxviiiK1 reads *santaṃ saṃjñābhedān upagacchann * instead of *sa eva saṃjñābhedān upagacchati * of the other witnesses. 

Since *sa eva * is repeated also in the following sentence, K1’s reading could be the result of a previous reading, which could be better than the actual one but cannot be at present reconstructed. 

xxxix *ekakartṛtve * as in K1, whereas A1 and B1 have *ekakartṛkatve*. 

xl *tatkalpanāyām * as in K1, also because it better fits with the preceding statement. 

49

xliPlural as in K1. 

xlii *dākṣiṇya * with K1. *dākṣiṇya * is the skill to approach the opponent in a debate in a way which does not irritate him. 

On *dākṣiṇya * as a *vādālaṅkāra*, see Oberhammer, Prets, and Prandstetter 1996, s.v. 

xliii *idam * with K1. *iyad * is not necessary and has probably been influenced by *yāvad *\(which does not have a correlative\). 

xliv *saṃvarta * with K1 against *saṃvartaka*, hardly attested. 

xlv *pramāṇībhūte * without the following *sati*, as in K1, also because *sati * is not needed. 

xlvi *tantra * as in K1, in its meaning of *pradhāna*. *svatantra*, which is the reading of the other witnesses, seems an elucidation of it. Cf. *kiṃtantratā * at the end of NM 4, NM, p. 703, asking what is principal between Vedic statements pointing at something established \( *siddha*\) and Vedic statements teaching something to be done \( *sādhya*\): *kiṃtantratā*

*bhavati kasya tayor *|

xlviiwithout *tu * with K1, because this sentence is almost a gloss of the preceding one. 

xlviiiWe keep *yatkiṃcid *\(in compound with *āgamaṃ*\), thinking that K1’s *yaṃ kiṃcid * could be a case of hypercorrec-tion. Jayanta allows caesures at the end of a compound member, and not of whole words only. 

xlix- *vrataṃ kila*, as in K1, without *idaṃ *\(unmetrical\).
