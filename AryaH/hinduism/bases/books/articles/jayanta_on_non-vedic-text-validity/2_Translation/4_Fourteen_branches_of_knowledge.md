title = "4 Fourteen branches of knowledge"

In every case \(whichever position we take\), to begin with, these six branches of knowledge65

—i.e., the four Vedas, the Purāṇasvii and the Smṛtisviii— which directly teach the instruments to realise the human aim \(i.e., dharma, see immediately below\) are an instrument of knowledge in the ways \(i.e., of Mīmāṃsā or Nyāya\) said above. \[6\]

explain further whether this *viṣaya * refers to the meaning of the prescriptions or to the people enjoined by them \(Shah 1975-1992, p. 70\). 

63Cf. “Therefore, the conflict between Veda and recollected tradition is not really frequently seen” \( *tena naiva* *śrutismṛtyor virodho ’tīva dṛśyate*, TV ad 1.3.4, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 193, l.11\). Also the NMGBh mentions Kumārila as source for this claim \( *iti bhaṭṭa ācaṣṭe*, Shah 1972, p. 110\). Śabara does not make any explicit claim to this effect and rather states that in case of conflict the Veda invalidates the recollected tradition, see introductory study, section II.4.3. 

64On this verse, see Mehendale 2001, pp. 194-5, which discusses the meaning of this verse in its original context, i.e., the Veda \(in the original context: the fifth Veda, i.e., the Mahābhārata\) is thought to be too concise, and to require the help of secondary stories \( *upākhyāna*\) found in Purāṇas and Itihāsas. The same verse is also quoted in NM 1, section 3.1.3 of Kataoka 2007a. Shah has “he will transgress me” \( *ullaṃghaśe*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 71\). Bhattacharyya translates in a way which is grammatically possible, but makes less sense, since the role of the Purāṇas and Itihāsas in avoiding the unwanted consequence is not spelt out: “It has been stated that History and the Purāṇas should supplement the Vedas since the Vedas apprehend that the ignorant persons will lay blame on them” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 549\). 

65In NM 1, Śāstrārambha section, Jayanta explains the meaning of *sthāna * in *vidyāsthāna * as *upāya *‘means’

\( *vidyāsthānatvaṃ ca nāma caturdaśānāṃ śāstrāṇāṃ puruṣārthasādhanajñānopāyatvam evocyate*, Kataoka 2007a, p. 178\).

The six auxiliary sciences \(Vedāṅgas\) beginning with Grammar, by contrast, do not directly teach dharma, \[but\] they are useful to \[the first six branches\] exactly insofar as they are a subordinate member \( *aṅga*\) \[of them\]. Even the Kalpasūtras \[against what you might think66\], do not teach something non-precedented \( *apūrva*\), they are only a compendium of restrictions regarding the sequence of scattered ritual actions \(i.e., the Kalpasūtras explain in which sequence one should perform ritual actions which are prescribed in different passages of the Veda\).67\[12\]

The Mīmāṃsā consists in a reflection on the meaning of the Vedic sentences \(i.e., it does not directly teach dharma\). \[13\] The elaboration of reasoning \(i.e., the Nyāya system\)68 is the cause of the ascertainment of the validity of the Veda, as has been said already in the prologueix \( *āmukha*\) \(i.e., in the Śāstrārambha section\). \[14\]

Therefore, it is established that these fourteen branches of knowledge are an instrument of knowledge, some insofar as they directly teach \[the means for realising the human aim, i.e., dharma\], some insofar as they are useful \[to the former\].
