## 3.1 Nyāya view

Also the validity of Itihāsas and Purāṇas has to be understood as ascertained by the same

\[argument\] \(i.e., insofar as they have been composed by a reliable author, like Manu\). In fact, the Itihāsas and Purāṇas are said to be the fifth Veda \(thus, their validity depends on the fact that they have a reliable author, just like the validity of the Veda depends on its author\). And it has been said:

One should complete the Veda through the Itihāsas and Purānas |

The Veda fears the ignorant \( *alpaśruta*\) one: “He will cross over me \[too rush-ingly\] \[if I am not supplemented by Purāṇas and Itihāsas\]\!” ||64 \(Sukthankar, Belvalkar, and Vaidya 1933-1971, 1.1.204\)

## 3.2 Mīmāṃsā view

Else, \[a different opinion could be:\] What is the use of \[this\] attachment \( *abhiniveśa*\)v \[to the Naiyāyika view\]? \[We could accept the Mīmāṃsaka view instead, namely:\] Because the recollected tradition is based on the Veda \[and is hence valid\], also the Purāṇa is an instrument of knowledgevi like the recollected tradition \(i.e., insofar as it is based on the Veda\). 

At least \( *tāvat*\), there is no dispute as for \[their\] validity. Also the practice of good people, which is not textual, should be valid only because it is based on the Veda.
