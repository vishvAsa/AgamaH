title = "5 Texts other than the fourteen branches of knowledge"

+++

As for the other sacred texts \( *āgama*\) one sees \[in the world\], these are of two kinds as well69. 

Some, like the Buddhist \[Texts\], behave completely in conflict with the Veda. Some, like the Śaiva \[Texts\], teach, without contradicting the Veda, different observances, which one can opt for \[instead of the Vedic ones\].70

## 5.1 Validity of texts which do not criticise the Veda

### 5.1.1 Mīmāṃsā-based arguments and argument out of partial agreements
 Among these \[two types of texts\], to begin with, we shall speak of the validity of the Śaiva sacred texts, etc., since one does not grasp in regard to the notion produced by them doubt, subsequent invalidation, and defects of the causes \[of cognition\]x \( *kāraṇadoṣa*\).71 For also in their regard, through recollected tradition and inference, it is established that they have been authored by the Lord, since it is impossible to postulate a root other \[than the Lord’s perception\], such as greed or delusion. In fact, in their case no \[human\] origin is remembered,72 and 66This point might oppose a general feeling that the Śrautasūtras do teach dharma. Jayanta replies that they only repeat and rearrange Vedic rules. The Kalpasūtras are treated separately although they are part of the six Vedāṅgas in order to answer this objection. 

67Alternatively, the compound could be interpreted as a *dvandva*: “a compendium of restrictions, sequences and ritual actions which were scattered \[in the Vedas\]”. 

68In Jayanta the term *nyāyavistara * seems to denote the Nyāya system, cf. NM 1, section Śāstrārambha: “With the word *nyāyavistara * this very system is called. \[The compound is analysed in this way:\] that \[system\] in which the *nyāya*, i.e. the reasoning, the inference, is expounded” \( *nyāyavistaraśabdenaitad eva śāstram ucyate. nyāyas tarko*

*’numānam, so ’sminn eva vyutpādyate*, Kataoka 2007a, p. 177, with *vistara * glossed by *vyutpādyate*\). On *nyāyavistara* see also Preisendanz 2010, pp. 33-37. 

69Just like the two-fold partition of texts into directly teaching and auxiliary ones explained a few lines above. 

70Optional, i.e., one either performs the Śaiva ones or the Vedic ones \(see the introductory study, section II.4.3\). 

NMGBh comments: “For it is not the case that in the Śaiva and in other similar \[sacred texts\] the performance of the \[sacred text’s\] own practices is praised by despising the performance of the Vedic ones” \( *na hi śaivādau* *vaidikānuṣṭhānanindādvāreṇa svakīyacarīyānuṣṭhānapraśaṃsā*\). In other words, both Buddhists and Śaivas prescribe different rites, but the latter do not criticise the Veda. Moreover, they keep at least part of the Vedic injunctions \(in particular the four classes and the four stages of life, see below §5.1.1\). Following the reading of Jayanta Bhaṭṭa 1895-1896 and NM, Bhattacharyya reads *kalpita*- instead of *vaikalpika*- and translates “\[…\] they teach new rites which have been suggested by them”, with no gloss on the ambiguous “them”, which possibly refers to the Vedas \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 550\). Shah also reads *kalpita*-, and just repeats the term in Gujarātī \(Shah 1975-1992, p. 72\). 

71On the causes of invalidity, see the introductory study, section II.4.2.1 and table 6. 

72See also next fn., connecting this lack of recollection to the preceding sentence. Shah, by contrast, understands this as an evidence of beginninglessness, just like in the case of the Veda and adds the following explanation: “That 34

partial agreements \[with actual state of affairs\] \(as for visible items, such as remedies against snakes\), like in the case of the Veda, are generally experienced.73

Therefore, how could there be room for postulating a different root? Nor do they take the position \( *avasthāna*\) of opposing the Veda, since the usages of the four classes \( *varṇa*\), etc., which are well-establishedxi, are not abandoned \[in the Śaiva texts\].74

Although the argument \( *nyāya*\) \[which proves that\] the \[texts\] by Manu, etc. are

\[based\] on a Vedic injunction75 does not apply |

to the Śaiva Texts \[which cannot be based on the Veda, since they explicitly claim to have been uttered by God\], nonetheless their validity \[remains\] correct ||76 because: 1\) the contents of the Upaniṣadsxii \(e.g., knowledge of the self77\), which refer78 to the level of the Ultimate \( *niḥśreyasa*\), |

appear to be investigated \( *vivicyamāna*\) time and again there \(in the Śaiva Texts\) ||

2\) and Kṛṣṇadvaipāyaṇa \(Vyāsa\), etc., who are the foremost ones among the knowers of the Veda, |

also agree79 that the Śaiva and the other \[similar\] views are valid80 ||

The same \[knowers of the Veda\]xiii described in detail also the validity of the Pañcarātras |81

because also in their regard there is no occasion for invalidity \(i.e., doubt, subsequent invalidation and defects of the cause\) ||

is, the Śaiva sacred texts are without beginning” \( *arthāt śaiv āgamo anādi che*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 72\). The lack of a remembered origin does in fact evoke a Mīmāṃsā argument \(see next fn.\), but here it is rather used as an evidence of a Divine origin of the Vedas. 

73Therefore, the “recollection” mentioned above is just this absence of recollection, whereas the inference mentioned above is this one regarding the agreement with reality, which works like the agreement of Veda and Āyurveda \(the latter can be checked and the validity of the former is inferred out of it\), see introductory study, section II.4.1. 

The idea of the lack of recollection working as an *argumentum e silentio * may derive from ŚBh ad 1.1.5, where it is stated that if a person had really invented language, she would have certainly been remembered \(cf., for instance, 

“For if a person had created the connection \[between words and meanings\] and then started linguistic communica-tion, he would certainly be remembered every time one speaks”, *yadi hi puruṣaḥ kṛtvā saṃbandhaṃ vyavahārayet,* *vyavahārakāle ’vaśyaṃ smartavyo bhavet*, Frauwallner 1968, p. 44, ll.2-4\). 

74Versus the opinion upheld in the ĀḌ, Dezső 2005, p. 194, see also the introductory study, section II.2. 

75This elliptic expression refers to the verse by Kumārila quoted above, end of section 2.1.1.2. 

76 Shah strongly emphasises this verse and understands it as saying that “the texts included here \[namely Śaiva and Pāñcarātra ones\] are all authentic, though not as authentic as the texts of Manu etc. The reservation thus made is noteworthy. For the deities like Śiva, Viṣṇu etc. which were the presiding deities of sects like Śaiva, Pāñcarātra etc. were so obviously Purāṇic deities, and so these sects were so obviously sub-sects among the Purāṇists. Hence when Jayanta says that the scriptural texts belonging to these sub-sects are not as authentic as the texts of Manu etc. 

he can only mean that Dharmaśāstras and Purāṇas are acceptable to all Purāṇists without exception while these texts are acceptable only to this or that sub-sect among the Purāṇists” \(Shah 1992-97, p. 16\). 

77The referent of *upaniṣadarthāḥ * is not clear. Since it is plural, it cannot indicate the single liberation, but it might indicate the various means to reach it. Shah repeats the Sanskrit construction with Gujarātī *tatsām * words, without adding any explanation \( *upaniṣadānā, niḥśreya-padane sparśatā je arthā*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 72\). 

78 *spṛś*- is not completely clear. Bhattacharyya: “\[…\] they are saturated with the teaching of the Upaniṣads which point to final emancipation” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, pp. 550–1\). Shah repeats *sparśatā *\(Shah 1975-1992, p. 72\). 

79On the Mīmāṃsā \(particularly Prābhākara\) use of the agreement of great people see Śālikanātha’s quote in the introductory study, section II.4.2. 

80NMGBh refers to a passage of the Mahābhārata: “O supreme sovereign, you must know these notions and the various opinions \[represented in them\]: the Pāñcarātra, the Sāṅkhya, the Vedas, as well as the Pāśupata” \( *pañcarātraṃ*

*ca sāṅkhyaṃ ca vedāḥ pāśupataṃ tathā | jñānāny etāni rājendra viddhi nānā matāni ca*, Sukthankar, Belvalkar, and Vaidya 1933-1971, 12.337.59\).

### 5.1.2 Nyāya-based arguments: God as author

And there \(in the Pāñcarātras\) the revered Viṣṇu is said to be the author. And he is no one but the Lord. 

A single special person without beginning, who is the cause of the production of all the worlds \[and\] has supernatural powers, |

is known as Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Rudra, because of \[his\] association with the parts of his task, which are creation, duration and destruction ||82

Also in the Veda, here and there it is recited \[of\] Rudra and \[of\] Viṣṇu: “There is only one Rudra, no second one”, “Viṣṇu strode over the \[entire universe, i.e., the three worlds\]

\(Ṛgveda 1.22.17, Sontakke and Kashikar 1951-1983\)”.83 And the sacrificesxiv to them, namely, the means to please them are enjoined also in the Veda. The Śaiva and Pañcarātra texts, by contrast, teach the same sacrificesxv to the \[Lord\] in a way different \[than the Vedic one\]. Nor does this contradict the Veda, since the means are liable to option. Therefore, since they have been composed by a reliable \[author\] and since they do not contradict the Veda, both \(Śaiva and Pañcarātra texts\) are not invalid. 

## 5.2 Invalidity of the other texts

By contrast, the sacred texts of the Buddhists, of the “Liberators from the saṃsāra”, etc.xvi teach the practice of sinfulxvii \[people\]: Which noble person would agree with theirxviii validity? 

### 5.2.1 Mīmāṃsā-based arguments: they are outside the Veda

#### 5.2.1.1 Practices which are outside the Veda

For, in the case of the Buddhist sacred texts, it is patent that they are outside the Veda |

because they restrict84 themselves to just shun \( *parihāra*\) the practice adequate for one’s class’ \( *jāti*\) dharma ||85

#### 5.2.1.2 Practices prohibited by the Veda

The sinful Liberators from the saṃsāra, intent at \[inflicting\] violence on living beings, |

82 *vasantatilakā * metre. The same verse is found in the ĀḌ, where it ends with *prasiddhiḥ * instead of *pratītiḥ*:

“Because of his association with the elements of his task, namely creations, maintenance and dissolutions, the unique, wonderful, unborn, supremely powerful Person, who is the cause of the emission of the whole world, is known as Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra” \(Dezső 2005, p. 225\). The source could be the Viṣṇupurāṇa: “The Lord attains the denomination of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva out of \[his\] creating, maintaining or destroying \[the world\], \[but\] he is the same single Janārdana” \( *sṛṣṭisthityantakaraṇād brahmaviṣṇuśivātmikām | sa saṃjñāṃ yāti bhagavān eka eva* *janārdana*, Pathak 1997-1999, 1.2.63\)

83We could find the first quote *verbatim * in Nirukta 1.15 \(see Sarup 1984\) \(the same passage is also quoted by Rāmakaṇṭha and by Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha\). Its closest Vedic source is in Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1.8.6.1 \( *eka eva rudro na* *dvitīyāya tasthe*\). Shah indicates “Atha. 3” as source \(Shah 1975-1992, p. 73\). 

84 *avadhāraṇa * in the sense of *eva*, in order to distinguish the Buddhist position from the Śaiva one, which leaves the option open. 

85The Buddha, though a kṣatriya by birth, took the dharma of another *jāti * and became a teacher, as if he were a brahman. 

36

act because of delusion only.86 Therefore, their sacred texts are not an instrument of knowledge ||87

Whose tongue could engage in telling the validity in regard to a \[sacred text\]xix |

in which a ritual action is taught, which aims at the religious practice \( *sevana*\) of something prohibited?88 ||

Even if sometime, somewhere, someone would achieve a realisation due to such

\[a religious practice\],89 |

this would only lead to Hell, like the sensual enjoyment obtained through the murder of a brahman90 ||

How could a sin obtained due to the practice of something prohibited be allayed? |

therefore, even at a later time, one would fall back91 in hell ||

### 5.2.2 Nyāya-based arguments: there is no agreement of the great people
By contrast, as for what has been asked \(at the beginning, section 1\) in this regard, i.e., “What can be replied to the others who try to postulate that the Buddha, etc., are reliable, through the sequence \( *krama*\) \[of the arguments\] seen above \(e.g., insofar as the Buddha is also a reliable speaker, there are no causes of invalidity, etc.\)?”, one must give the \[following\] reply. In fact, it is easy to say that \[a sacred text\] has been uttered by a reliable \[speaker\] if \[the fact of having a reliable speaker\] is assisted by the general opinion of the exemplary people, \[but\]

not otherwise. And an exemplary person accepts the validity of the Vedas, of the Purāṇas and Dharmaśāstras, which follow the Veda, and of some sacred texts \( *āgama*\) which do not contradict the Veda, \[but\] not of the Buddhist texts, etc., which contradict the Veda. Therefore, how could these have been composed by a reliable author? For in their case it is easy to say that they had a different root, such as ignorance and greed. With these arguments the Buddhists, etc., which compete with the Veda, must be objected to. 

#### 5.2.2.1 Definition of great person 
It is said \[as an objection\]: Please, explain: Who is this “exemplary person”? How does he look? By whom is he instantiated \( *āspada*\)?92 How many \[exemplary people\] are there? How does he behave? 

86The reference is to JS 1.3.4, see introductory study, section II.4.2 and table 5. 

87Bhattacharyya does not take into account the distinction between practices external to the Veda and practices prohibited by the Veda. Furthermore, *saṃsāramocaka * is not recognised as the designation of a specific group: “The Buddhist saints who are indifferent to the worldly pleasures are addicted to animal slaughter. So their conscience is clouded. Hence their scriptures are not true” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 551\). 

88NMGBh explains that blood, dead \[bodies\] and bloody fat are considered to be purifying by the adepts of the Bhairava Tantra. 

89Shah does not take into account the distinction between practices external to the Veda and practices prohibited by the Veda and glosses “A prohibited ritual act taught in the sacred texts of the Buddhists, etc.” \( *bauddhādi āgamoe* *upadeśelā niṣiddh karmothī*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 74\). 

90The hint is probably to the case of one who kills a brahman and then enjoys a sexual intercourse with the brahman’s wife. This sin will lead him to hell. Similarly, Saṃsāramocakas kill living beings, obtain through that realisations \( *siddhi*\), such as flying \(so the NMGBh\), and then go to hell. If we want to keep the parallelism, it cannot be that killing itself is pleasant, there must be an intermediate step between killing and hell. 

91Neither Shah nor Bhattacharya translate this slightly problematic *punaḥ *\(Shah 1975-1992, p. 74; Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 552\). 

92 *āspada * is a technical term indicating the object of a dispute \( *vivāda*\), etc. and can be glossed by *āśraya*. Shah interprets *āspada * as “rank” \( *yogyatā*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 75\). In his English translation, instead, he translates thus:

“What its name” \(Shah 1992-97, p. 18\). Bhattacharyya just skips it \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 552\). 

37

Moreover, thexx Buddhists, etc., insist —in order to establish the validity of their own Texts \( *āgama*\)— that the Buddha, etc., are reliable \[speakers\]. They could also claim, in order to establish this \[validity\], that a Buddhist monk \( *vandaka*\), etc., is their own “exemplary person”.93 What would you counterargue in this case? 

\[R.:\] It must be said: He is called an “exemplary person” who belongs to the four classes and the four stages of life \[and\] is well-known in this country where the noblest people live \(Āryadeśa\). By contrast, “How is his appearance?”, “How are his hands and feet or head and neck?”,“What is their number?”: We cannot enumerate these characteristics of \[exemplary\]

people.xxi94

#### 5.2.2.2 This great person is accepted also by Buddhists, etc. 
And this exemplary person, i.e. \[a person who belongs to\] the four classes and the four stages of life, cannot be refuted by those who uphold other sacred texts since he acts following the Vedic path \[which are even for them the basis of ethics, see immediately below\]. To elaborate: also these wicked Buddhists, etc., are disciplined \[in their behaviour because of assuming\] the validity of the Veda: they avoid the contact of a *caṇḍāla*, and of other \[untouchables\]. \[This is an evidence of the fact that they also respect the Veda\] because once one has refuted the pride in casteism,95 what is wrong in touching a caṇḍāla, etc.? And also these others96 who perform what should not be done, in the form of an initiation that does not distinguish \[pure and impure\]97 —which starts with eating impure \[substances\] \( *aśuci*\) and approaching \[women\] which should not be approached \(i.e., close relatives\)— even they perform this secretxxii action in secret, not openly, since they are afraid of the exemplary people, \[who belong\] to the four classes, etc. 

\[This is an evidence of the fact that they also respect the Veda\] because, if they would believe in their sacred texts without any doubt, why should they perform their contents like thieves \(namely, in secret\)? 

For this very reason, Buddhist monks \(i.e. Buddhists\), etc.,xxiii cannot set up their own exemplary person. Rather, this alone is the exemplary person who \[belongs\] to the four classes, etc., \[and\] is accepted by all.xxiv

#### 5.2.2.3 The Vedic model is accepted also by Buddhists, etc. 
And this exemplary person utterly refutes the Texts which contradict the Veda, he does not sympathise with them. 

After having touchedxxv a Liberator from the saṃsāra, educated people \( *śiṣṭa*\) take a bath with their clothes on \(because their clothes also need to be purified\) |

also with the Buddhists, they do not have any intercourse ||

93Bhattacharyya makes an addition which does not seem to be justified by the Sanskrit text: “\[…\] the Buddhists

\[…\] may also add that they have got their own authoritative persons and that their number is roughly a hundred crores” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 552\). 

94Bhattacharyya separates the questions and considers the last remark as only an answer to the latter question, although this interpretation does not seem to be supported by the term *puruṣalakṣaṇāni*: “\[…\] how do his head and neck look like? \(Our simple answer is this that all his limbs bear a close resemblance to those of a human being\). 

The number of these authoritative persons is so vast that is beyond the scope of human calculations” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, pp. 552–3\). 

95The NMGBh explains that this is the pride one feels while uttering “I am a brahman”, and then refers to Dharmakīrti’s *Pramāṇavārttikasvavṛtti*, Gnoli 1960, p. 173, where this pride is listed among the five marks of stupidity. 

96The NMGBh explains: “The Nāthavādas, etc. Likewise it is said: “It is reported that the Nātha said that ‘One can have intercourse with \[one’s\] mother, \[one’s\] sister, just like with another female member of one’s own clan, but not with a different \[type of woman\]’ ” \( *nāthavādādayaḥ. yathāhuḥ —mātā ca bhaginī caiva tathānyā yā svagotrajā |*

*gamyāparā tv agamyeti nātha evaṃ kilābravīt ||*, Shah 1972, p. 114\). We could not locate any further information on these Nāthavādas. 

97For *nirvikalpa * meaning “Without hesitation as to the use of impure substances” see Goodall and Rastelli forthcoming s.v. \(we are thankful to Somdev Vasudeva for this information\). Shah only transliterates into Gujarātī \(Shah 1975-1992, p. 75\). Bhattacharyya writes: “initiation into the mystic intuition of incomprehensible Reality” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 553\). 

38

And almost every person follows the Vedic dharma |

any Text which is outside the Veda is, by contrast, only a fraud ||

And it is this highly distinguished collection of texts called the Veda, whose majesty is not shared by any other \[text\], that others, supporters of texts external \[to the Veda\], compete with by \[adopting\] \[its\] very way. For when they claim the validity of their own texts, they denote \[it\] in the same way as \[that of\] the Veda. In one way or the other they attempt to enter into the Veda \(i.e., to have their texts reach the same dignity98\). Here and there they put down Vedic contents99 in their own texts.100 They consider themselves purified by the contact of the Veda. Even for them, in their hearth, the validity of the Veda shines strongly. Thus, these other texts have not been composed by a reliable \[author\], because one does not see in their regard such a general opinion \( *prasiddhi*\) on the part of the exemplary people. 

#### 5.2.2.4 If the agreement of the exemplary people is enough, what is the purpose of
 **Nyāya? **It is said \[by an Obj.\]:

Since the ascertainment of the validity of the Veda is done through the general opinion of the exemplary people only |

whyxxvi should a noble person dry up his throat for so long \(talking about it\)? ||

For \[you\] say that this \[Nyāya-\]system \( *śāstra*\) has been undertaken for the sake of establishing the validity of the Veda. But since the validity of the Veda is established through the general opinion of the exemplary people, what is the use of the system? 

\[R.:\] Enough with such low criticisms\! 

For some even spread doubts about the general opinion of the exemplary people |

therefore, \[this\] system is needed as a weapon in order to hit at them ||

Therefore, it is established that only the texts mentioned above are valid, not the ones which are external to the Veda.
