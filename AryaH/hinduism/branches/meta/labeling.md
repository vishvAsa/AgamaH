## Avoid hair-splitting
With regards to distinctions such as "Astika/ nAstika", "dvaitin/ advaitin", "saguNa/ nirguNa", "only one Atman which is expressed differently in different bodies vs many Atman-s" etc..,  unless you are truly initiated learned and committed to a tradition, we suggest that you honestly pride yourself for being a unqualified, generic (nirvishiShTa) hindu with an open mind. Speculation should be freely admitted where necessary; and the advaita / dvaita etc.. points of view (darshana-s) should be used and discarded as necessary, like therapy.
