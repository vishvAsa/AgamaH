## Rk change
R^ik for for wealth

यन् नो अग्निर् अखनद् यन् न इन्द्रो  
विश्वे यद् देवा मरुतः स्वर्का ।  
तद् अस्मभ्यं सविता सत्यधर्मा  
सरस्वत्य् अनुमतिर् नि यच्छात् ॥

यन् न इन्द्रो अखनद् यद् अग्निर्  
विश्वे देवा मरुतो यत् स्वर्काः ।  
तद् अस्मभ्यं सविता सत्यधर्मा  
*प्रजापतिर्* अनुमतिर् नि यछात् ॥

These R^ik-s for wealth (usually understood as mined) are respectively from AV-paippalAda & AV-vulgate. In AV-P the deities invoked are agni, indra, marut-s, savitR^i, sarasvati & anumati.  
In AV-vul sarasvatI is replaced by prajApati.

This is the phenomenon of "prAjApatyization" wherein in multiple instances a distinct deity from the older standard pantheon in the AV-P is replaced by prajApati in the AV-vul. It illustrates how old R^ik-s can be changed in situ to incorporate a new religious trend. Now think of this process in the rAmAyaNa.

## Boar and turtle
The Prājāpatya-s competed with Viṣṇu for the two figures of the primordial turtle Kaśyapa and the primordial boar Varāha.  

While the former was originally associated with Indra (from the RV itself), the latter is hinted to be associated with Viṣṇu in the early AV tradition recorded in the Paippalāda-saṃhitā. However, the Prājāpatya-s laid a strong claim to both before Viṣṇu +++(bhaktas)+++ eventually won and claimed both the figures as his avatāra-s in the Post-Vedic period."
