Many people are uncomfortable with a religion having multiple simultaneous registers, i.e., 

1. the shautra/ekAgni = vaidika practice; 
2. the vaidika-colored smArta/paurANika practice; 
3. the tAntrika practices of different sects; grAmya or AraNyaka folk practices. 
   

One who has penetrated the depths of the dharma (tattvAvesha) is comfortable with serially practicing these registers without being affected by the apparent distinctions or contradictions in the layers. 

For example, he is simultaneously conscious and unperturbed by the fact that gajamukha vinAyaka is a late deity and not in the shruti.  
He is not worked up the effusive elevation of one deity in one register as opposed to another.  

Even greater is one who sees the unifying structure across these registers and has an ontology to apprehend that. It is not the first time such issues have come to the fore in our tradition. 

The great makhin, bhAskararAya, was one such who apprehended and practiced across registers at the highest level.

Counter religions - They break that basic thread of unity; hence a counter-religion.
