While the ingredients for the superlative position of naam-vaad were already present in pre 13th century agama-purana literature, I believe we see a massive third movement emerging in the pancharatrikas(and adjacents) going full blown by the 16th century wrecking the post.

Matsyendra world of yogin-s and rasasiddhas that itself emerged in a similar superlative positioning of hathayoga over mantramarga. 

This new layer visible in positioning ram naam as the only true rasayana in jnaneshwar and naamdev's world quickly expands to a pan ramanandi order of sectarian narratives where ram naam japakas are crushing yogins in contests of magic-  

- krishnadas payohari ji seizes galta from a yogin, 
- Kabir's daughter kamali outshines gorakhnath floating in the skies over multan by the virtue of drinking from ramnami 
- Ravidas's pitcher

Numerous other bhagats shame and outshine the siddhis attained by the hathayogins in favour of ram naam. 

## shAnkarans
Comparable is the trajectory of this movement going full blown in the advaitns by madhusudan's time  
and the constitution of the dashnami order that retained elements from their previous world to varying degrees. 

One may argue some anti scholastic naama paratva literature attributed to adi Shankara emerged precisely in this post 13th century revolution in the advaitin yati realm.

The nAga sAdhu-s are dashanAmi advaitin-s by origin and have multiple yoga akhADa-s. Some dashanAmi-s from the north also perform the old kaula yoga of khecharI mudra.

In terms of pAta~njala yoga, shaMkara himself wrote the pAta~njala-yogashAstra-vivaraNa; of course, it was not physical yoga emphasized by later dashanami traditions.

I've heard that northern advaitins, especially those centred around places like Haridvār continue to heavily emphasize the yoga aspect over viveka aspect to this day. You might have come across the derisive phrase "puriñjāl pōdum vedāntam" to refer to the viveki type approach.  

Surprisingly, some of the vocal advaitins of TN (who are arguably not associated with traditional institutions) seem to have a very different split compared to their northern counterparts. The yoga-māraga oriented folks (as examplified by Śrī Kṛṣṇapremī??) swear by the nāma-mārga of Śrī Bodhendra Sarasvatī while the Vivekī pakṣa (epitomised by the likes of Dayanand Sarasvati and Omkārānanda) seem to have been somewhat dismissive of both

## Sikh impact
A memory of the strong hathayogic impressions that succeeded their original world but a very faint impression of the ramnami world that this preceded, in the advaitin realm, probably birthed the Udasis. 

This also gives us a clear clue to the fundamental point of contention between nanakpanthi sikhs and shrichandi udasis,  
an affiliation with the third and second layers of religion respectively, with sikh theology being a consequence of the superlative position of naam dismissing vaidika mantramargiya and hathayogic methods in the advaitin realm.

## Conclusion
Hence, I believe these three layers crystallised in the three different schools in the advaitin realm of dandi sanyasis, udasis and sikhs with dashnami sublineages distributed across all three. The third layer pervaded nath sublineages too but minimally I believe.
