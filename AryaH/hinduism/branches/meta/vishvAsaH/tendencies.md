## Dislikes
- excessive contempt for the veda-s (some bauddha-s, sIkhs, jaina-s)
- excessive non-violent tendencies, or focus on asceticism (jaina-s, pAtanjala-yogins)
- crass materialism (characteristic of some [chArvAka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charvaka)s/ lOkAyatas), which mirrors modern reactionary atheism
            
## Likes
- Rich artistic rituals
  - Eg- Agama-s, tAntrika bauddha-s. 
- Emphasis on compassion.
  - Eg- jaina-s, bauddha-s
- Aesthetic emphasis
  - Artistic folks tend to admire the [AlankArika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_aesthetics)-s (aestheticians); who reveled in poetry and the arts; and attempted to understand and articulate life as an aesthetic experience.
