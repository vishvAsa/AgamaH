PREFACE. 

I have attempted in the following pages to explain the Tarkasamgraha so as to bring it within an easy reach of the understanding of an average student. I leave it to the proper authorities to judge how far the attempt has succeeded. While acknowledging the valuable help I received from earlier annotators of the manual and its allied works I may point out that I have ventured to differ from them on certain topics. The supposed subjectivity of Kanada's Samanya and Visheshi, the genesis of Samavaya and the fallacy of Asatpratipaksha are some of the topics wherein I have proposed new inter- pretations which I take to be more convincing. Some of such discussions I have put within brackets because I thought the average student could very well do without reading them. 

The deep knowledge of the subject of my brother Nyayashastri Bhawanishankar Sukthankar, Medallist in Nyaya, stooa me in good stead He helped me to solve not a few problems in Nyaya. Prof P. V. Kulkarni, of the Elphinstone College, from whom I received my first lessons in Nyaya has obliged me by going through the major part of the manuscript and by making many valuable suggestions. Prof. V. A Gadgil of the Wilson College, Prof. Shembavnekar of the St, Xavier's College, Prof. Suru of the Fergussion College and Profes- sors Adnık iri and Shinde of the Rajaram College, have laid me under a døbt of obligation by suggesting the lines on which the book was to be written. It was indeed my supreme privilege to be encouraged heartily by all these scholars in my first venture. 

• 

Mr. Mohite the manager of the Aryabhanu Press is to be thanked for undertaking the printing of this book Even when there was heavy pressure of work and for executing it with the utmost despatch. I cannot help acknowledging the enthusiastic care and initiative that Mr. Kokate their competent printer showed in giving the bock its nice get-up. 

Last but not least, I have to thank Mr. Dewool kar the Manager, Bombay Book-Depot, who undertook the publication of the edition in spite of other heavy commit- ments.

INTRODUCTION. 

[[1]]

Origin of the न्याय and वैशेषिक systems:- 

It is interesting to see how minds of men of countries so distant as India and Greece have progressed from one sphere of thought to another, on very similar lines. If in Greece the philosophy of Plato preceded and paved, in some degree, the way for the logic and metaphysics of Aristotle, in India, the philosophy of the Upanishads was the precursor of the rationalistic metaphysics of and the logic of , both of which could be said to be, to some extent, at least, its outcome. 

गौतम, 

The 

This coincidence is not by mere chance. transition from philosophy to logic and reasoning is the direct outcome of the tendency of the human mind to revert back to ratiocination as a reaction from an extreme faith in intuition, presupposed by philosophy. The philosophy of the Upanishads always made an appeal to intuition. If you want to realise the truth you will do so only by intuition, was the teaching of the Upanishads. No amount of reasoning, no scepticism, no logic could reveal the truth to you. नैषा सर्केण मतिरापनेया, says the काठक Upanishad.

Introduction. 

All these are typical of the predominant spirit of the Upanishads. They made a consistent appeal to intuition. 

Intuition and ecstasy are the privilege of a few only. They are doors that are positively shut to the majority of men. The emphasis on intuition. 

carried too far is bound to result in a reaction against itself. Logic and metaphysics are within the reach of each and every man with some aptitude at least to think. So, it is quite natural that not long after the Upanishadic philosophy must have come into vogue the extreme materialism of the लोकायतिकs. कणाद and the गौतम came into the field to strike the golden mean between the two extremes. If the period stands as a reaction of the orthodox faith against Buddhism, as Max Muller says, it is quite natural that the सूत्रs of कणाद and गौतम represent an attempt check the extreme materialistic tendency of the ass by diluting it with an admission of the authority the Vedas. 

That the 

and the 

systems originally 

attempted to bring about a harmony between the orthodox philosophy dependent upon intuition and the school of thought standing for extreme materialism will be clear from certain topics dis- cussed in the सूत्रs of गौतम and कणाद कणाद establishes the authority of the Veda in several 

s (Cp.6.1.1;

Introduction. 

2,3,4;10.2.9.) He praises in 6, 2.1 which he specifically describes as including as, s etc. But it is interesting to see how he repudiates the view of the Upanishads that our bodies are composed of three-some say five-elements and establishes, in the wise of a rationalist, not caring for tradition, that they are made of one element only ( 4. 2. 1.). His condemnation of a vicious Brahman ( 6 1.6, 7, 8. ), his conclusion that souls are many (3.2.20 ), in the teeth of the Upanishadic doctrine that plurality is mere Unity and that there is one self only ( 3. 2. 19. ) are all typical of the spirit for which ar's system stands. 

The same tendency is to be observed in 's न्यायसूत्र Like कणाद he has the highest respect for the Vedic tradition; (2.1.67.)he defends the Veda against objections like those of कौस in the निरुक्त (1:2.56-60); he believes in . But he has the honour to differ 

from the Vedic tradition whenever it came into conflict with reason. Thus, like, he believes, on grounds of reason, that our bodies are made of one element only, (3. 1. 28.) though here he points how reasoning (3. 1. 30) is supported by certain allusions in the as (3.1.29) That he differs from the extreme materialist is clear from his refutation of their view that the body is the self (3.1..4.) The upshot of the whole is that these systems want to differ

from the where it conflicted with reason; and to adhere to it where its doctrines did not clash with reason-because only thus could they make their systems popular by an appeal to the orthodox sentiment. 

This theory will account for the fact that while there are some who regard the न्याय-वैशेषिक systems as closely related to the 

a subdi- 

vision of the 

according to , there are others who regard it as an ad. As appealing to reason they were लौकायतिकs and they were आस्तिक because they appealed to the Vedic authority also. 

The above discussion will enable us to judge the relation between the न्याय-वैशेषिक दर्शन and the वेदान्त. Both accepted reasoning as a valuable means to knowledge but differed in the relative value they attached to it. Thus while the a does recognize the validity of reasoning, it gives its verdict in favour of a when there is a conflict between y and . The attaches value to reasoning in so far as the latter is in harmony with the . When आरुणि directs श्वेतकेतु to perform the various exp- eriments [ उदके लवणमवाधाय मा प्रातरुपसीदथाः ] when he says, यथा सौम्यैकेन मृत्पिण्डेन सर्वे मृण्मयं विज्ञातं, or when the गीता describes the ब्रह्मसूत्रपदs as हेतुमद्भिः all attach value to reasoning. But they want to assign to it

Introduction. 

a position lower than the when, for instance, काठक says नैषा सर्केण मतिरापनेया. The न्यायवैशेषिक attitude is quite the opposite. As seen above they will shelve 

when it conflicts with reasoning and admit its authority when it is in harmony with the latter.

The वैशेषिकs: -- These are the followers of कणाद the author of the . The name has been variously explained. Some say that the system got its name from the category of . But this view does not possess sufficient force in view of the fact that f was not the only category peculiar to the school, समवाय, for instance, being an equally important inn- ovation introduced by them. That this derivation has not the sanction of tradition behind it is obvious from the one suggested by the न्यायकोशकार who derives it thus 

विशेषं पदार्थभेदमधिकृत्य कृतो प्रन्थो वैशेषिकम् । 

i.e. the work which concerns itself with the defferent- iation of categories. अभ्यङ्करशास्त्रिन् in his commentary on the सर्वदर्शनसङ्ग्रह advances a similar explanation. द्रव्यगुणादिभेदेन सप्तैव पदार्था इति निश्चित्य सर्व सुव्यवस्थितं कणादः प्रत्यपादयत् । अत ईदृशं विशेषमुद्दिश्य प्रवृत्तत्वादिदं वैशेषिकशास्त्रमिति गीयते । 

-- स. द. स. औलुक्यदर्शन (p. 210 ) This interpretation is plainly enough based on the words साधर्म्यवैधर्म्याभ्यां in the introductory सूत्र of कणाद धर्मविशेषप्रसूताद्रव्य गुणकर्मसामान्यविशेषसमवायानां पदार्थाना साधर्म्य- वैधर्म्याभ्यां तत्वज्ञानाभिःश्रेयसम् ।

Whether the members were five or ten, it is beyond doubt that thes got their name from their syllogistic reasoning. That this is not a mere conjecture but a fact becomes evident from the examination of the history of the word न्याय. न्याय is genetically a term of the air system and denoted the upshot of the ratiocination employed in reconciling apparently

Vedic literature, 

particularly the Brahmanas. This is the import of the definition of the न्याय of the पूर्वमीमांसा. 

वेदार्थनिर्णयसाधनं अधिकरणात्मकः पदार्थः भाषापरिच्छेद. 

Thus there are न्यायs in the पूर्वमीमांसा like ' सविशेषणे हि वर्तमानौ विधिनिषेधौ विशेषणमुपसङ्क्रामतः सति विशेषबाधे' इति न्यायः । जातेष्टिन्याय and others. How न्याय formed the very backbone of the qnia system can be judged by the nomenclature of several taiat works, particularly that of Jaimini, which is called the न्यायमाला.

The difference between the two schools:- 

It has become difficult to distinguish between the two schools in view of the peculiar relation in which they stood soon after their inception. They started with distinct spheres for their speculations. The नैयायिक school had to deal with logic, the वैशेषिक with metaphysics. One can imagine how the first नैयायिक and वैशेषिक must have dealt with topics purely logical and metaphysical respectively. But the works of the first नैयायिक and वैशेषिक are lost to us and we find in कणाद's वैशेषिकसूत्र and गौतम 's न्यायसूत्र respectively metaphysics with a sprinkling of logic and logic with bits of metaphysics: because, sufficient time must have elapsed since the inception of the systems which were now on their way to amalgamation. Thus when कणाद establishes अनुमान as a प्रमाण ( 2. 1. 8. ) or when he refers to tamas (3.1.15.) he deals with topics that come within the pale of 14. And when 

, on the other hand, deals with topics like the permanence of the soul (3. 1. 19) or when he determines that our bodies are constituted of only one element he deals with topics that fall within the sphere of metaphysics. In short, the systems that were to investigate in different spheres were already showing a tendency towards amalgamation. 

And the reasons for this tendency are not far 

(VIII)Introduction. 

to seek. Both the systems had appeared to temper the reaction from the tendency to place a blind faith in the authority of the scriptures. Asadas they do show deference for the Vedic tradition. But a tendency to differ from the tradition where it clashed with reason is also slightly perceptible in both the systems. When the says that the 

ðíâ¤ body is made up of one element only, he differs, en- grounds of reasoning, from the that says that the body is made up of three elements or five. When a नैयायिक defines मोक्ष as दुःखाभाव and not as ब्रह्मात्मत्वप्रतीति, he shows a tendency to differ from the 

Thus both were rationalistic and here we can 

trace the common meeting-ground of both. The anecdotes that कणाद's last words were पलिवः पीलवः in- stead of the name of some god and that there was a clash between the वैदिक व्यास and the नैयायिक अक्षपाद * (a), though not credible, are yct significant of the attitude of the two systems towards the gut. 

The system in from that in those of a

gories that are supposed to exhaust the Universe.

is dialectical and deals with sixteen heads that 

have a bearing on dialectics and reasoning. 

2. कणाद admits two प्रमाणs प्रत्यक्ष and अनुमान, गौतम admits 

two more, उपमान and शब्द. 

After TM and 

the systems came nearer 

and nearer. The writers who came in the field brought about a syncretism between the two schools and to-day the distinction between them is no more than theoretical. 

Now, one is said to belong to the or the वैशेषिक according as he adheres or not to the theories summarised in the following stanza cited in the सर्वदर्शनसङ्ग्रह :- 

द्विले व पाकजोत्पत्ती विभागे च विभागजे । 

यस्य न स्खलिता बुद्धिस्त वै वैशेषिकं विदुः ॥ 

1. The वैशेषिकs hold that द्वित्व is produced ( जन्य ) by अपेक्षायुद्धि; the नैयायिकs hold that it is only made known ( ज्ञाप्य ) by अपेक्षायुद्ध अन्नम्भट्ट holds the fromer view, 1 ( see notes on सङ्ख्या. ) 

2. The नैयायिकs hold that when a jar is baked, the change of colour is due to the atoms in the jar (पीलु) being baked individually. The s hold that the jar as a whole (fa) is baked and not the individual atoms. The former are called पीलुपाकवादिन्s and the latter पिठरपाकवा दिन्s. अनम्भट्ट holds the former view 2

Introduction. 

3. The वैशेषिकs hold that विभाग can be कर्मज as well as विभागज while the नैयायिकs hold that it can be कर्मज only. अन्नम्भट्ट admits विभागजविभाग like the वैशेषिकs. 1 

We can extend the list by adding the following:- 

4. समवाय is अनुमानविषय according to the वैशेषिकs. It is प्रत्यक्षविषय according to the नैयायिकs. अन्नम्भट holds that it is inferrible only.? 

5. जीवात्मन् is inferrible only according to the वैशेषिकs. It is perceived directly by the mind acco- rding to the नैयायिकs अन्नम्भट्ट holds the former view. 

Thus अन्नम्भट्ट shows a tendency towards the वैशेषिक system. 

[[4]]

Are कणाद's and गौतम 's systems atheistic ? 

The 14 and the systems have been included by tradition in the list of वैदिकदर्शनs ( दर्शन = philosophy) also styled ananas as distinct from the अवैदिकदर्शनs like those of the जैनs and the बौद्धs. Tradition says, 3

2. It is not unhikely that this theory of the न्याय-वैशेषिक atheism 

was due to their bearing some resemblance to the Epicureans sc far as the atomic theory was concerned. It the Epicureans demed God, well, so might the न्याय-- वैशेषिकs: seems to be the 

idea. 

[[44]]

Cp. Webb's History of Philosophy 'Its attraction ( that of the atomic theory) to the Epicurean School, however, was not its scientific utility so much as its apparent inconsistency with the doctrine of the divine government of the world which they regarded as the source of the worst evil that affects mankind, namely the fear of death, and what may come after it." (p. 66) 

(XIII) 

Introduction. 

If we suppose that it is commentator's' ingeu- ity that is behind this assumption, no such suppo- sition is possible in the case of the last सूत्र, तद्वचनादा- म्नायस्य प्रामाण्यम् where सत् evidently stands for ईश्वर. Again, now and then, shows the highest respect for the which is one more evidence to show that he was not an atheist. His eulogy of धर्म which he specifically describes in the सूत्र अभिषेचनेापवास ब्रह्मचर्य गुरुकुल वासवानप्रस्थयज्ञदान etc. is one more instance in point. 

That's system was not atheistic at its inception is further proved by the tradition of the origin of the system, which howsoever mythical and fanciful, is yet typical of the spirit in which the system has been looked upon. 

Tradition3 says 

that in the form of an owl revealed the a to कणाद being pleased with the latter's austerity. This tradition dating as far back as प्रशस्तपाद + is illustrative

again, there is a 

which exp- 

had a place in his system. Cp.

In the presence of this 

how can we say, as some have said, that man is silent on the question of ईश्वर ? गौतन again evinces a deep regard for the Vedic tradition. Cp. his 

मन्त्रायुर्वेदप्रामाण्यवच्च तत्प्रामाण्यमप्राप्तप्रामाण्यात् । 2. 1. 67.

कणाद and गौतम 

The earliest extant work of the 

system is the वैशेषिकसूत्र of कणाद, also styled the वैशेषिकदर्शन. The system as it is developed in the s gives ground to the belief that the as must have been preceded by other works on the subject, which the सूत्रs like the सूत्रs of बादरायण and जैमिनि supplanted by their systematic form and comprehensive treat- ment; and the view of some1 that the 

thought must have existed prior to the rise of Buddhism seems to be well founded Thes of are held by some2 to be later than the as of a while others3 hold the opposite view which seems to be more reasonable than the former. 

The author of the सूत्रs is styled कणाद or कणभुक् or all meaning 'Atom-eater.' Some associate the 

name with the theory of atoms for which 

is 

held responsible. Others say that he got the name

It is no doubt very tempting to ascribe a Greek origin to ¿017's theoryof atoms. But suppose the atomic theory had really been borrowed from a Greek source, would it not be strange that's atoms are supposed never to assume visible dimensions till there is a combination 

of three double atoms( »¶¤ )? I do not remember anything like 

this in the Epicurean authors and it seems to me to give quite an independent character to s' view of the nature of an atom.”

differs from that of Democritus, who first developed the theory in Greece which was later adopted by the Epicureans, on the following points:- 

1. According to Democritus atoms differ in quantity or size, and not in quality. Accor- ding to the the qualities of an atom of the earth are different from those of an atom of water and light and air, which in their turn differ mutually. But their sizes are the same. 

2. Democritus and Epicurus hold the atoms to be in motion by nature, while the believes that they are at rest until moved 

into action by अदृष्ट or परमेश्वर. 

3. Greek atomism dispensed with the agency of God in creation: The

admit the agency of God in a more or less definite shape.

which cannot be due to Greek influence and it is easy to find anticipations of the atomic theory in the early Indian thought. 

Jain Atomism vs. 3⁄4à¤ Atomism:- 

The atoms of Jainism are so different in their nature from those of the a system that no theory can be tenable which regards one as the borrower of the other. In Jainism all atoms possess the qualities of रूप, रस, गन्ध, संयोग and a potential power to produce though they themselves are शब्दरहित. In the वैशेषिक system the atoms of the different substances possess different qualities and have got nothing to do with which is the exclusive quality of 

which is fay and has 

no atoms. This sets aside the claim that the 

is an off-shoot of Jainism.

A general estimate of the 14-¤ system:— 

When our horizon of knowledge is ever widening it is not unlikely that we may fail to look at the accomplishments of the system with any deep regard. Some of their theories like those of an and rata may not appeal to the scientific mind of our centuries. Our faces may be lit up with smile not unmixed with sarcasm when a f of the calibre explains away the f of a with the शङ्कर मिश्र remarks,

( उपस्कार on the वैशेषिक सूत्र II. 1. 5 ) 

We might question the logic behind the argument advanced to prove that gold is. To us the view of कणाद that the ऊर्ध्वञ्वलन of fire and the A of wind are the workings of the Unseen तिर्यक्पवन might sound a little superstitious. But these are negligible before the solid contributions the system has made to human thought. The of the 

परमाणुवाद वैशेषिकs, their theory of causation, the न्याय of गौतम, the treatment of logical fallacies and the classification into categories are all entitled to a high place in the history of thought. And even where the 10- 

fails we have to make allowance for the limitations, particularly, in the field of the exper- imental sciences, under which it had to labour in those early days. The argument to prove the a of gold like several others suffers from this drawback. 

"Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it," asks Bertrand Russel in opening his Probl- ems of Philosophy and none need be sorry if the न्यायवैद्यषिकs have indulged in certain vagaries of thought. It may be true as Radhakrishnan says that theirs is not a harmonious system like the

We must approach and appraise such schools of thought bearing in mind the remarks made by the same great philosopher (Russel) about the capacity of philosophy. 

"However slight may be the hope of disc- overing an answer it is part of the business of Philosophy to continue the consideration of such questions, to make us aware of their importance, to examine all the approaches to them, to keep alive that speculative interest in the universe which is apt to be killed by confining ourselves to definitely ascertainable knowledge ".

Tr.- Having placed the Lord of the Universe in heart and having saluted the spiritual preceptor a compendium of Categories is being composed for the easy understanding of youngsters. 

The author enters upon a discussion as regards the propriety of a ¤, in his, which is a running commentary on the . Therein he establishes that it has been an invariable practice with the 2 or those who admit the ultimate authority of the Vedas ( वेदप्रामाण्याभ्युपगन्तृs) to begin their works with a which ensures their completion without anything untoward coming in the way (निर्विघ्नपरिसमाप्त्यर्थ. )

The popularity of the treatise in its field is evinced by the number of commentaries thereon. The treat- ise is sufficiently simple and does not share the cumbrous style of other works. 

तर्कसङ्ग्रह 

} 

तर्क is here used as a synonym for q category ' ( सन्ते प्रतिपाद्यन्त इति तर्का : द्रव्यादिपदार्थाः ) So तर्कसङ्ग्रह means पदार्थसङ्ग्रह, a compendium ( सङ्ग्रह : सङ्क्षेपेण oui ) of the categorics. The word has been used in the same sense in the nomenclature of some other treatises on Sanskrit Logic, like ma, agal. The primary significance of the word તાજીમુયો. 

which means' Reasoning' must have been an incentive to its constant use in naming treatises on Sanskrit Logic, because Reasoning' forms the 

very back--bone of Logic.

But how are we to get the 1 of the infinite things in the Universe? With the limitations imposed upon humanity it is impossible for man to rightly comprehened things individually. Is it then impossible to get rid of fara? Are we destined to rot in the perpetual thraldom of ignorance? 

It is exactly in overcoming this difficulty that science is most helpful. By analysis and synthesis science makes the infinite finite. Cows may be infinite. But do I not correctly picture to myself essentially the cows that gum lifted in the past, from fauz's cowpens? Can I not project my imagination in future and visualise essentially the cows that are yet to appear in the world? So the individually infinite cows cease to be beyond the grasp 

of my finite knowledge. What has helped me is analysis and synthesis, or, in other words, classification. 

Any science worth the name forges or at least attempts to forge some instrument based on classi-

fication to overcome this infinitude of Universe. When आरुणि, in the छान्दोग्य, asks his son श्वेतकेतु, 

उत समादेशमप्राक्ष्यः येनाश्रुतं श्रुतं भवति अमतं मतं............... 

he precisely wants the latter to grasp a prin- ciple that would enable him to overcome infinity: the principle in the instance being reality of causes is based on a classification of causes and effects. 

The tendency to classify, on the part of the as, the infinite things in the world, resulted in the assumption of the sevens. Take anything in the world and it must needs be capable of being subsumed under some one of the seven rás. To put it otherwise, the seven qs exhaust between them the whole universe. Eventually, if the seven чs are known the whole universe is known and मिथ्याज्ञान is radically removed.. 

A very close parallel to the qs of the fas is to be found in the ten Categories of Aristotle a Greek thinker ( 384–322 B. C. ).

पद्यते गम्यते अनेनेति पदे-a word.

Some say that गौतम has enumerated sixteen पदार्थs. But to call the 16 topics of discussion enumerated by गोतम as पदार्थ is a misnomer. गौतम never implies that the 16 heads exhaust the things in the universe and as this is the basic conception of 4, the sixteen heads of

वक्रत्व, नृसिंह says, is also अवयवसंयोगविशेष. 

Of the twenty-four qualities some belong to the मूर्तद्रव्यs exclusively, some to अमूर्त or विभुद्रव्यs exclusively, while others belong to both.

Motion may be vertically either upwards ( उत्क्षेपण ) or downwards ( अपक्षेपण ), and horizontally towards oneself ( 3⁄45*7 ) or farther from oneself (яaka).

hing a cow from a horse, say, it becomes विशेष. According to the later तार्किक, सामान्य always remains a सामान्य, because it is an objective quality running through the members of a class, not changing with our view point. 

This view in based on an inaccurate interp- retation of the सूत्र, सामान्यं विशेष इति बुध्यपेक्षम् कणाद wants to make a distinction between two kinds of 8191748 and two kinds of विशेषs. 

There are three सामन्यs which can be विशेषs and vice versa vis. द्रव्यत्व; गुणत्व, कर्मत्व. [ इत्यत्वं गुणत्वं कर्मवञ्च सामान्यानि विशेषाश्च' ) 

There is one 91917 viz. 88 which can never be विशेष (भावोऽनुवृत्तेरेव हेतुत्वात् सामान्यमेव ) 

There are some विशेषs ( अन्य विशेषs ) residing in eternal things which can never be सामान्यs ( अन्यत्रान्त्येभ्योः विशेषेभ्यः ) 

. 

One might naturally ask how is it that some सामान्यs and विशेषs can be विशेषs and सामान्यs respectively, while others cannot. A reply to the question is given in the words बुध्यपेक्षम् It depends, says कणाद, upon their giving अनुवृत्तबुद्धि (cognition of persistence ) and व्यावृत्तबुद्धि. (cognition of exclusion ) द्रव्यत्व, for exa- mple, can give both the notions. cannot give व्यावृत्तबुद्धि because there is nothing that cannot come under सत्त'. The नित्यद्रव्यवृत्ति विशेष cannot give अनुवृतबुद्धि. By their very nature they are distinct. प्रशस्तपाद' does not at all distort the sense of the as Keith wants

सामान्य is divided into two divisions, पर सामान्य, the higher generality and अपरसामान्य, the lower generality. Others, like fuafite (emad), give three divisions पर, अपर and परापर. 

पर and अपरसामान्यः- If we consider the सामान्यs पृथिवीस ( व्यापक ), and घटत्व, (घट manufactured from पृथिवी ) पृथिवीत्व is परसामान्य being the more comprehensive of the two, घटत्व the अपरसामान्य, being less compreh- ensive ( व्याप्य ). But पृथिवत्वि becomes an अपर सामान्य with regard to which is a wider class. Thus according to this division, परत्व or अपरत्व is only relative, determined by the more or less compreh- ensive nature of one class in relation to the other. 

पर, अपर, परापर or व्यापक, व्याप्य, व्यापकव्याप्य सामान्यः- According to this division at is the 17 and is always so, no other more comprehensive class being found. अपरसामान्य belongs to that class, which is the least comprehensive and cannot have any other sub-class. Thus घटत्व is अपरसामान्य, and is always so because no class less comprehensive than it is found. All classes between these two extremes are , for they can be relatively and अपर. Thus पृथिवीत्व is पर with regard to घटत्व but अपर with regard to . Thus according to this division पर, अपर and परापर are absolutely so and not relatively. $ अनुवृत्तयुद्धिः सामान्यस्य (लक्षणं) व्यावृतबुद्धिर्विशेषस्य । निस्यद्रव्यवृत्तयोs- नन्ता विशेषाः । ते खल्वत्यन्तं व्यावृत्तिहेतुत्वाद्विशेषा एव । उपस्कार on वै. सू

for instance, do not consist of parts. The fas viz आकाश, काल, दिक् and आत्मा do not consist of parts. The minds being atomic also do not consist of parts. How, then, are we to distinguish between one atom and another or one and another, in other words, how are we to distinguish between 

नित्यद्रव्यs ? 

It is to solve this difficulty that the category of a has been invented by the ass. They say that eternal substances are distinguished one from the other by the fans abiding in them. Each eternal substance has one which is distinct 

from other विशेषs. 

It should be clearly seen that every atom of geal, xq, àt: aig, will have one 7 in it. Therefore, we can distinguish not only an atom of one substance from that of another, say, qi, but also between two atoms of the same substance. Again, each of the four substances आकाश, काल, दिकू, आत्मन् has cne fa distinguishing it from all others. 

Every mind again has one fan distinguishing it from all other minds as also from all other substances. 

We can thus distinguish between eternal things, no doubt. But what is it that distinguishes one far from another? If you admit a second faời as residing in the first to ride over the difficulty the fault of will arise. So the replies by saying that the s perform a double function. First, they distinguish the eternal objects in which they abide and, secondly, they distinguish them- selves mutually ( स्वतो व्यावर्तर्क ).

Knowledge of अभाव, say the तार्किकs, is depende- nt upon the knowledge of its counterentity (प्रतियोगिन् ) i. c. the thing of which is predicated. Thus to know घटाभाव we must know what a घट is. 

अभाव is प्रत्यक्षविषय according to the तार्किकs. Because, they say, we see with our इन्द्रियs, अभाव like घटाभाव, पदाभाव. According to the भाट्ट मीमांसक अभाव is the object of an independent प्रमाण called अनुपलब्धि.

In Sanskrit definition an attempt is made to set the finger on a particular attribute which is peculiar to the thing and is thus capable of marking it off from everything else. That is why it is called Sassaùtiglada that is, a peculiar circumstance केवलव्यतिरेकितुविशेष 1 not to be found anywhere else. If a ft wants to define a cow he will define it by saying that it is a Mega, animal i. e. one which has the dew-lap. He knows that it is only the bovine class that has this distinguishing feature. This is the implication of the definition of लक्षण as असाधारणो धर्मः. 

This is indeed a happy device to mark off the thing defined from all others. But a definition. ought to be more ambitious. Not only must it distinguish the thing defined from everything else, but it must, side by side, give us an insight into the nature of the thing. To that extent, Sanskrit definitions are deficient because they never attem- pt to give us a glimpse of the essence or nature of the thing.

According to the definition water will be earth, an apparent absurdity, and the stone will be not-earthy which is improbable. points out how such cases are not in conflict with the definition.

The atomic theory may be thus for. Every material object, if it is earthy (šta ), watery (a), luminous (a), or aerial (a ), is found to consist of parts. (,,, and

We could have gone on analysing the objects into their constituent parts till infinity, if this process of analysis ad infini- tum had not plunged us into a logical absurdity. If this analysis were not to stop at a particular terminus every object big or small would be found to have been composed of infinite parts. Thus the à¤* mountain will consist, according to this reasoning, of infinite parts and so a d (mustard seed) will be analysed into as many i. e. infinite parts. Thus the mountain and the mustard seed will be both equal in size because both consist of infinite component parts-an absurdity too patent.

daily usage, that a particular thing is greater or smaller than another, because the difference in size is determined by the greater or smaller number of the constituent parts. A mango is larger than the plum because the constituent parts of the former are more in number than those of the latter. But if the parts become infinite where then the difference between the sizes of the two? 

So what is required is a terminus where I must stop my analysis. In other words, I must assume a standard unit further than which I am not going to analyse and in terms of which I can say that this this thing is big and that small. And this standard part is "the atom" of the 10¥¤ which thus is supposed to be indivisible. The assumption of the unit of atom explains why one thing is bigger than another. That which consists. of more atoms is bigger, and that which consists of less is smaller. 

The theory is to be developed thus. A mater- ial object that is perceptible is found to consist of parts. Those of parts smaller still. If we were to analyse in this way the smallest perceptible part will be the त्रसरेणु or त्र्यणुक which is of the size of the mote in the sun-beam, smaller than which no object is seen. This g, because it is perce- ag, + ptible, must consist of parts, which are called. ags "diads" which are imperceptible and formed of two atoms each. These s, inasmuch as

they (parts) give to a product (g) possessing magnitude, they must be themselves constituted of other constituents. For potsherds are constituted of smaller constituents. What the means is 

this. If the 4 

were constituted of gs it ought to be अणुतर; because he supposes महत्त्व and अणुत्व to be opposite dimensions. Thus as two products conjoined result in producing a product which is महत्तर so two अणु products ought to result in an अणुतर product. But sag is perceptible and hence cannot be an aga thing which must be much more super- sensuous than an ag thing which is admitted to be supersensuous. So the parts of the must not be as but the as divisible into the smaller gs. 

Why do they admit त्र्यणुक to consist of three व्यणुकs (=63ys) ? 

The as being produced from ags are the- mselves in size. If two as had formed the त्र्यणुक it would have been अणुतर. But since the number is three, they can well give rise to the त्र्यणुक which is महत्. Because the rule of the वैशेषिक system is that महत्त्व' is produced by कारणमहस्व, कारण बहुत्व ( not द्वित्व ) or प्रपयविशेष. That is, the महत्व of a thing is produced either by the magnitude of the parts, or the plurality (not duality) of the parts if they do not possess magnitude, i. e. are g, or the peculiar way of arrangement as in a bale of cotton where greater or smaller pressure results in smaller or greater size of the bale. 

Then why not say that the 4 consists of three ags which would account for its magnitude? The answer to the question seems to lie in the possible idca in the mind of the a that it is more natural

to descend from 3 to 2 and then to 1 than to des- cend from 3 to 1 at once. Thus descent from the व्यणुक to suणुक and thence to the अणु seems more nat- ural than from the sयणु straightway to the अणु.

Even supposing this division is of ga in general to what else can it refer if not to अनित्य पृथिवी ? 

So whether we admit this reading or that, the upshot is the same. a gai makes explicit and 

clear what is implicit in पुनस्त्रिविधा. 

शरीरेन्द्रियविषयभेदात् : -- This division is plainly based upon the notion that the universe exists for us as an outcome of our merits and demerits. As a result of our merits and demerits, we must enjoy pleasure or suffer pain which is derived from our experience of external objects (44). Our souls cannot get this experience unless they are embod- ied (). Mere possession of the body will not enable us to experience the objects in the world, in the absence of senses ( इन्द्रिय ). 

It is with the help of the sense-organs ( 44 ) that the souls residing in the bodies (a) can experience objects in the world ( विषय ).

Tr.-Light is what possesses hot touch by inti- mate relation. It is of two kinds: (1) permanent and (2) impermanent. The permanent is of the form of aloms. The impermanent is of the form of products. Again, it is of three kinds, being divided into body, the sense-organ, and the object (of sense). The body is ( what belongs to souls) in the solar world. The sense is that with which colour is perceived, the sight situated on the top of the black pupil. The object is fourfold. (1) Earthy, (2) Celestial, ( 3 ) Gastric or belonging to stomach and (4) Mineral. The Earthy consists of fire and other kindred (fiery) objects.

आदित्यलोके, वरुणलोके etc. -- These are mere assumptions of the f to account for existence of bodies parallel to earthy ones. When you admit the body to be composed of one single element you must prove existence of bodies exclusively watery ( अप् ), lustrous, (तेजस ) and aerial (वाधु ). As we do not come accross such bodies on earth, we can well imagine their existence in the respective worlds of वरण, आदित्य and वाधु, says the ताकि. 

The Vedantist view about the formation of the body does not plunge them into this absurdity. They say that no body is made up of any one element excl- usively. It must be composed of all elements, (five or three) with one element in preponderance which gives its name to the product. Thus a so-called earthy body will consist of earth, air, water, light, and ether. If there are watery products like river etc they also must be constituted acc- ording to this principle. This assumption of qaciou or (1) does not force them to assume bodies in वरुणलोक etc.

Needless to say the argument is defective and typical of the way in which the s lightly brush aside objections that demanded a close scrutiny. If the absence of the peculiar qualities is explained away by having recourse to the make- -shift of the theory of suppression of qualities by another substance why should we not say that सुवर्ण is पृथिवी or any other substance, with some counteracting agent coming in the way of the manifestation of qualities? Again, the very pre- sumption that its fluidity cannot be destroyed has been radically shaken by modern physics which proves how any substance can be reduced to either of the three conditions, (1) solid (2) liquid or (3) gaseous. 

But we 

must make allowance for the yet undeveloped experimental sciences in those early days and admit that the value of the argument lies not so much in the soundness of the conclusion as in its boldness of attempt to tackle a knotty problem with as much precision as could be commanded then. The aftes could not think of that intense heat, as we can, now, which could reduce any substance to any of the three states.

Tr-Air is devoid of colour but possesses touch. It is of two kinds viz. ( 1 ) Permanent. and (2) Impermanent. The Permanent is in the form of atoms The Impermanent is in the form of products. Again it is threefold according to its division into the body, the sense--organ, 

and the object of sense. The body is (what pertains to souls) in the world of ag. The sense-organ is what enables us to apprehend touch, the sense of touch (त्व) extending over the entire body. The object is the wind that is the cause of the shaking of trees etc. Vital breath is air that permeates through the body. Thugh one, it receives names like प्राण, अपान and others owing to the various limiting adjuncts

Creation and destruction of the world:

When God wills to create, action is produced in the atoms of ( gât, eg, à¤; and a) two of which (atoms) combine to form a ; three व्यणुक a त्र्यणुक Four श्रयणुकs form a धतुरणु. And in this way the products are formed, small and big. 

But 

The Old and the New as agree in their views so far as the process of creation goes. they differ vitally in their views respecting process of destructiou.

Sect. 13] 

Notes- 

In the case of ■g they could not say that its destruction is preceded by the destruction of its constituent parts ( समवायिकारण), because the समवायिकारण of gas is as which are indestructible. Therefore they said that the destruction of as follows upon the destruction of their असमवायिकारण ( viz संयोग between the two ags.) 

The weak point in this view lies in its assum- ption that creation and destruction proceed in the same order. To revert to the instance of gry, चतुरणुक, ifs are destroyed first, where can the be in the interval between its destruction and that of the त्र्यणुकs ? If we take off the pillars can we suppose that the roof can stand even for a moment ?

To obviate this difficulty the neo-s held that the products are destroyed by the destruction of the असमवायिकारण viz. संयोग between the अवयवs, in While the old school admitted असमवायि- only in the case of g, the new school admitted it in all cases of destruction. Thus if a ggs is to be destroyed, it will be destroyed by the destruction of the conjunction between the *ges which remain intact. They thus admit that the creation and destruction proceed in the oppos- ite order. First ❤g will be destroyed and then *g* and so on. Needless to say, this view is more reasonable than the first.

आत्मन् is divided into two classes ( 1 ) जीवात्मन् and (2) परमात्मन् जीवात्मन्s are the souls of individual beings and are infinite in number. The God is one only. Both are fay, all pervading. Every has 4. The qualities of the soul are perceived by the mind only.

If I find, in some place, an axe and a log of wood, I shall be quite logical if I were to infer therefrom that there must be some wood cutter who makes use of the axe to lop off the wooden log. Similarly corresponding to the axe and the log we find the various senses (s) and their particular objects (e. g. the art and the of the g). So we shall be quite right in inferring some agent who makes use of these. This agent is the जीवात्मन्,

Many erroneous notions exist as regards the nature of the जीवात्मन्. The तर्कदीपिका refers to and repu- diates two. (1) Some hold the i to be identical with the body. This assumption will make the la as much liable to change as the body. Thus the of देवदत्त the youth will be different from that of the old man which is absurd. Again, a wcunded soldier's Soul will be less than what it was before he got wounded. And the soul will perish as soon as the body perishes. All these consequences revolt against the immutability and indestructibility of the soul. (cp.nfar, azdaìsanidisaq) अच्छेयोऽयमदायेोऽयम्) 

Some hold that the senses () are indivi- dual souls. Then the soul that secs will be differ- ent from the one that hears and so on. This will make a cognitiou, presupposing a single soul, of the type, 'I who saw, hear now, impossible, the two souls being different according to this theory.

१८ मनस्. 

Tr. Mind is the means to the cognition of plea- sure etc. Being assigned to every soul minds are infinite in number, atomic and permanent. 

Mind, according to the fs, performs a double function. First, it is accessory to the ams or external senses like : and, the perceptions of which are transmitted by the mind to the soul. ( cp. आत्मा मनसा सन्धुज्यते । मन इन्द्रियेण इन्द्रियमर्थेन ). Secondly it is the exclusive organ which perceives सुख, दुःख, इच्छा etc, and is, therefore, defined as सुखायुपलब्धिसाधनम्. In the first case, मनः acts as a helper to the महिरिन्द्रयs. In the second it acts as an independent with specific objects of its own. 

Mind is atomic ( परमाणुरूपं ) :- 

The 

sets out an argument to prove view that 

how is atomic as against the it is all--pervading. 

(59) 

-Noles 

[ Sect. 18 

If the mind were all-pervading (fay) it will never be in contact with the self which is also all--pervading. Because the rule is that two fay things cannot be conjoined. And absence of cont- act with the soul will result in an absence of cogn- itions ( ज्ञानानुत्पत्तिप्रसङ्गात् ). 

Even if we were to admit that two fay things are conjoined, their conjunction will be eternal, never ending, because no action producing disjun- ction is possible in the case of the as which are, as a rule, क्रियारहित. And if the supposed विभु mind were to be in conjunction with the विभु आत्मन्, there will be no end to their conjunction and consequently no end to cognitions. We shall then get cognitions even in deep sleep. Because the fay mind, even after it enters the gun vein as it is supposed to do in deep sleep, will have some part of it outside the g, and this part will be in conjunction with the 

outside the gua and thus even in deep sleep there will be cognitions necessarily resulting from आत्ममनःसंयोग. As this is against the very nature of gy in which cogniti ons are conspicuously absent ( सुखमहमस्वाप्सम् । न किश्चिद- वेदिषम् 1 ) मनसु cannot be admitted to be विभु. Tho 

says that the atomic mind severs its conjun- ction with the self when it enters the gun in which soul is conspicuous by its absence and thus deep sleep devoid of cognitions is induced.*

The develops the curiously subtle which may be elu- 

argument for accepting a cidated in the following way. 

If I am able to perceive an object with my eye, I do so because the object possesses a manifest colour, ( उद्भूतरूप), says the सार्किक. In other words, 

gustara is a necessary condition for the ocular perception of an object and the pervades the whole of the abode () and not a part only like a. Thus if I see a white lotus it is because the 

lotus possesses white colour which persists throughout the lotus; if I see the red cloth it is because it possesses the red colour throughout. Similarly when I see a rainbow or a spotted deer I do so because each of them possesses a colour that pervades throughout. What colour can it be? cannot say that it is or or any of the

There could have been another solution of the difficulty. I could have said that the rainbow consists of parts each possessing one colour (रूपवत्समवेत ) But this would have been a complex way of expla- ining a thing which can be more simply explained by admitting चित्ररूप. It is simpler to say that इन्द्रधनुः is perceptible because it possesses than to say that it is perceptible because it is रूपवत्समवेत. 2 

All colours are found in a objects.

(cp. the दीपिका on पृथ्वी section ) गन्ध is a quality peculiar to Earth alone. That is why Earth is defined as ad. If rose-water possesses smell, it is due to the pre- sence of earthy particles therein.

Of these, in water the cool touch is found; in light, the hot one. The temperate touch is found in Earth and Air.

द्वित्वादिकं तु सर्वत्रानित्यमेत्रः- Here अभ्रभट्ट follows a peculliar tenet of the s wherein they differ from the नैयायिकs. The वैशेषिकs hold that numbers from two onwards are all created (जन्य ) by अपक्षाबुद्धि and hence अनित्य. अपेक्षाबुद्धि, 1 so far as सङ्ख्या is concerned, is the apprehension of the unities of objects more than one अनेकैकत्वबुद्धि : = अनेकेषां एकत्वानां बुद्धिः-अयमेकः sqùa cælenîsi già:). When we see, say, three jars standing we cognise them as this is one', 'this is one', 'this is one', and these cognitions collectively called age result in our cognising the totality of the objects, that is, their fa. According to the à, numbers, from two upwards are produced in the objects (ततो घटद्वये द्वित्वमुत्पद्यते) by अपेक्षाबुद्धि. According to the नैयायिकs अपेक्षाबुद्धि only enables us to cognise (ज्ञा) the numbers from two upwards which are therefore

Note that according to the तार्किक, अणुन्व and महत्त्व are as much opposed to each other as Vice and Virtue or good and bad. In other words, they are not different degrees of the same dimension. That is why they suppose that two ag products will be ag as two vices will make a man more vicious. It is easy to see how two मद्दत् things will make the product महत्तर.

पृथ्वस्व e. g. देववतो यादत्तात् पृथक is to be distinguished from अन्योन्याभाव eg. देवदतो यज्ञदत्तो न. The former gives a positive idea, the latter negative. While the latter rests with a mere denial, the former asserts in addition that it is something. We can say, गुणो न, but we cannot say, इव्यं गुणात्पृथक, because, ग्रन्य and

When there is हस्तपुस्तकसंयोग, there is काय (body ) पुस्तकसंयोग which is thus संयोगज, कर्मज संयोग may be again either अन्यतरकर्मज - eg. वृक्षकपिसंयोग ( कर्म being only on the part of कपि ) or उभयकर्मज ( e. g. महसंयोग where action resides in both the wrestlers). is a that abides only in a part of the pigs ( Only a part of the tree comes in conjunction with a part of the body of the monkey) and hence is called

The नैयायिकs who admit कर्मजविभाग refuse to admit the second variety on the score that the a of the TM, to take up the instance, is the same as that of the body and hence what is called ET विभाग ultimately proves to be कर्मज only. The वैशेषिक rightly say that the 

of the part cannot be the * of the whole- the wheels in a watch may move but the watch does not move-and hence when there is कायपुस्तक विभाग it is due to विभाग only and not कर्मन् which abides only in a part of the body . When once you admit संयोगजसंयोग you must admit विभागजविभाग. 

विभाग may be again अन्यतरकमेज or उभयकर्मजे ( वृक्षकपि- वियोगः and त्रयोवियोगः are instances of the two.) 

Note that in the case of विभुद्रव्यs only अन्यतरकर्मज संयोग or विभाग is possible because विभु^ substances are incapable of कर्मन्.

Tr. Remoleness and Nearness are the special causes relating to being remote or near. They abide in the four substances beginning with earth and in the mind. They are of two kinds: those that are brought about by space and by time. The remoteness caused by space abides in one who stays at a distance. The nearness caused by space is found in one who stays near. The remoteness due to time is found in one who is senior (in age). The nearness due to time is found in one who is junior (in age).

Water alone possesses natural fluidity. In the case of products like , and 3⁄4ã products like gaf, the fluidity is artificial being produced by the application of heat (:). ́ ́If water in the form of snow and sleet is solid, it is due to an उपाधि [ हिमकरकयोरोपाधिकद्रव्यत्वनिरोधात्सूर्य किरण भूमिसंयोगादिनो- पाधिनिवृत्तिमात्रम् । न तु द्रवत्वलत्तिः • वाक्यवृत्ति. ]

Tr. Sound, the quality which is apprehended by the sense of hearing abides only in Ether. It is of two kinds: (1) inarticulate and (2) articulate. The inarticulate is such as is found in the case of drum 

etc 

The articulate takes forms like the Sanskrit 

Language. 

आकाशमात्रवृत्तिः- शब्द is a गुण peculiar to आकाश alone. Note the different threefold division given in the तर्कदीपिका. The words in the दीपिका, भेर्याकाशमारभ्य श्रोत्रपर्यन्तं द्वितीयादिशब्दाः शब्दजाः are important as throwing light on the idea regarding the transmission of sound. If one hears the sound of a trumpet blown at a distance it is due to the sound at the origin producing another sound and so forth till the last sound so produced reaches the ear. The 

being nothing but is incapable of motion. There are two views regarding the way in which sound is transmitted. Some hold that the series of sounds travels only in one direction like the waves of the ocean (aîsîal 7). Others hold that the series radiates in all directions like the filaments of a कदम्ब flower ( कदम्बगोलक or कदम्बमुकुलन्याय ) that shoot forth in every direction. Considering that the same sound is heard on all sides, the second theory appears more reasonable.

For all practical purposes dealings' is a good rendering; because we see that our everyday transactions are a result of cognitions.

संस्कारमात्र जन्यः – The word मात्र is inserted in the definition to exclude प्रत्यभिज्ञा ( सोऽय देवदत्तः ) in which one recognises the object before him to be the same that he had apprehended before. In and प्रत्यभिज्ञा, the भावना संस्कर does operate. But while in

३५ अनुभव, यथार्थ and अयथार्थ, 

Tr. It is of two kinds: (1) right and (2) wrong. Right experience is that in which an object is cognised as possessing those altributes (:) which it does possess; e. g. the cognition, this is silver', with regard to silver. This is also called ¤¤. Wrong experience is that in which an object is cognised as possessing those attributes which it does not possess. e. g. the cognition of silver in the mother-o'-pearl. 

तद्वति तत्यकारकः अनुभवः- प्रकार is what distinguishes cognition of one object from that of another. In the cognition of घर, घरव is the प्रकार which dis- tinguishes घटज्ञान from other ज्ञानs like पटज्ञान. So तद्वति त- प्रकारक means, to take the instance of घट, घटत्ववति (घटे ) qzantes: &ght; which, in plain words, means that in 4 we cognise an object as it really is. In qi, on the other hand, the object is cognised as being what it is not. When a blind man is scared by a garland mistaken for a snake, there is अयथार्थानुभव.

What is meant by करण or असाधारणकारण ? If we take the instance of the lopping of a log of wood with an axe, the axe is the असाधारणकारण, according to the definition. So long as the axe is not there, there cannot be any lopping. Consequently fanta consists in being indispensable in the production of the effect. Well might one ask, is not the log as indispensable as the axe or more so? No doubt the log is indispensable for the fett but it is not व्यापारवत् as the करण ought to be. It is the व्यापारवत् असाधारणकारण that is the करण. The axe possesses the व्यापार necessary for the lopping of the log of wood;

the log of wood does not possess the करण is the instrument and not the regard to which the instrument is to is not the wood-cutter ? He is, but only secondarily. The for the cutting of the wood abides primarily in the axe, and only secondarily in the wood-cutter. Take away the axe, and what can the wood-cutter do? The wood-cutter can be substituted by another person who shall have to take the help of the axe. In view of this explan- ation it will be clear how 's definition ought to be modified by adding the word व्यापारवत्.. 

Two views regarding :-The ancients and the moderns are divided on the question of the nature of . According to the ancients (who define करण as व्यापारवदसाधारणं कारणं) करण is the instrument possess - ing the व्यापार (व्यापारवत ). According to the moderns ( who define करण as फलायोगव्यव छिङ्कारण ) करण is the व्यापार itself immediately followed by the effect. It should be seen that the attitude of the moderns is consis- tent throughout regarding the nature of the The ancients, on the other hand, are inconsistent in defining करण as व्यापारवदसाधारणं कारणं, and saying in the same breath that लिङ्गज्ञान or व्याप्तिज्ञान which is a गुण and as such व्यापारराहत ( and not मनम् ) is करण अभभट्ट who follows the ancients in his definitions is

Now, there are so may things which are नियतपूर्ववर्ति but nct कारणs तन्तुरूप is नियतपूर्ववर्ति of पट. The कुलालजनक is नियतपूर्ववर्ति of the घट, but if these were accepted as Rs, many things near or remote connected with the by an invariable antecedence will have to be accepted ass which is not desirable. Hence the adds the limiting clause mazuilaza aid to the definition. The clause means "provided the causal capacity is not exhausted (m) in producing something else." So the complete definition of is 

अनन्यथासिद्धत्वे सति नियतपूर्ववर्तिकारणम्. 

The दीपिका gives three cases of अन्यथासिद्धि which though not exhaustive, are yet indicative of the general principle that everything that invariably precedes is not the cause. That the cases are by no means exhaustive is borne out by the fact that the raises the number to five. 

The 

gives the following cases:- 

येन सहैव यस्य यं प्रति पूर्ववृत्तित्वमवगम्यते तं प्रति तदन्यथासिद्धम् which excludes cases like from being regarded the cause of पट. (तन्तुना सहैव तन्तुरूपस्य परं प्रति पूर्ववृत्तित्यभव

And since he is the cause of कुलाल he is अन्यथासिद्ध so far as is concerned. 

3. अन्यत्र वकृप्तनियतपूर्ववर्तिन एवं कार्यसम्भवे तत्सह भूतमन्य - थासिद्धम् this excludes cases like रूपप्रागभाव being regarded the cause of गन्ध. [ अपाकजस्थले क्लप्त ( शक्त ) नियत - पूर्ववर्तिनः गन्धप्रागभावादेव गन्धकार्यसम्भवे पाकजस्थले गन्धप्रागभाव- सहभूतः रुपप्रागभावः अन्यथासिद्धः ] Just imagine a jar after it is baked when it comes to have गन्ध and रूप. Speaking only about, what is it due to? Before the jar was baked there was गन्धप्रागभाव as well as रूपप्रागभाव ie both गन्ध & रूप were absent. Was it गन्धप्राग- भाव or रूपप्रागभाव that was responsible for गन्ध ? The reply is, गन्धप्रागभाव alone is responsible, for else- where ( अपाकजस्थल ), we have found that गन्धप्रागभाव is by itself an adequate ( वलत ) cause to produce गन्ध. (Note that the s regard of a thing as 

one of its causes. ) 

Thus these cases of अन्यथा सिद्धि prove that ( 1 ) a thing in 14 relation with the cause (2) the ant- ecedent of the cause and (3) a thing coexisting with the cause are not to be regarded as causes.

40 THREE KINDS OF CAUSES 

Tr. Causes are of three kinds: 1. Intimate cause. 2. Non-intimate cause and 3. Instrumental cause. 

समवायिकारण 

Tr. Intimate cause is that in intimate connection with which the effect is produced. e. g. the threads are (the intimate cause) of the cloth and the cloth of its own colour. 

समवायिकारण also called उपादानकारण can be predicated of only three out of the seven पदार्थs. Only अनित्य द्रव्य, गुण and कर्मन् can have a समवायिकारण सामान्य, विशेष and समवाय, and अत्यन्ताभाव being नित्य can have no कारण at all. प्रागभाव has no beginning and hence no कारण. प्रध्वंसाभाव andअन्योन्याभाव are अनित्य but their cause can- not be 

because a being negative can- not enter into a relation with anything. There- fore, we can assert a समवायिकारण of द्रव्य, गुण and कर्मन् only. 

The समवायिकारण which thus can be predicated of द्रव्य, गुण and कर्मन् will be found to be इव्य only. 

कपाa is the समवायिकारण of घट, उत्पल is the समवायि-

fans because the respec- 

can 

When we thus understand that 

be asserted of द्रव्य, गुण and कर्मन् only, we can easily point out the समवायिकारण of any द्रव्य, गुण or कर्मन्. If I want to point out the समवायिकारण of a द्रव्य, I shall place my finger on the s or constituent parts of which it is made. If I want to point out the समवायिकारण of a गुण or a कर्मन्, I shall point to the abode viz. the in which they abide. Consequ- ently in all instances the समवायिकारण will be a द्रव्य. In cther words, समवायिकारण is the अवयव, in the pair अवयव - अवयविन् and गुणिन् and क्रियावान् in the pairs गुण- गुणिन् and क्रिया- क्रियावान् respectively. 

असमवायिकारण. 

Tr. Non-intimate cause is the cause which is connected with one and the same object by intimate connection, along with the effect or cause of the latter. e. g. The conjunction of threads is the non- intimate cause of the piece of cloth, and the colour of the threads is the non-intimate cause of the colour of the piece of cloth. 

असमवायिकारणः If it is easy to detect the समवायिकारण. of a कार्य, it is not so easy to detect the असमवायिकारण Really speaking, असमवायिकारण is a very misleading name given to a cause which is closely. knit to the समवायिकारण and which plus the समवायिकारण amount to the effect. erant is thus to be taken to mean समवायीतर, and not समवायिविरुद्ध as it is likely to be interpreted. कपाल is the समवायिकारण of घट. But 

(85) 

-Notes 

घट is not mere 

3s_but 

[ Sect. 40 

कपालs 

s but something more. plus their संयोग is घट. So कपालसंयोग is the असमवायिकारण of घट. Similarly तन्नुसंयोग is the असमवायिकारण of पट. 

To take the असमवायिकारण of a गुण, नीररूप has उत्पल for the समवायिकारण. But mere उत्पल ( द्रव्य ) consisting of petals does not account for the total 

It is 3 

() of 

the उत्पल. 

and the " that amounts to the नीलरूप as abiding in the उत्पल. Thus, दलरूप ( colour of petals) is the असमवाविकारण of the उत्पलरूप. Similarly तन्दुरूप is the असमवायिकारण of पटरूप. 

To take the असमवायिकारण of a क्रिया or कर्मन्, the भ्रमण of the wheel has the wheel as the समवायिकारण. But mere wheel does not account for the . The wheel must be moved by the hand of the mechanic before it moves In other words, यान्त्रिकद्दस्तचक्रसंयोग is the असमवायिकारण of the भ्रमण of the चक्र. 

From the above illustrations it must have become clear that we can speak of the A&R¶ of such an effect only, of which we can predicate a 

. In other words, there cannot be any असमवायिकारण of an effect, if there is no समवायिकारण. And similarly, when one speaks of the anafar of a thing we can be sure that the thing must also have an असमवायिकारण. 

As समवायिकारण is possible to be predicated of onlyद्रव्य, गुण and कर्मन्, we can speak of the असमवायिकारण of these is only. 

It should be seen that the असमवायिकारण of a द्रव्य is always the # of its was (constituent parts); that of a is always the 4 of the substratum of the कर्म ( कर्मधार ) with another object like the mechanic's hand; that of a y is another similar गुण (तन्तुरूप, असमवायिकारण of पटरूप ) or another dissimilar

Notes- 

गुग [ बहुत्वसङ्ख्या ( गुण ), the असमवायिकारण of परिमाण ( गुण) in घ्यणुक ] or क्रिया ( कपि क्रिया the असमवायिकारण of कपिवृक्षसंयोग ). 

The श्रसमवायिकारण, therefore, stands close to the समवायिकारण and is hence described as समवायिकारणप्रत्यासन. Thus a proximity will be found to be of two kinds कार्यैकार्थप्रत्यासत्ति and कारणैकार्थप्रत्यासत्ति, also called लघ्वी and मद्दती प्रत्यासत्ति respectively 

When the तर्कसङ्ग्रह defines असमवायिकारण as कार्येण सदैकस्मिन्नर्थे समवेतः वे सति कारणमसमवायिकारणम् it refers to कार्यैकार्थ- प्रत्यासत्ति तन्तुसंयोग is असमवायिकारण of this variety. Because it is ( तन्तूनां ) पदात्मककार्येण सह एकस्मिंस्तन्त्वात्मके कारणे समवेत i. e. संयोग being a गुण is समवेत with the तन्तुs with which is समवेत also the पट there effect because तन्तु is अवयव, and पट, अवयविन्. When again, the तर्कसङ्ग्रह defines असमवायिकारण as कारणेन सह एकस्मिन्नर्थे समवेतत्वे सति कारणं it refers to का- कार्थप्रत्यासत्ति सन्तुरूप is of this variety. Because, तन्तुरूप is कारणेन पटेन सह एक नस्तन्तौ समवेत i. c. it is connected by समवाय with the same ng with which is connected its cause पर by the same relation (i. c. समवाय ). हस्तचसंयोग is कार्यकार्थप्रत्यासन्न. Because the संयोग abides in ar by समवाय, in which the भ्रमण, its क र्य also abides by समवाय ( Dissolve कार्येण or कारणेन सह एकस्मिन्नर्थेन त्यासत्ति; ) 

Thus the असमवायिकारण of a द्रव्य or कर्म will always be कार्यैकार्थप्रत्यासन्न. That of गुण may be कारणैकार्थप्रत्यासन्न as in the above instance or कार्यैकार्थप्रत्यासन्न ( cp. पात्रजगन्ध has तेजः संयोग for its असमवायिकारण which is कायकार्थप्रत्यासन्न ). 

From what has been said above, one can find out the असमवायिकारण by setting his finger on the cause which plus the समवायिकारण are embodied in the effect.

निमित्तकारण 

Tr. Different from both of these is the instrumen- tal cause, as the shuttle or loom of the piece of cloth. 

Whatever cause cannot come under any or असमवायि is निमित्तकारण. Thus the agent, instrument and such other causes will come under the broad class of fat. Time, space, God's will, Destiny and antecedent negation are the साधारण निमित्तकारणs because they operate while each and everything in the world is produced. 

निमित्तकारण can be predicated of द्रव्य, गुण and कर्म and also of प्रध्वंसाभाव and अन्योन्याभाव. Thus when a घट is destroyed the घटप्रध्वंसाभाव has for its निमित्तकारण the several things operating to destroy the . Similarly when I say राम is not लक्ष्मण, the अन्योन्याभाव is produced by the उत्पत्ति of राम and लक्ष्मण which, therefore, is the निमित्तकारण of the अन्योन्याभाव.

Tr. Of them (=1819ge4qxd ) perception is the peculiar cause of Direct knowledge. Direct knowledge is knowledge produced by the contact of the senses and the objects. It is of two kinds: indeterminate and

Notes- 

determinate. Indeterminate knowledge is knowledge of a thing without apprehending its attributes; e. g. This is something.' Determinate knowledge is knowledge of a thing with an apprehension of its attributes e. g. This is a Brahmin, this (man) is black. 

Having given the four broad divisions of यथार्थानुभव or प्रमा viz. (प्रत्यक्ष, अनुमिति, उपमिति and शाब्द ), 

Яn describes them in order. 

In the case of प्रत्यक्ष, the करण and कार्य are both given the same name. Thus while the process which gives us direct knowledge is called я, the result viz. the direct knowledge is also called qe. In the case of the other varieties of knowledge viz. अनुमति, उपमिति and शाब्दज्ञान, the करण and कार्य are named differently : अनुमान is the करण, अनुमिति the कार्य; उपमान the करण, उपमिति, the कार्य; शब्द the करण, शाब्दज्ञान the कार्य 

MA, 

इन्द्रियार्थ सन्निकर्षजन्यं ज्ञानं प्रत्यक्षम् Note that अनुमिति, उपमिति and शाब्दज्ञान are also इन्द्रियार्थसन्निकर्षजन्य, Thus before I infer पर्वतो वह्निमान् there must be चक्षुर्धमसन्निकर्ष. Similarly, when I get the उपमिति गवयशब्दवाच्योऽयं, there must be aff; Again, when I get सन्ध्यामुपासीत, there must be श्रोत्रशब्दसन्निकर्ष. How then are we to differentiate a from all these? The reply is that while प्रत्यक्ष is इन्द्रियार्थसन्निकर्षजन्य exclusively, other varieties of knowledge are as much depen- dent on 

as on other mental processes. सविकल्पक and निर्विकल्पक Indeterminate knowledge is the stage that precedes determinate knowledge. When I get a cognition e. g. (ч aan) this cogni- tion must have been preceded by another when I cognised the only as something existing किमपि. In other words, in the stage of निर्विकल्पक I

As प्रत्यक्ष is इन्द्रियार्थसन्निकर्षजन्य, precisely speaking, निर्विकल्पक ज्ञान alone is प्रत्यक्ष, सविद्यल्पक being something more than . But, for all practical purposes, it is better to admit सविकल्पक as प्रत्यक्ष also, because on it are based all our experiences in life. It should be seen that the Buddhists admitted Affe alone to 

be real. 

This explains the definitions, निष्प्रकारकज्ञान and सप्रकारकज्ञान in the text. In किमपीदं, the ज्ञान is without any attributes ( प्रकार =श'न विशेषण ); in घटोsय, the ज्ञान is विशिष्ट by the प्रकार, घटत्व. The detailed definitions विशेषणविशेष्यसम्बन्धानवगाहिज्ञानं & विशेषणविशेष्यसम्बन्धावगाहिज्ञान in the दीपिका mean the same thing. In निर्विकल्पक, no reference is made (aq) to the connection of the thing ( विशेष्य ) ( इदं किमपि ) with its attribute (विशेषण) (घटत्व) though both are there, vis, सत्ताज्ञान and the घटत्वादि 

of past experience. In afa, there is reference ( भवगाहि) to this connection of विशेषण and विशेध्य.)

सन्निकर्ष 

Tr. The contact of the senses with their objects which is the cause of direct knowledge can be of six kinds, viz. (1) conjunction, (2) the intimate relation with the things conjoined, (3) the intimate relation with what is intimately related with the things conjoined, (4) intimate relation, (5) intimate relation with the intimately related, (6) and the relation of the attri- bute and the thing qualified. 

The author now proceeds to describe the varie- ties of contact of the senses with their objects which are six in number.

SIX KINDS OF सन्निकर्ष. 

(1) 

Cr. Conjunction is the contact when, with the eye, the direct perception of a jar is produced. 

Here the sight directly gets joined to the object, the theory being that the travels to its object and returns with an image thereof. 

The theory of perception: The gives the process of direct perception. All our experiences are the outcome of our and a. So, in order 

that the soul should suffer pain or enjoy plea- sure, to be derived from direct perception, it com- es in contact with the mind which in its turn is connected with the sense, the latter getting again in contact with the object. The resultant experi- ence whether pleasant or otherwise is the outcome of our ч or (merit or demerit ). 

धर्म अधर्म 

As अनुमति, उपभिति and शाब्दज्ञान are all based on more or less it follows that the pleasure or pain to be derived from them is equally the result of our past merit or demerit. 

(2.) 

Tr. Intimate relation with thing cɔnjoined is the contact in producing the direct perception of the colour of the jar which is in conjunction with the sight. 

घटरूप is समवेत in घट ( गुण – गुणिन् ) which is संयुक्त with the चक्षुरेन्द्रिय. 

(3) 

Tr. In the direct perception of the generality ‘colourness' (&) the contact is the intimate relat- ion with what is intimately related with the thing conjoined. 

(92)Sect. 43] 

Notes- 

( 

कात्व is समवेत with रूप ( जाति - व्यक्ति ), which, in its turn, is समवेत with घट ( गुण -- गुणिन् ) which is चक्षुः संयुक्त. 

Tr. 



(4) 

Intimate relation is the contact 

when we get a direct perception of sound with the sense of hearing. For, the sense of hearing is ether. 

Abiding in the cavity of the ear sound is the special quality of ether and there is intimate relati- on between the quality and its abøde. 

is 

The s hold that 

nothing but कर्णशष्कुल्य वच्छिन आकाश, ether limited by the cavity of the ear. So is the of 

the समवाय between श्रोत्रेन्द्रिय and शब्द. 

(5) 

as well. Hence 

Gr. In the direct perception of the generality of sound the contact is in intimate relation with the thing intimately related. Because the generality of sound is connected by intimate relation with sound which is in intimate relation with the sense of hearing. 

Note the rule of the us that the d of a thing is perceived by the same sense by which the thing itself is perceived. Thus being perc- eived by the eye, also will be perceived by the sight. being perceived by the ear, oce also will be perceived by the organ of hearing. 

Tr. The contact in the direct perception of negati- on is the relation of the attribute and substratum of attribute. For, in the cognition' there is no jar on the ground' the ground in contact with the sight is qualified by the attribute of the negation of the jar. 

The is hold that is perceived by an independent means of proof ( प्रमाण ) called अनुपलब्ध. 

( 93 ) 

-Noles 

[ Sect. 43 

(Cp. the 1). Against these the fits hold that negation is perceived by . They say that 

प्रत्यक्ष. is perceived by the same sense that perceives the counterentity. Thus is perceived by the same sense viz. चक्षुरिन्द्रिय that perceives the घट. The cognition of is as much a प्रत्यक्ष as the 

घटप्रत्यक्ष. 

In this प्रत्यक्ष of अभाव, the चक्षुरिन्द्रय is संयुक्त with the भूतल which is the विशेष्य of the विशेषण घटाभाव thereon. Thus this सन्निकर्ष amounts to विशेषण- विशेष्यभाव which differs from the विशेषण- विशेष्यभाव in instances like नीलमुत्पलम् where there is समवाय between नीलरूप and उत्पल while there is no such additional relation ( falten: सम्बन्धः ) between अभाव and its आश्रय (विशेषण - विशेष्यस्वरूपमेव ). 

Tr. Thus Direct Perception is knowledge produced by the contact of the senses with their re- spective objects The peculiar cause thereof is the organ of sense. Therefore it results that the sense is the means of direct perception. 

Note that इन्द्रिय is the करण and इन्द्रियार्थसन्निकर्ष, व्यापार of according to the old as whom z follows. According to the नव्याः, इन्द्रियार्थसनिकर्ष will be the करण of प्रत्यक्षज्ञान. It should be noted that घ्राणेन्द्रिय, रसनेन्द्रिय, and श्रोत्रेन्द्रिय can apprehend the respective गुणs, their सामान्यs and their अभावs. 

चक्षुरिन्द्रियः- can apprehend द्रव्यs in addition to its respective गुण i e रूप, सामान्य of the गुण and also its अभाव.

Tr. Inference is the cause of inferred know- ledge. Inferred knowledge is knowledge produced by scrutinisation (quasi) 

It should be noted that aga is the process that leads to aff. In the stock instance of inferred knowledge, the mountain is fiery because smoky, the conclusion that the mountain is fiery is the अनुमिति and the process consisting of पक्षधर्मता and व्याप्ति is the अनुमान. 

The student should see that agan differs from in giving us the knowledge of a thing that is not in direct contact with our senses. In the

senses do not 

as they do in 

instance of fire on the mountain our come in contact with the fire at all, direct perception. In the whole process of infer- ence, I see smoke on the mountain, and to that extent, my senses come in contact with an object. 

Inferred knowledge depends upon two things. First, I must see the smoke on the mountain. This is technically called . Secondly, it is necessary that from my past experience I must have gathered that whereever there is smoke there is fire. This is technically called . I bring my past experrence to bear upon the present case of the smoke on the mountain. This is technically called qua And this results in the final judgment that the mountain is fiery 

A. 

Tr. Scrutinisation consists in the knowledge that the case under consideration possesses the indicatory mark characterised by invariable conco- mitance. e. g. this mountain possesses smoke that is invariably associated with fire. 

The author now proceeds to define which gives us aff. As said above, inferred knowledge results from the co-ordination of two distinct congitions. The thing on the basis of the presence of which I am going to form the judgment must be present in the particular instance (g). The smoke must be present on the mountain on which I am going to infer the existence of fire. Again, I must have a knowledge of the invariable concomi- tance () between smoke and fire which I must have derived from my past experience. Both these result in what is known as परामर्श. 

Tr. And the cognition produced by the mountain is fiery is inferred knowledge. 

it that 

(99) 

-Notes 

[ Sect. 44 

The definition is simple in the light of the above explanation. 

Tr. Invariable concomitance consists in the certainty of association that wherever there is smoke there is fire. 

This association is either positive ( ) or negative (केवलव्यतिरेकि ) or both (अन्वयव्यतिरेकि) accor- ding as we can give a similar instance to support the argument on hand, or a dissimilar instance or both. To take the instance of the smoky mount- ain, we can state the invariable concomitance in either of the two ways. 

We can say wherever there is smoke there is fire, as in a kitchen ( यत्र यत्र धूमस्तत्र तत्र वहिः यथा महानसे ) or, negatively, wherever there is no fire there is no smoke, as in a lake. ( TA AG¶HITEAR AA YAIMIT: 44 ang. ) This sort of concomitance is called अन्वयव्यतिरेकि positive and negative concomitance because we can substantiate it with two kinds of instances similar (the kitchen) and dissimilar (the lake). 

But it is not possible always to give instances of both kinds. Sometimes we can adduce a similar instances only; sometimes there will be no similar instances but only dissimilar ones which are equa- lly effective in proving the case on hand. If we can adduce a similar instance only the concomit- ance is called 

(positive concomitance). To take an instance:-The jar is nameable because it is cognisable, ( «àstia: яù)—we can state the concomitance only positively. Because there is nothing in the world that is not nameable and hence a dissimilar instance we cannot come across. Thus we can say, 

(100) 

Sect. 44] 

Notes- 

Whatever is cognisable is nameable like a piece of cloth ( यत्र यत्र प्रमेयत्वं तत्र तत्र अभिधेयत्वं यथा पटे । ) 

But for want of a dissimilar instance we can- not, say, whatever is not nameable is not cognis- able, there being nothing that is not nameable. 

If we can adduce a dissimilar instance only, the concomitance can be negative only. Thus in the syllogism, 

Earth differs from other substances, because it possesses smell ( पृथ्वी इतरभेदवती । गन्धवत्त्वात् । यत्र यत्र इतर भेदाभावः न तद्न्धवत् यथा जलम् ॥ ) 

we cannot adduce a similar instance. Because any instance that could be called similar will be included in the class of earth and as such cannot be cited in support of the argument. To 

To be clear, if I were to say, whatever has smell differs from other substances like a flower, I shall be arguing in a circle. Because flower being earthy is included in the case under consideratton and as such cannot support it. 

In such cases we have to depend upon negative instances (aver) supporting negative concomitance. Thus in the inference under consideration, I have to give the concomitance only negatively, 

Whatever does not differ from substances other than earth does not possess smell like water [ यन्न इतरभेदवत् तन्न गन्धवदपि, यथा जलम् ]. This is 

negative concomitance. It should be seen that definitions because they touch upon the whole of the thing defined, can be supported by dissimilar instances and negative concomitance, and are hence described as केवलव्यतिरोर्क हेतु. 

་ 

The student must have thus seen that, accord- 

(101) 

-Notes 

[ Sect. 44 

ing to the possibilty or otherwise of adducing a similar of dissimilar instance, one can make use of positive or negative concomitance in the formation of a syllogism. This positive or negative conco- mitance determines the name of the indicatory mark also. Thus, in the instances given above, 

Smoke is an indicatory mark that is both pos- itive and negative ( 3⁄4-îìî) because with regard to it both kinds of concomitance can be given. 

In the second instance cognisability is an indicatory mark that is positive only, ( केवलान्वयि ) for with regard to it only positive concomitance can be given. 

In the third instance, smell is a negative indicatory mark, ( qawiał) because with regard to it only a negative concomitance can be given. 

Finally, the whole inference becomes positive or negative or positive-negative according as the indicatory mark is positive or negative or positive- negative.

is the particular thing about which we make the inference. In the stock instance of smoke and fire, the mountain is the on which the abides. Note that before anything can be a ч it must satisfy either of the two cond- itions:- 

Either I must be curious (iftgm:=doubtful ) to infer something about the mountain or though I myself am not so curious to know the thing

and 

The terms 

are important. the less extensive is the indicatory mark also var- iously called for ty or maa. The indicatory mark receives this name because its extension is less than that of the thing proved which therefore comes to be called the more extensive (1977). Smoke is found in a lesser number of instances than fire. In a red-hot iron ball there is fire but there is no smoke. Thus smoke comes to be called the r the less extensive and fire 

extensive.

Tr. Inference is of two kinds:—that effected for oneself, and secondly, that effected for others. 

The student should not suppose that the two varieties are quite independent. The first lies at the base of the second The first refers to the process of inference without any regard for formal statement. The second is merely the first put in a definite form., to convey the inference that I have informally made to another. When I infer fire on the mountain, I do informally go through the whole process which is formally laidout when I want to convince others of its truth. The inference for others (i) is nothing but the five-membered syllogism ( न्याय ) of गौतम. 

Cr. Inference for oneself is the cause of inferr- ed knowledge for oneself. Co wit, having realised by

repeated observation, in the case of the great kitchen and similar other places, the invariable concomitance that wherever there is smoke there is fire, when one goes to the mountain and doubts if there is fire thereon he happens to see smoke on it and remembers the invaria- ble concomitance that wherever there is smoke there is fire. Then arises a consciousness "This mountain possesses smoke that is invariably associated with fire." This itself is called the scrutinisation of the indicatory mark. From this, one gets the inferred knowledge, "the mountain is fiery. 

"This is what is known as inference for oneself. 

Note the four stages in an inference for oneself. (1) पक्षधर्मता (2) व्याप्तिस्मरण ( 3 ) परामर्श ( 4 ) अनुमिति. 

Tr. When, on the other hand, having himself inferred fire on the mountain one uses the six-memb- ered argument to convince another, that is an inference intended for others. c. g पर्वतो वह्निमान धूमात् । यो यो धूम- वान् स स वह्निमान् । यथा महानसः । तथा चायम् । तस्मात्तथा ॥

Notes- 

The student should master the above form as also the one given below to be able to put into logical form an argument based on positive or negative or positive-negative concomitance. It should be seen that the use of either of these varieties of concomitance depends upon the po- ssibility of adducing an instance in support of it.

Positive indicatory mark is one about which only a positive concomitance can be predicated. e. g. The jar is nameable because it is cognisable like a piece of cloth. In this instance there is no negative concomitance between cognisability and nameability Because everything is cognisable and nameable. The negative indicatory mark is one about which only a negative concomitance can be postulated. e. g. Earth differs from other (substances ), on account of possessing. smell. Whatever does not differ from other substances does not possess smell, like water. This is not so Therefore it is not like them (i.e. smell-less. ) In this case there is no positive instance to illustrate the positive concomitance that whatever possesses smell differs from other substances, because the entire Earth is the subject of the argument.

Thus I have seen smoke coming out of the kitchen and I know there is fire therein. This strengthens my conviction that there must be fire on the mountain also, because I see smoke thereon. 

In केवलव्यतिरेकि अनुमान, it is true, the requirement of aaa is not fulfilled. But still it is valid. Because there is no सपक्ष at all By its very nature केवलव्यतिरो के अनुमान leaves no scope for सपक्ष and still possesses the power to prove the particular thing. Thus in 

पृथिवी इतरभेदवती । गन्धवत्त्वात् । यदितरेभ्या न भिद्यते न 

तद्गन्धवत् । यथा जलं । नचेयं तथा । तस्मान्न तथा ।

This results in the ma called an which is defined as the one that is absent both from similar (a) and dissimilar (faq) iustances. Of course the defect consists only in its being absent from the similar instances (); its absence from the far is no defect; because every valid is required to be absent

This fallacy is not generally difficult to detect. It is exactly the fault known as arguing in a circle. If I say that the Aberdonians are stingy because they are Aberdonians I commit this fallacy. Som- etimes it may be a little more subtle, because the 

though exclusively abiding in the could be made out to be so with some difficulty. Thus in an 394 of the type 'war is inhuman because there one army butchers another,' the is the exclusive description of war and hence we commit the fallacy of असाधारण अनैकान्तिक हेतु, 

(3) Violation of विपक्षाद व्यावृत्ति 

[ साधारण अनैकान्तिक 

p. 30] 

To return to our instance of the fiery mountain, our inference that it is fiery because smoky is as much strengthened by our observation of smoke in similar instances () like kitchen as by our certain knowledge that it is absent from dissimilar instances (a) i. e. instances in which fire, to take our instance, is absent. Thus my conviction that the mountain is fiery is as much strengthened by my observing smoke in a kitchen with fire as by my failure to observe it in a lake without fire. Therefore, if any be found in the fa also, evidently my inference ceases to be valid. I begin to suspect that though the thing inferred may be true, its opposite may also be true, because I find the same present in a dissimilar instance, i. e. in an instance with the opposite or negation of the साध्य. This fallacy is styled साधारणानैकान्तिक because the हेतु is साधारण to सपक्ष and विपक्ष also. 

Thus to take the stock instance, पर्वता वह्निमान् ¶¶ (because it is cognisable), we know that 

(111)

[Sect. 52--57 

the 3, is present in instances where fire is present () as well as instances from which it is absent ( विपक्ष ). Thus a lake is as much प्रमय as a महानस प्रमेयत्व belongs to each and everything that can be the object of a cognition. Thus being present in the also, this is not conclusive. 

The student should study this fallacy very carefully because the majority of fallacious argum- ents suffer from it. It is not so obvious as the others and demands some wide knowledge for its apprehension. 

In our daily life, we indulge in fallacies that are mostly reducible to this because of our limited knowledge. Thus if I were to say to my learned. friend that some x. y. z. is a great social reformer because, like Ranade, he is a Judge of the Bom- bay High Court, I commit this fallacy. Because my learned friend knows that many a judge has sat on the judge's chair without caring a jot for the social uplift of his countrymen. So the viz. being a judge is defective because it is found in the fa also viz. those cases where a judge was 

not a social reformer. 

Again, if I were to say that x. y. z. is a great educationist, because, like Sir Ashutosh Mukerjee, he is a member of the University Senate, I again commit the same fallacy A man with knowledge of things educational knows too well how there are some who do not know the A. B. C. of education take their seats on the Senate; in other words, he knows that the is present in the fa 

also. 

Again, if I were to say that x. y z. cannot be intelligent because he belongs to the depressed classes, I commit the same fallacy. Because, now 

(112)Sect. 52-57 ]

it is known by all, how intelligence is not the special privilege of a few. One knows how brilliant people are not wanting in the depressed classes So being present in the विपक्ष also this हेतु is साधारण अनैकान्तिक.

5) Violation of असत्प्रतिपक्षत्व [सत्प्रतिपक्ष p. 31] 

Sometimes the सपक्षे सत्य and विपक्षाद्व्यावृतत्व may be unascertained in the case of a ty but there may be an opposite argument of stronger force which 

( 113 ) 

-Notes 

[ Sect. 52-57 

destroys the first argument. Such fallacies are called 

* 

to which there is a rival'. 

The stock instance is शब्दो नित्यः श्रावणत्वात् । शब्दत्वत् । (The 

is A and perceived by the same sense as the, individual). The rival argument is शब्दोऽनित्यः कृतकत्वात् । घटवत्। Here श्रावणत्व is a सत्प्रतिपक्ष हेतु, because the more appealing हेतु viz. कृतकत्व disproves नित्यत्व. We know how शब्द is कृत which necessarily proves af. We are not so conclusive as regards, which may or may not prove नित्यच. 

We have to interpret the fallacy only in this way. We have to take the second argument as the stronger of the two and more valid. Otherwise if we take both the arguments as inconclusive, there remains no difference between a¶g and अनैकान्तिक. Thus while in सत्प्रतिपक्ष we are conscious of a definite which proves the opposite of the साध्य and thus makes it invalid, in अनैकान्तिक the साध्य may be right but yet inconclusive. Thus पर्वतो व.मान् प्रमेयत्वात् may be right or wrong; it is incon - clusive. While in शब्दो नित्यः श्रावणत्वात्, the साध्य नित्यत्व is invalid1. This is what is meant by rat भावसाधकं हेत्वन्तरं यस्य वर्तते स सत्प्रतिपक्षः where there is a different to prove the negation of the first. 

• 

From this it will be clear that in, the second argument must be stronger than the first. The contention of some that in, both the arguments are of equal force is therefore untrue. After we admit that the second argument is stronger, naturally we have to admit that in afdrer,

Notes- 

the opposite argument must be based on only to distinguish it from where also a stronger conclusion disproves the first but it must be taken to be derived from means of proof other than अनुमान lest बाधित will be the same as सत्प्रतिपक्ष. 

How to distinguish the fallacy from विरोध ? While in the given proves the opposite of what it is supposed to prove ( कृतकत्व proves अनित्यत्व and not नित्यत्व as stated in the अनुमान ) in सत्प्रतिपक्ष, the does not prove the opposite necessarily. It is only inconclusive. In

, the 

To be able to detect the fallacy one must be able to know a more conclusive argument proving the opposite and thus setting at naught the argu. ment given. Thus, if I say, the earth is steady because we do not tumble as we walk on its surface, I commit this fallacy because the stronger inference that as a planet of a lesser magnitude than the Sun it ought to move disproves my first conclusion. Similarly, if I say, 'Education is bad because it taxes the brain,' I commit the same fallacy because everybody knows the argument that education is good because it imparts culture.

[ अत्र अनुष्णत्वं साध्य तदभाव उष्णत्वं स्पार्शनप्रत्यक्षेण गृह्यतइति बाधितत्वम् ] 

Really speaking सत्प्रतिपक्ष and बाधित are similar in nature and instances of one may be as well instances of the other. The only difference is in the way in which the fallacious as are repudiated. If we take the help of a stronger a, the fallaci- 

अनुमान, ous हेतु is सत्प्रतिपक्ष; if of a stronger प्रमाण other than अनुमान it is बाधित. Thus instances adduced to illust - rate hold good in the case of af, only with the difference that in the latter the stronger Я should not be a but some other.

It could prove the reasonably if we were to limit its scope just a little by stating that a must be igang (joined with or fed by wet fuel). In other words, we say that the अनुमान, पर्वतो धूमवान् । आर्दन्नसंयोगे वह्निमत्त्वात् is as valid as any other. And the अनुनान, पर्वतो धूनवान् वाहनत्त्वात् is fallacious only in so far as the is a little wider than it ought to be, on account of the 39 (31ZFUR- सयोग ). [ हिमत्त्व is definitely wider than आद्वैन्बनसंयोगे qura because the former is unconditioned, the latter conditioned. 

In the instance of साधारणानैकान्तिक, पर्वतो वह्निमान् प्रमेवलत् we feel that the हेतु is too wide and no reasonable condition (39) limiting its scope could make it a valid as in the above fallacy. 

ganz we are conscious that an euf (or) condition) will set the aright while in araraan such consciousness is not present. 

In short, in 

It must be confessed that the distinction between the two figures is subtle and may be said to be subjective also. What I feel to be an instance of साधारणानैकान्तिक may be taken for one of व्याप्यत्वासिद्ध by another with equal justice and cogency. That is why some logicians have taken both the fallacies to be identical. But as it stands, if I can set my

finger on an I shall be justified in taking the to be otherwise called सोपाधिक. If no such उपाधि could be caught hold of, the could be reasonably styled साधारण नैकान्तिक. 

This could be shown by taking one of the instances adduced to illustrate साधारणानैकान्तिक, To revert to the instance of Sir Ashutosh, if I say that the 'being member of the Senate,' if it were to be valid, ought to be conditioned by 'provided there is a wide experience of the methods of study and tuition' the हेतु becomes व्याप्यत्वासिद्ध One must admit that any member on the Senate who has a wide experience of the methods of study and tuition is an eductionist like Sir Ashutosh. It is a valid argument; and the argument in question is invalid. because unconditioned as it ought to be. 

Thus to judge whether a हेतु is व्याप्यत्वासिद्ध or साधारण नैकान्तिक one must see whether there is an उपाधि to limit its scope or not. 

What is an 

:-From the above discussion 

the nature of an 3 must have become clear. It is an adventitious circumstance, a condition which ought to be present before a certain which is too 

wide could be valid. 

उपाधि is defined by the तर्कसङ्ग्रह as: साध्याव्यापकत्वे सति साधनाव्यापकः उपाधि : i e उपाधि is that which being wider than the साध्य is not wider than the साधन. आद्रेन्धनसंयोग is व्यापक of the साध्य viz. धूम ( in पर्वतो धूमवान् वह्निमत्त्वात् ) i. e. we find आर्द्रेन्धनसंयोग wherever there is घूम. But it is not the व्यापक of the साधन वहि in the instance because we cannot say wherever there is a there is an anâqîn because वह्नि exists in many cases where आर्द्रेन्धनसंयोग 

(118) 

Sect. 52-57] 

Notes- 

a is invariably asso- 

is not present. In short, an ciated with the साध्य, but not so with the साधन. In other words, it is a condition which if tacked to the will make it conclusive and capable of rightly proving the thing in question. Thus आर्द्रेन्धनसंयोगे वह्निमत्त्व is a valid हेतु to prove धूमवत्त्व. 

साध्यव्यापक is explained as साध्यसमानाधिकरणात्यन्ताभावा- प्रतियोगित्वं. That is साध्यव्यापक which cannot be the counterentity of the absolute negation coexisting with the साध्य. [ साध्येन समानाधिकरणः यः अत्यन्ताभावः तस्य प्रतियोगित्वम् ]. Thus आर्द्रेन्धनसंयोग is not the प्रतियोगिन् ( viz. घट, पट the ) of the अभाव, (घटाभाव, पटाभाव etc. ) coexisting with the साध्य, धूमवत्त्व. With धूम exist अभावs of everything that is not धूम eg. पटाभाव, घटाभाव the counterentities of which are पट, घट etc This is an euphuistic way of saying that aâ¶¶_is invariably associated with धूमवत्त्व. 

साधनाव्यापकत्व is explained as साधनवन्निष्ठात्यन्ताभावप्रति- योगित्वम् [ साधनवत्=साध्यसमानाधिकरण . ] 

i. e. साधनाव्यापक is what is counterentity of the absolute negation coexisting with the ar. Thus just as घट, पट etc. are the प्रतियोमिनूs of the absolute negations coexisting with वह्नि the साधन, आर्द्रेन्धनसंयोग is also the fan of the a which coexists with a In other words, may exist in the absence of आर्द्रेन्धनसंयोग. 

घट, पट etc. are साधन व निष्ठात्यन्ताभावप्रतियोगिन् but they are not साध्यसमानाधिकरणात्यन्ताभावाप्रतियोगिन् while आर्द्रेन्धनसंयोग is so. Hence आद्रेन्धनसंयोग is the उपाधि in the instance under consideration.

It should be seen that an instance of one fallacy can, sometimes, be that of another too. It dep- ends upon one's knowledge to detect the fallacy. Thus an inference of the type: the earth is steady because we are steady may be an instance of a or सत्प्रतिपक्ष according as we advance a stronger अनु- भानेतरप्रमाण or अनुमान. 

This holds good in the case of other fallacies also. The student is required only to justify his view-point of fallacy. Two students may detect different fallacies in the same argument and be yet both of them right.

The process that leads to an 3 has been well described in a different reading. Its purport is: A person who is ignorant of the object denoted by the word (a wild ox) is told by a forester animal that bears close resembl- ance to a bull. As later the man happens to go to a forest he comes across an animal that bears a close resemblance to an ox but is not identical with it. At once he remembers the words of the forester and comes to the conclusion that the animal before him must be the (the wild ox.) 

Thus is only the realisation of the conn- ection of a name with the object denoted by it ( सञ्ज्ञा - सञ्ज्ञिसम्बन्ध ) It depends upon similarity between two objects and is hence called . The words of the forester, who is very much acquainted with matters relating to forest, in the instance, only perform the function of apprising the ignorant person of the similarity between the bull and the 

गवय. 

These are the constituents of this process:- (1) Ignorance of the sense of a word; ( 2 ) Know- ledge that the object resembles a particular thing, derived from a reliable authority; (3) Direct perception of an object that bears such a res- emblance; ( 4 ) The remembrance of the words of that authority; and (5) The knowledge that the particular object is called by that name.

Tr. Word is the sentence of an authoritative person. An authoritative person is one who speaks facts. Sentence consists of a group of words. e. g. 'Bring the cow. A word is what possesses power to convey sense. Power is a convention () set up by the desire of God that from a particular word a parlicutar sense is to be undrstood.

Tr. Expectancy, oompatibility and juxtaposi- tion are the cause of the apprehension of the meaning a sentence. Expectancy consists in the failure of a word to convey a coherent sense in the absence of anot- her word. Compatibility consists in the sense being not irreconcileable. Juxtaposition consists in the utterance of the words in close succession. 

What is meant is this. (1) In a sentence the words must be mutually dependent. The absence of one word from the sentence must leave it inco- mplete. (a) (2) The sense yielded by the constituent words of the sentence must agree with facts in our experience. () (3) The words, when they are uttered, must give us a connected notion, and must be hence uttered without any great interval passing between the utterance of one word and another (f.) 

Tr. A sentence formed without expectancy etc. must be unauthoritative, e. g. words like, ‘a cow, a horse, a man, an elephant', are not authoritative, for want of expectancy; a sentence like 'One should sprinkle with fire' is not authoritative for want of compati- bility. Of the words "Bring the cow each uttered

The author here gives illustration of the necessity of the three requisites of a valid sentence. 

Tr. Sentence is of two kinds: Vedic and worldly. Every Vedic sentence is authoritative because it is spoken by God. As regards the worldly sentence that which is spoken by persons of authority is authoritative. The rest (of worldly sentences) are unauthoritative. 

Vedic sentences:--The Vedas, the Brahmanas and the Upanishads come under this class. Worldy sentences:-The Smriti literature (including the Sutras) written by the sages as also the words of other authoritative persons come under this class. Note that the smritis command authority because they are based on the Vedas. If there is a conflict between the two, Veda will be held more author- itative. 

ईश्वरोक्तः - Note that the तार्किकs regard the Veda as spoken by God and thus having a begin- ning, impermanent; the मीमांसकs regard it as permanent, without a beginning or an end. sound is impermanent, according to the

Tr. Doubt consists in an apprehension that refers to the attribution to oneand the same substance of many conflicting attributes. e. g. “Is this a pillar or a man”? 

When one in darkness doubts whether a particular object is a pillar or a person, he attri- butes to the same substance the conflictig attri- butes of being a pillar and a man. Such knowledge is erroneous for in it one does not get definitely correct knowledge.

Tr. Perversion is false knowledge. e.g. the appreh- ension 'This is silver' in the case of a mother-o'-pearl. 

In doubt there is reference to two extremities and hence it is indefinite. In perversion the person is definite but wrong. 

The instance of doubt will cease to be so as soon as the man mistakes the pillar for the person or vice versa. So long as he vascillates between two extremes he is in doubt; as soon as he definitely takes a thing for what it is not he perverts.

Notes- 

तर्क. 

Gr. Method of reductio ad absurdum consists in making the opponent accept the more extensive when he accepts the less extensive. 

What is meant is this. If my opponent does not admit, say, that the mountain is fiery even when he sees and admits that it is smoky, I shall convince him by arguing negatively. If there is no fire on the mountain, I shall say, there will be no smoke also. But as both of us see the smoke, we must admit that there is fire on the mountain. Thus this method is useful in convincing the oppo- nent of the invariable concomitance between two things which he is not prepared to admit. 

In this method I force the opponent to accept the more extensive viz. absence of smoke if he accepts the less extensive, viz. the absence of fire. the more extensive is the ; the less extensive is the ; Smoke is present in many more instances than fire e. g. there is fire in the red-hot iron-ball but there is no smoke there.) This method is subsumed under erroneous knowledge because therein we suppose, to take the instance, that there is no smoke and fire when both are there. At any rate, here the error is conscious and purposeful and as such differs from the ordinary error. a includes a under doubt.

We find that the pleasure of one is the pain of another, our daily experience. If the difinition in the tex were accepted, such pleasures will be left out of it: scope. To include them the definition has beer modified in the so as to make pleasure a subjective feeling. As modified the definition सुख means whatever results in the cognition "I am happy.

Tr. Impression is three fold:-(1) Velocity, (2) Mental impression and (3) Elasticity. Velocity abides in the four substances beginning with earth (i. e. water, light and air ) and in the mind. 

Ether, time, space and self are all-pervading and hence do not possess velocity. 

Tr. Mental impression produced by exper- ience is the cause of remembrance and abides only in the self

Gr. Elasticity is the impression that restores to ils original form an object whose form was changed. It exists in earthy substances like a mat.

प्रागभाव AND प्रध्वंसाभाव 

Tr. Antecedent nonexistence is without a begin- ning but has an end. It exists prior to the production of the effect. Consequent nonexistence has a beginning but no end. It exists after the effect comes into existence. 

Note that both प्रागभाव and प्रध्वंसाभाव presuppose the production of the effect and are thus related to the problem of causation. There is of before it comes into existence. As soon as it comes into existence the disappears. That is why it is said to to be without a beginning and with an end. The end of the antecedent nonexistence is brought about by the appearance of the effect. 

Consequent non-existence is produced as soon as the is destroyed, and lasts for all time. to come. Thus it has a beginning but no end. The घटध्वंस is therefore the निमित्तकारण of the production of प्रध्वंसाभाव. 

Tr. Absolute non-existence is one which lasts through the three times and which has a counterentity characterised by contact. e. g. there is no jar on the ground.

-Notes 

[Sect. 80 

There are two views regarding absolute non- existence. According to the as it refers to things that do not exist at all, like the colour of the wind. The absence of jar on the ground is not absolute according to this view, because it is disturbed by the appearance of the jar on the ground while the absence of a hare's horn or colour of the wind is never disturbed. So, instances of nonexistence of the type af are relegated by them to a different class of nonexistence called temporary. (सामयिकाभाव) The नैयायिकs, on the other hand, say that both these cases come under the same class of absolute non-existence, and they do not admit a separate variety to account for cases like the absence of the jar on the ground. They argue that even if the jar be brought in it only temporarily obscures the absence of the jar which is there for all time. The view of the ass is more reasonable because they do not admit instances like the absence of the jar from the ground to be of absolute nonexistence as they are not (see ¤1). The case of the nonexistence of the hare's horn is quite different from that of the absence of the jar from the ground. here leaves the res school with which he has identfied himself and includes सामयिकाभाव under अत्यन्ताभाष. It should be seen that the argument of some that it is not possible to predicate the nonexistence of a thing which does not exist does not find support at the hands of the नैयायिकs and the वैशाषकs.

differentiates absolute non-existence from reciprocal non-existence. In the former, the counterentity is characterised by

Notes- 

contact (*), in the latter, it is characterised by relation of identity() In other words, in the former we deny contact, in the latter we deny identity. In saying there is no hare's horn on earth we deny contact between the two; in saying is not we deny identity between the two. 

Gr. Reciprocal non-existence is one that has its counterentity characterised by the relation af identity; e. g. the jar is not the piece of cloth.
