### Benediction 



Tarkasangraha is the most popular and the basic text of the Nyaya-vaiseṣika school dealing with logic and epistemology. The popularity of the text rests on the fact that it presents all the salient concepts of the school in a cogent and lucid fashion. But hidden within its outer simplicity is an inner depth that has been unravelled by a host of commentaries written during the last four centuries. The study of this text will not only help in the understanding of the Nyaya-Vaiseṣika school but will also lay a strong foundation for the comprehension of the principles of all other schools of Indian Philosophy. Once one captures the methods of cognitive analysis as presented in this system, one can handle any knowledge discipline with ease. Hence the famous statement of the Indian tradition: kāṇāda pāṇinīya ca sarvaśāstropakārakam— logic and grammar are foundational for all systems of knowledge. 



Though some English translations of this text are certainly available, there has been a long felt need to bring out a student-friendly book that caters to the needs of the present day students. The diagrammatic presentations of concepts and lucid explanatory notes on difficult aspects of the text will amply facilitate in understanding the concepts of Indian logic and epistemology with ease. I have no hesitation in asserting that this work of Prof. V. N. Jha is pre-eminently suited to all students of any discipline to begin their quest of Indian logic and epistemology.

It is indeed his sheer commitment to the Indian knowledge tradition that is responsible for this labour of love. As a student of Prof. V. N. Jha, I feel honoured to write this benedictory note for this unique work of his. 



I 



I pray to the Lord and Pūjya Gurudev Swami Chinmayanandaji that this translation and commentary of Tarkasangraha reaches a large number of students and may all be benefited by its study.

viiiPreface 



I feel immense pleasure in placing in the hands of our readers Prof. V. N. Jha's lucid English translation of Tarkasangraha of Annambhatta with elaborate notes. Although this is a basic text of Nyaya-Vaiseṣika system of Indian philosophy, it serves as a fundamental treatise to enter into the frame-works of other systems of Indian philosophy too with great ease. That is why; this text is compulsorily taught to all students of all disciplines of knowledge in our traditional educational system. Our world of experience carries names and forms. Here is an attempt in this text to capture the entire world of names and forms through language and that is why, this has become a fundamental text to enter into any intellectual discipline. It is a manual for the beginners. It deals with ontology, logic and epistemology. Although very brief in form, it is presented with profound clarity. 



Annambhaṭṭa composed Tarkasangraha and also a commentary on it called Dipika in the later half of the 17th Century. He was a Tailanga Brahmin of North Arcot (Chittoor) district of Andhra Pradesh who had settled down in Benaras. He is also the author of Nyaya- parisista-prakāśa. 



Although there are several English translations of Tarkasangraha still one will find that this translation of Prof. V. N. Jha is unique in the sense that it is lucid and simple and is augmented by elaborate explanatory notes with diagrams wherever necessary. His graphic 



ix 



presentation of the abstract ideas will immensely help the readers concretize the concepts. An index of Key Terms of Nyaya with their English equivalents and a list of commentaries on Tarkasangraha composed by various traditional scholars are also appended in this volume. Similarly, a detailed Bibliography of various editions of Tarkasangraha along with its 93 commentaries and sub-commentaries have also been appended at the end of the text which will prove to be of great use to the advanced researchers.

### Acknowledgment 



I taught this text of Tarkasangraha in the Chinmaya International Foundation (CIF) in June, 2009. Swami Advayananda, the honourable Acharya of Sankara-nilaya, got my lectures video-recorded and made them available in 22 DVDs for the use of the learners of Indian logic and epistemology. He also requested me to prepare one English Translation of this text with elaborate notes for the learners. The present volume is an outcome of his advice. 



Swami Advayanandaji's love for knowledge is indeed admirable. He is compassionate and therefore, is always engaged in preservation and dissimination of ancient Indian wisdom to the generations to come. I express my heartfelt gratitude to him. But for his constant reminder, this volume would not have seen its completion. 



Dr. Dilip Kumar Rana, the Director of the Chinmaya International Foundation Shodha Sansthan (CIFSS) came forward to bring out this book on priority basis. He also prepared a detailed Bibliography of various editions of Tarkasangraha which has been appended at the end of this volume. It has enhanced usefulness of this volume. I profusely thank him for this. 



Dr. Sheeba Sudheer, the Deputy Director of CIFSS, has done the entire DTP work upto corrections of the final press copy with the help of her colleagues Smt. Sarala and Smt. Ambika. I want to put on record the excellent job done by this team devotedly. Dr. Sheeba may not like my thanking her and so I say: May God bless her! 



xi 



Smt. Sarala and Smt. Ambika deserve special words of appreciation for adding value to this volume by appending a list of "Key Terms" along with their English equivalents of the Nyaya-Vaiseṣika system of Indian philosophy and a list of commentaries on Tarkasangraha composed by various traditional scholars. I wish both of them happiness and peace. I also take this opportunity to thank Professor Muraleemadhavan, the dynamic Chairman of the Shodha Sansthan, for encouraging the publication of sastric texts. 



I must mention here that the kind tolerance of my frequent absence from home by my wife, Prof. Ujjwala Jha (the Director of the Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, University of Pune) and my daughter, Miss Vedashree Jha (a student of Engineering Science), has contributed immensely towards the completion of this work. May God grant them all that they want! 



I have tried my best to make this English translation and Notes as lucid as possible using contemporary idiom and illustrative diagrammes. If it serves the purpose for which it is written I shall consider my efforts amply rewarded. Readers' suggestions will definitely be considered and incorporated in the next edition of this volume.

### Introduction 



There are six orthodox systems namely, Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaiseṣika, Pūrvamīmāmsā and Uttaramīmāmsā. Pūrvamīmāṁsā is referred to as simply Mīmāmsā and Uttaramīmāṁsā is popularly known as Vedānta. These six systems are called orthodox because they believe in the authoritative-ness of the Vedas. 



As against these, there are three philosophical systems which do not believe in the authoritativeness of the Vedas. They are Carvāka, Buddhist and Jaina systems. These are referred to as heterodox systems of Indian Philosophy. 



The orthodox systems are also called āstika-darśana and heterodox systems are known as nāstika-darśana. Here the terms āstika and nāstika mean that system of thought which believes in the authoritativeness of the Vedas and that system of thought which does not believe in the authoritativeness of the Vedas respectively. 



The terms āstika and nāstika do not mean here ‘one who believes in God' and 'one who does not believe in God' respectively, because the system of Mīmāmsā is an āstika-darśana and yet it does not believe in God. Similarly, there is nirīśvara-sānkhya and seśvara- sānkhya (yoga), Vaiśesika too did not have God in its sūtra-period. 



All the six Vedic-philosophical systems were initially formulated in the sutra-style. Kapilamuni composed Sankhya-sutras; Patanjali wrote Yoga-sutras; Kanāda wrote Vaiseṣika-sūtras; Gautama wrote Nyāya-sūtras, Jaimini composed Mīmāmsa-sutras and Bādarāyaṇa 



xiiicomposed Vedanta-sūtras. The thoughts of these systems developed through a very rich tradition of writing commentaries and sub- commentaries thereon which have recorded the intense dialogues between the heterodox systems on one hand and interorthodox systems on the other. These dialogues have added depth to Indian Philosophical systems. 



Iśvarakṛṣṇa wrote Sankhyakārikā; Vyasa composed Bhasya on the Yogasūtras; Prasastapāda wrote Bhāṣya on the Vaiseṣikasutras; Vātsyāyana composed Bhāṣya on the Nyāyasūtras; Śabara wrote Bhāṣya on the Jaimini- sūtras; and the Badarāyaṇasutras were commented upon by various schools of Vedanta. Śankarācārya wrote Bhāṣya on the Vedantasūtras; likewise Nimbārka, Rāmānuja, Mādhva, and Vallabha composed elaborate commentaries from a specific point of view giving rise to various schools of Vedānta. 



Therefore, Vedanta too is of various types: Advaita of Śankara, Śivādvaita of Kashmira, Śuddhādvaita of Vallabha, Bhedabheda of Nimbārka, Visiṣṭādvaita of Rāmānuja, Dvaita of Madhva and Acintyabhedābheda of Caitanyamahaprabhu. Although popularly one understands by the term Advaita as Sankara's Advaita, the philosophy of Bhartṛhari is called Śabdadvaita, that of Vallabhācārya as Śuddhādvaita and that of Kashmir Śaivism as Śivādvaita since their fundamental presuppositions are different. It is interesting to note that all these advaita-philosophers quote the same Vedic 



xiv 



text in support of their respective stand-points and this became possible only because their basic presuppositions were different. 



Like-wise two different interpretations of the Śābara- bhāṣya gave rise to two schools of Pūrvamīmāṁsā: 



(1) Kumārila and (2) Prābhākara. Murāri created a third school of Pūrvamīmāmsā by commenting directly on the Mīmāmsāsutras of Jaimini. 



Indian philosophical systems acquired structural depth because they honored freedom in thinking and respected others' positions at intellectual levels. That is why we find that whenever a particular system takes up an issue for discussion it presents first of all what others have to say on that issue. Even Cārvāka's view is not ignored. It is a different matter whether others' views are to be accepted or rejected, but this could not be done without critical examination. 



The Vaiśesika and the Nyaya systems were distinct in the beginning. God did not find a place in the Vaiseṣika School and abhāva as an entity was not discussed in the Nyaya School. But gradually there was give and take between these systems and by the 10th Century A.D. we find that these two systems have merged into one system due to their similar world-views. Thereafter these systems have been referred to by a combined name Nyaya-Vaiśeṣika. 



It appears that there has been intense debate between the Naiyāyikas and the Buddhist logicians and 



XV 



philosophers for at least one thousand years, if not more, over a number of philosophical issues. Whether there is something called substance or not, where qualities are located; whether there is a whole independent of its parts or not, whether there is self or not, whether absence should be given a status of an entity or not, whether there is necessity of accepting philosophical God or not many such issues engaged the attention of these philosophers. This dialogical literature of one thousand years is called Prācīna-nyaya. It consists of the Nyayasutras of Gautama, Nyāya-sūtra-bhāṣya of Vātsyāyana, Nyāyasūtra-bhāṣya-vārttika of Udyotakara, Nyayasutrabhāṣyavārttikatātparyaṭīkā of Vacaspatimiśra 



and Nyayasutrabhāṣyavārttikatātparyaṭīkāparisuddhi of Udayanācārya (10th Century A.D.). 



This bulk of literature is an outcome of an issue- oriented dialogue and hence Prācīna-Nyāya may be characterized as prameya-pradhāna. 



The 10th Century A.D. seems to be the turning point in the development of Nyaya-Vaiśeṣika thought. There is a shift of emphasis from prameya to pramāņa (epistemology). This turning point gave birth to what is known as Navya Nyaya. From this period onwards we find that the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers are engaged in preparing a precise language of discourse. They discovered that during the Pracīna-Nyāya period many a time the communication remained ambiguous because the language of discourse was ordinary Sanskrit language and hence they 



xvi 



decided to develop Navya Nyaya language which can be used for ambiguity-free communication in any field. 



Once this language was developed by the 13th Century A.D., all thinkers and philosophers adopted this very Navya Nyaya language to analyze a thought and wrote books in their respective fields of discourse. This language became so popular that not only the Nyaya-Vaiseṣika Philosophers but even the thinkers of Mīmāmsā, Vedānta, Vyakaraṇa, Alankaraśāstra and Dharma-sastra wrote books in this language and even today the same language is adopted as a tool to analyze ordinary language and represent human thoughts by many traditional scholars. 



The magnum opus of this period is the Tattvacinta- mani of Gangeśopādhyāya of Mithila of the 12th or 13th Century A.D. In the year 1976, the Nyayasiddhantadīpa of Śaśadhara has come to light. This is argued to be prior to Gangeśa by Bimal Krishna Matilal who critically edited the text and it was published from the L.D. Institute of Indology, Ahmedabad. 



When Tattvacintamani reached Navadvīpa (today's Nadia District of West Bengal), it occupied a central place in the intellectual academic program of that place. Raghunatha Siromani wrote an epoch-making commentary called the Didhiti on it. Two great logicians of Bengal wrote two independent and critical commentaries on Dīdhiti which gave birth to practically two independent schools of Navya-Nyaya. They are Jagadīśa Tarkālaṁkāra and Gadadhara Bhaṭṭācārya of Navadvīpa, the place where 



xvii 



Caitanya Mahaprabhu started his Bhakti movement. The two schools of Navya Nyaya are popularly known as the Jagadīśa-school and the Gadadhara-school and the two commentaries on the Didhiti of Raghunatha are known as Jagadīśī and Gādādharī. 



As I have already mentioned, the worldview of the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika system of philosophy and logic accepted the saptapadarthī model of capturing the entire world of human experience through natural language. 



This was necessary because the Buddhist idealists as well as the Sankaradvaitins held the view that reality could not be captured by language. The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers challenged this position and wanted to demonstrate that nothing can be known unless the world is presented before us with a name and a form. This system did not accept degrees of reality as proposed by Sankarācārya namely, vyāvahārika, prātibhāsika and pāramārthika levels of reality. If x exists, it is real and ultimately real. An atom (paramāņu) is as much real as God and a sky-flower is as much fictitious as rabbits horn (śaśa-śṛnga). 



Language presents the world with a form and a name and there is no logic to prove that whatever is presented through language is false because that claim will also have to be made only through language. 



The Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa (1623 A.D.) is a very small but very profound treatise to introduce this world-view of the Nyaya-Vaiseṣika system of philosophy 



xviiiwith utter clarity. It is a unique hand-book of Indian Logic and Epistemology. The method through which the entire universe has been analyzed through natural language is comparable to any analytic method of sciences and social sciences today. Training in this methodology empowers a serious enquirer to go deeper into any analysis of human mind. It is this reason that this text occupied a unique position in the traditional curriculum of any discipline of knowledge. 



The traditional structure of presenting a scientific system consists of three things: (i) uddeśa (listing of items to be discussed), (ii) lakṣaṇa (defining each item of the list) and (iii) parīkṣā (critically examining whether the definitions apply properly to the items defined or not) 



The Nyayadarśana of Gautama is composed in this format. Annambhatta seems to have followed this format excepting the third component namely, parīkṣā. 



The entire text of Tarkasangraha follows the uddeśa- lakṣaṇa-model. This text presents clearly ontology, logic and epistemology of the system of Nyaya-Vaiseṣika. 



Tarkasangraha can serve as the best text to develop the skill of Navya-Nyāya language too. At times we do find Annambhaṭṭa himself employing the Navya-Nyāya technique of defining a concept. 



In the present day context, it has the capacity to serve as a basic introductory book to understand and analyze any thought of any academic discipline. The following sketch will show how the entire universe is captured and 



xix 



analyzed through language and how beautifully the topics are arranged for discussion: 



bhāva (positive) 



Universe (= padartha-referent-entity) 



abhāva (negative) 



karman sāmānya viseṣa 



dravya guna 



samavāya (substance) (quality) (action) (universal) (particular) (inherence) 



prāg-abhāva (Pre-absence) 



samsargābhāva (relational absence) 



anyonyābhāva (mutual absence) 



dhvamsa-abhāva (destruction) 



atyanta-abhava (absolute absence) 



This is our entire universe and it has been captured in linguistic categorical terms. One thing one should note here. The whole universe has been categorized in two sets, one set of positive entities (bhāva-padārtha) and another set of negative entities or absence (abhāva-padartha). This implies that in this world there are bhāva-referents as well as abhāva-referents. Thus, there is a particular rose-flower, for instance, in the garden and there is absence of that rose-flower too in this world. The absence is as much real as the rose. Both the bhāva-padārthas as well as the abhāva-padarthas are equally real and hence existent and vastu (entity). Abhāva is not tuccha or a-vastu or fictitious. 



XX 



As a matter of fact since there are bhava-padarthas which are real, there are abhāva-padarthas which have to be real. There cannot be absence of a fictitious entity. If some one talks about it, it does not make any sense in terms of reality. 



substances 



earth water fire air ether time space soul mind 



We are on the ground now. We deal with these nine substances. Of these nine the first seven are external and the last two are internal. Each individual is a soul delimited by body. Each soul is provided with a mind. Through this mind the individual soul gets connected with the internal as well as external world. 



A substance is conceived as a locus where quality or action is produced. The list of 24 qualities is as follows: 



rūpa (colour) rasa (taste) 



gurutva (gravity) 



sneha (moisture) 



gandha (smell) 



śabda (sound) 



sparśa (touch) 



sankhyā (number) 



parimāņa (extension) 



pṛthaktva (separateness) samyoga (conjunction) vibhāga (disjunction) paratva (remoteness) aparatva (nearness) dravatva (liquidity) 



buddhi (cognition) 



sukha (happiness) duḥkha (unhappiness) iccha (desire) dveṣa (aversion) prayatna (volition) dharma (merit) adharma (demerit) 



saṁskāra (impression) 



xxi 



In this way, the remaining sub-sets have been presented and discussed. The classification of the entities has been so exhaustive that nothing is left out. In this very order each item is defined and discussed. 



#### English Translation: 



While translating this text into English I have tried to avoid the method of word-by-word translation, rather I have given more attention to making the issue, under discussion, clear. Communicational rather than philological approach has been respected. Modern idiom is preferred over traditional. 



### Explanatory Notes: 



As an aid to this goal, after translation of each text explanatory notes have been added and wherever necessary and wherever possible, diagrams have been added into to make the abstract ideas, a bit concrete. 



How to Read a Diagram? 



A box represents a cognition or knowledge. For example, ghața should be read as 'cognition or knowledge of ghața (pot). It shows that ghata appears as a content (viṣaya) of the cognition or knowledge. Relationships are shown by lines with some modifications. 



Straight line A (-) B indicates relation in general. An arrow (→) at the end of a line indicates the direction of relationship. 



xxii 



Thus A B means 'A' is related to 'B' and A← B means 'B' is related to A. 



A vertical 



line represents the relationship of 'locus-and-located' (ādhāra-ādheya-bhāva). Thus, 



dhūma 



parvata 



says that dhūma 'smoke' is located on parvata ‘mountain'. A hazy line' means there is a doubt about the relationship. Thus, 



vahni 



parvata 



means 'there is a doubt about the contact of fire on the 



mountain. 



A pair of parallel lines with an arrow at the end represents a delimiting relationship. Thus, 



ghatatva 



pratiyogita 



says that pratiyogita is delimited by ghatatva. 



xxiiiA pair of parallel lines with arrows on both the ends represents the 'describer-and-described relationship' (nirūpya-nirūpaka-bhāva). Thus, 



pratiyogitā 



anuyogitä 



should be read as pratiyogitā-nirūpita-anuyogitā or anuyogita-nirūpita-pratiyogitā. 



A cause-and-effect relationship is represented by an arrow in which the tip of the arrow is connected with the effect and the beginning part is connected with cause. Thus, 



dandaghata means danda 'stick' produces ghata 



'pot'. 



A blank box indicates it is a cognition without any content (visaya). Thus, 



means, it is a container or cognition which can have some content. It is nirākāra.

निधाय हृदि विश्वेशं विधाय गुरुवन्दनम्। बालानां सुखबोधाय क्रियते तर्कसङ्ग्रहः ॥ 



nidhaya hṛdi viśveśam vidhāya guruvandanam, bālānāṁ sukhabodhāya kriyate tarkasangrahaḥ. 



Translation: 1 



Having placed the lord of the universe in the heart (i.e. having remembered God) (and) having performed the prayer of the teacher (i.e. having prayed respectfully the teacher) the text called Tarkasangraha (lit. the text which summarizes the logical system of Nyaya and Vaiśeṣika) is being composed (by me) for easy understanding of the learners. 



Notes: 1 



There are six systems of Indian philosophy under the group called astika-darśana (the philosophical system which accepts the authority of the Vedic lore) and there are three systems of Indian philosophy under the group called nastikadarśana (the philosophical system which does not accept the authority of the Vedic texts). The six astikadarśana-s are Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaiseṣika, Pūrvamīmāṁsā and Uttaramīmāṁsā and the three nāstika darśana-s are Cārvāka, Bauddha and Jaina. 

  

[[1]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



The Nyaya and Vaiśeṣika systems were distinct in the beginning. Gautama or Akṣapada wrote Nyaya-sutra to present the logic and philosophical doctrine of the Nyaya system and Kaṇāda wrote Vaiseṣika-sūtra to present the world-view of the Vaiseṣika system. But both the systems started developing similar world-views and as a consequence, by the 9th/10th Century A.D., both merged together to form a single system of logic, epistemology and philosophy of life called Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika system of Indian Philosophy. The Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa is a systematic summary of that Nyaya-Vaiseṣika system of Indian Philosophy. 



The Nyaya-Vaiśeṣika system accepted God who created the universe of our experience. Hence, as an astika he remembers God and his teacher under whom he studied this system of thought. He performs, as it were, an act of expressing gratitude to seek their blessings for successfully composing and completing the text. He does this in order to set an example for his disciples who will also express gratitude to the Creator and the Preceptor before taking up the task of composing a text. The following of this practice of the tradition will make the next generation humble.

The significant contribution of the system of Nyāya- Vaiseṣika is the analysis of the entire world of our experience in terms of language. It is everybody's experience that the world with which we behave, whole of our life appears, before us with a form (rūpa) and a name (nāman). We think in language and understand in language. Thus, the whole world can be conceived as a set of what language refers to, that is, referents or padarthaḥ (padasya arthaḥ). In other words, the entire universe of our experience is nothing but a sum total of referents of elements of a language which we speak and understand. We capture the universe through language and communicate it through language. This world is knowable and nameable. It is real and ultimately real. It is not the case that language cannot capture Reality. On the contrary, if x cannot be captured by language then there is no method available to human beings by which they can know the existence or reality of x. In this sense, language maps reality and the entire universe can be categorized in terms of language. A sentence is a verbalised cognition of the world. Therefore, when we are analysing language, infact, we are analysing thought and through that we are

analysing the thought-content i.e. the world. This is what 



the Nyaya-Vaiśeṣika system did. 



It can be presented as follows:

This is our entire universe and it has been captured in linguistic categorical terms. One thing one should note here. The whole universe has been categorized in two sets, one set of positive entities (bhāva-padārtha) and another set of negative entities or absence (abhāva-padartha). This implies that in this world there are bhāva-referents as well as abhāva-referents. Thus, there is a particular rose-flower, for instance, in the garden and there is absence of that rose-flower too in this world. The absence of rose is as much real as the rose. Both the bhāva-padarthas as well as the abhāva-padarthas are equally real and hence existent and

vastu (entity). Abhāva is not tuccha or a-vastu or fictitious. As a matter of fact since there are bhāva-padārthas which are real, there are abhāva-padarthas which have to be real. There cannot be absence of a fictitious entity. If some one talks about it, it does not make any sense in terms of reality.

Colour, taste, smell, touch, number, size, separateness, contact, disjunction, remoteness, nearness, heaviness (weight), fluidity, moisture, sound, cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, volition (mental readiness or preparedness), merit, demerit, and impression are the twenty-four qualities (of the substances). 



Notes: 4 



These twenty-four qualities reside in the substance only. No quality resides in another quality or in any other entity naturally. Qualities reside in their loci naturally by inherence (samavāya). In this list the first fifteen belong to 



[[6]]



English Translation with Notes 



the external world and the remaining nine belong to the internal world. 



Thus cognitions, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, volition, merit, demerit and impression are the elements of our internal world. These occur in us (that is, in the soul which is a substance). These nine qualities are found only in the soul and hence they are treated as special qualities of the soul. For every individual these qualities occurring in his or her soul are exclusively internal and the rest of the world including these qualities in others' selves is external for him. 



Thus, each individual is interacting with two worlds: internal and external in getting access to both the worlds.

Notes: 5 



As a matter of fact all these five types of action can be covered by a single term namely, 'movement' Thus, these varieties are varieties of 'movement' only. A movement causes disjunction from one space and establishes conjunction with another space. 



[[7]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



Like a quality, an action also resides in a substance. No action will have another action or any other entity as its natural locus. That is, no action resides in any entity other than substance by the relation of inherence. 



luo Substance which has a limited size alone will have action. An omnipresent entity like soul, time, space, etc. cannot have movement.

Pervader and pervaded are the two types of universal or generic property or class-forming property. 



Notes: 6 



Universals are such properties which bring members to form one class. For instance, potness will bring individual pots to form a class of pots. A Universal, therefore, includes all members and excludes all those which are not the members of that class. Thus, it is a class-forming property. 



It is of two types, keeping in view its extension. 'Potness' includes all pots, but ‘earthness' includes all pots and also all those things which are made of earth. Thus, 'earthness' pervades 'potness' and 'potness' is pervaded by 'earthness'. Again, 'substanceness' will be pervader and 'earthness' will be pervaded by 'substanceness'. The

'pervader' occupies larger area in comparison to the 



'pervaded'.

However, the viseṣa-s (i.e. the ultimate distinguishing factors of permanent substances) occurring in all permanent substances are innumerable. 



Notes: 7 



It is to be remembered that the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika system of philosophy believes in plural world. In pluralism each entity is considered to be unique and distinct. Two entities of even the same class have to be different. How to account for this difference? Two pots are different. Why? Because the parts of one are different from the parts of the other. Again, why two parts of the same whole are different? We will have to say that parts of one part are different from the parts of the other part. In this way one can go on asking the same question, and we will get the similar answer. Can we ever stop asking such question and getting the same reply? The result is the contingency of the fault of anavastha. In order to come out of it one has to say that the two particles (paramāņu) out of which the immediate whole was created are partless. Still the enquiry continues and one would like to know: Why two particles are different 



9Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



from each other? It is here the Vaiseṣika system introduced the idea of viseṣa. They held the view that all particles, in other words, eternal substances must be provided with an ultimate distinguishing factor called viseṣa on the ground of which two particles could be distinguished. Once the two particles are made distinct, two pots can be explained as distinct, without any problem. In the same way all other eternal substances like ether, time, space, souls and minds could be kept distinction on the basis of viseṣa. This is how the reality of plurality is explained in this system. It is to be noted that it is because of accepting this unique entity called viśeṣa, the system is known as Vaiśeṣika system.

(The permanent relationship called) inherence is only one. 



Notes: 8 



Although the entities in the world are distinct, they occur in a cluster in a situation. Thus, language presents them as related. Language is preceded by a qualified cognition (viśiṣṭa-jñāna). In a qualified cognition three elements appear: qualifier (viseṣaṇa or prakāra), qualified (viśeṣya) and a relationship between the two. 



This relationship can be either a product (hence anitya) or permanent (nitya). The relationship which is a product 



[[10]]



English Translation with Notes 



is called samyoga or conjunction and it is included in the list of qualities. The permanent relationship is mentioned here as 'inherence'. 



In this relation the two relata cannot be shown as existing independently. In the case of conjunction, however, the relata can exist independently. That is why, the conjunction is accepted as caused or produced and therefore, many; whereas inherence is not caused, therefore, permanent and hence only 'one'. There are five cases where we need to accept inherence: 



(1) Between quality and a substance

Absence is of four types: pre-absence, destruction, absolute absence and mutual absence. 



[[12]]



English Translation with Notes 



Notes: 9 



We have already noted that an absence is as much real or existent as a positive entity is real and existent. 



Before a positive entity is produced there has to be a pre-absence of that entity in its parts and after that positive entity is produced in its parts that pre-absence is destroyed. This is the first variety of absence called 'pre-absence' 







Again, when the positive entity is destroyed there emerges an absence of that positive entity in its broken state. That absence is called 'destruction' and when we are referring to an absence which is existent in all the three times: present, past and future, that absence is called absolute absence. This absence is the third variety of absence, for example, 'there is no pot on the ground' Although it is difficult to grasp as an absence existing in all the three times 



- a little present, past and future closer analysis may not leave any scope for such difficulty. In this universe, every entity exists somewhere by some relationship. That is why we can say that by that relation that entity does not exist in some other place. A pot can exist in some other place. A pot can exist on a specific ground by the relation of 'contact' and when it does not exist by contact on another ground we refer to that absence as absolute absence. Here in fact, what we are negating is the relationship (i.e. contact) by which the pot rested. 



This absence not only exists today, it existed yesterday and will exist tomorrow too. It exists not only here, but 



[[13]]



absolute abse 



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



exists in the entire universe. This implies that such an absolute absence exists even on the ground where there is pot. Then, the question may arise, if the absence of pot exists also in the locus of pot, why can we not say 'there is no pot on the ground? The answer to this question is 'because the counter-positive of that absence i.e. the pot is present there' and knowledge of absence cannot arise if the counter-positive (pratiyogin i.e. virodhin i.e. abhāva-jñāna-virodhin) is present in the locus of its absence. Thus, the absolute absence is nitya and is present everywhere. 



The fourth variety of absence is the mutual absence. In the world each entity is distinct. It means that each entity is identical with itself and different from everything other than itself. In other words, each entity is related to itself by the relation of identity and to the rest of this world by the relationship of difference. Every entity possesses difference from the rest of the entities of the world. This difference is nothing but the mutual absence. Thus, while an absolute absence is denial of the relation of difference, the mutual absence is the denial of the relationship of identity.

Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



What is the idea of a definition after all? 



Definition is nothing but a property (dharma) by which we characterize the thing to be defined (lakṣya). That property should be an uncommon or peculiar property in the sense that it will include all members of that class of entities and will exclude all that do not belong to that class. How to achieve it? 



The neologicians (Navya-Naiyāyika) therefore, offered a definition of a definition: asadhāraṇa-dharmaḥ lakṣaṇam. asādhāraṇatvaṁ ca lakṣyatāvacchedakasamaniyatatvam. 



'An uncommon or peculiar property is called the defining property (lakṣana) of an entity to be defined (lakṣya). 



The uncommonality or peculiarity (asādhāraṇatva) of such property stands for 'the state of being pervade and at the same time being the pervader of the property which delimits the property of being the thing to be defined (lakṣyatā). 



samaniyatatvañca lakṣyatāvacchedaka-vyāpyatve sati lakṣyatavacchedaka-vyāpakatvam. 



'Being co-extensive means being pervaded by and being pervader of the delimitor (avacchedaka) of the property of being the thing to be defined (lakṣyatā).' 



Let us try to understand this with the help of an example. Suppose, we want to define 'cow' (go). The moment we decide to define a cow, the cow becomes 'the thing to be defined because a new property (agantuka- dharma) comes to reside in cow called lakṣyatā. This new 



[[16]]



English Translation with Notes 



property can come to reside anywhere in anything which we want to define. But we are not defining now 'anything' but 'cow'only. So how to say this or specify this? 



The Navya-Naiyayikas developed a language to specify this. They developed a concept called avacchedaka or delimitor. An avacchedaka is a specifier of the locus of the agantuka-dharma, the new property or the acquired property or the contextual property. When we are going to define 'cow', the new property called lakṣyata is produced in the cow: 



lakṣyatā 



go 



Now to say or specify that this lakṣyatā is in 'go' (cow) alone and not in any other entity at this moment we should delimit this new property namely, lakṣyatā by some property present in 'cow' which is lakṣya. 



But there are many properties in 'go? 'Go' is a padartha and hence it has padarthatva; it is a dravya and it has dravyatva; it is made of earth and so it has pṛthivītva and it is called a cow and so it has gotva. So how to select a property? Which of these four properties can serve as a delimitor of lakṣyatā in cow? 



If we select padarthatva, it will mean we are defining any padartha; but it is not true since we are defining 



[[17]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



only go. Thus, padarthatva cannot be the delimitor of the lakṣyatā of go. Then, can dravyatva serve the same purpose? Obviously not, because we are not defining any dravya but only 'go'. Similarly, pṛthivītva also cannot be delimitor of lakṣyata of 'go' because pṛthivītva exists in all entities made of pṛthivī and we are not defining any thing made of earth but only cow. 



od Gotva, however, can serve such purpose because it exists only in go and nowhere else. Therefore, gotva alone can specify the locus of lakṣyata. That is why, gotva will be selected as the delimitor of lakṣyata of 'go'. It can be put as follows: 



gotva 



go 



(lakṣya) 



lakṣyatā 



This means that we are talking of the definition of 'cow': 



An avacchedaka, therefore, has to be co-extensive (anyūna-anatirikta-vṛtti) with the avacchinna. It should occupy the same area which is occupied by the avacchinna, not less not more. 



Here, the āgantuka-dharma namely, lakṣyatā is avacchinna and gotva is avacchedaka. When we are defining 'cow', lakṣyatā is in all cows and only in cows and the cowness (gotva) exists in all cows and only in cows. 



[[18]]



English Translation with Notes 



Therefore, gotva alone which is a svābhāvika-dharma or natural property or inherent property (samaveta- dharma) can be the delimitor of lakṣyata, the agantuka- dharma of the cows which is free from the defects namely over-application (ativyāpti), narrow-application (a-vyāpti) and non-application (asambhava). 



An avacchedaka should be free from these defects too. 



Gotva is free from these three defects and hence it can be the delimitor of lakṣyatā. 



gotva 



(avacchedaka) 



go 



lakṣyatā 



(avacchinna) 



(lakṣya) 



Now, we know clearly that we are going to define a 'cow'. 



The next issue is which peculiar property of cow can be identified as the definition of cow, since there are several features in cow. 



The method by which such a property is to be identified is to verify whether a property selected as 'the definition' is co-extensive with the delimitor of the lakṣyata or not. If it is co-extensive, it should be selected as a definition without any problem. 



The test of co-extensiveness (samaniyatatva) is to see that 'wherever there is the defining feature (asādhāraṇa- dharma), there is the delimitor of the lakṣyatā and 



19Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



wherever there is the delimitor of the lakṣyata, there is the defining feature'. If this is true, one can select that feature (asādhāraṇa-dharma) as the definition of the thing to be defined. 



(In our example, gala-kambala or sāsnā (dewlap) can be that defining feature because it satisfies the above-mentioned test. Wherever there is dewlap there is 'cowness' and wherever there is cowness there is dewlap. Thus, 'dewlap' is co-extensive (samaniyata) with 'cowness and hence dewlap can be treated as the definition of a cow. 



If anybody defines a cow as 'that which possesses horns' this definition will apply to not only cows but to any other animal also which has horns, which is not desirable. Here, arises a defect called ativyāpti (over-application) which is defined as: 



lakṣya-alakṣya-vṛttitvam ativyāptiḥ. 



"The defect of a definition called 'over-application' is that where the definition applies in that which is to be defined (lakṣya) and also in that which is not intended to be defined (a-lakṣya)'. 



lakṣaṇa 



(lakṣya) 



(a-lakṣya) 



A definition should be free from this defect. 



[[20]]



English Translation with Notes 



Again, if some one defines a cow as 'that animal which possesses white colour' it will apply only to white cows and not to cows having other colour'. Thus, this definition suffers from the defect of avyāpti (narrow-application), 



which is defined as: 



lakṣyaikadeśa-avṛttitvam avyāptiḥ 



'That which is not present in all that is intended to be defined' i.e. not present in a part of it.' It can be put as 



follows: 



lakṣaṇa 



(lakṣyaikadeśa) 



(lakṣya) 



A proper definition must avoid this defect. 



Similarly, if some one defines a cow as 'that animal which has cloven hooves,' it will not apply to any cow because it suffers from the defect called asambhava which 



is defined as: 



lakṣyamatra-avṛttitvam asambhavaḥ. 



'Non-application is that defect of a definition where the definition does not apply to any case which is intended to be defined.' 



[[21]]



To put it diagrammatically: 



lakṣaṇa 



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



(lakṣya) 



(alakṣya) 



This defect should also be avoided. Therefore, it is said that only that peculiar property can be a perfect definition which is free from all these three types of defects. dosa-traya-rahitaḥ asādhāraṇa-dharmo lakṣaṇam. 



Gandha 'smell is such a property in 



a property in terms of which 'earth' can be defined. The earth possesses the following qualities: colour, taste, smell, touch, number, size, discreteness, conjunction, disjunction, remoteness, nearness, weight and fluidity. Smell is called the special quality of the earth. That is why earth could be defined in terms of smell. Ordinarity, a quality in the paramāņu is taken as permanant. But rupa, rasa, gandha and sparśa of the atoms of the earth cannot be treated as permanant because they can change by heating.

Water is that which possesses cold touch. It is of two types: Eternal and non-eternal. Eternal forms of water would be atoms of water and non-eternal forms of water would be effects or products or masses made out of those atoms. Again we classify water-bodies in three groups viz. bodies made of water, the sense organ made of water and objects made of water. The body made of water is to be found in the world of Varuņa; the sense organ is the organ of taste which we all have and that is located at the tip of the tongue; the objects made of water are the water bodies like river, ocean etc.

In Sanskrit the word apaḥ is always used in plural. The stem (prātipadika) is ap 'water'.

Water can have the following qualities: rūpa, rasa, sparśa, sankhyā, parimāṇa, pṛthaktva, samyoga, vibhāga, paratva, aparatva, gurutva, dravatva, sneha. 



It is interesting to note that the Nyaya-Vaiseṣika systems even respect mythological information. The Vedic and Puranic traditions mention varuṇa-loka, 'world of varuna', aditya-loka, 'world of sun' and vayu-loka, 'world of vayu' where bodies made of water, fire and air respectively can be found. The Indian logicians have given space for these mythological entities as well. 



This clearly shows how comprehensive is the canvas of the Indian logicians who do not want to ignore cultural inputs of any source: literature, social belief, folklore, mythology. They have shown respect by offering a space for these items in their structure of ontological analysis. This is something unique.

Fire or heat or light is that which possesses hot touch. It is of two kinds: eternal and non-eternal. The eternal form of light are the atoms of light and the non-eternal form of light are the mass made of those atoms.

The body made of light can be seen in the region of the Sun; the sense organ made of light are our eyes which reveal colour and that is located at the tip of the pupil of the eyes. The objects made of light are of four types viz. ordinary fire, celestial light, and minerals. The fire of the first category is our ordinary fire, of the second category is the celestial lightening which is produced by water and of the third category the heat i.e. digestive fire in our stomach which causes the digestion of the food that we eat and the fourth category is the minerals such as gold etc.

May be, at the time of Kaṇāda, the knowledge of Physics was of that level. We will have to understand the text in that light. These ancient texts are not the reports of any physical laboratory and hence one should not try to read modern science there. 



But in any case, the logical method of enquiry needs to be appreciated. 



Fire can have the following qualities: rūpa, sparśa, sankhyā, parimāṇa, pṛthaktva, saṁyoga, vibhāga, paratva, aparatva and sāṁsiddhika-dravatva (fluidity caused by heat since gold is also treated as fire).

Air is that substance which possesses touch but does not possess colour. It is of two kinds: eternal and non-eternal. Eternal air is in the form of atoms of air and non-eternal in the form of effect or product. Again air can be classified into three types viz. body made of air, sense organ made of air, and objects made of air. The body made of air is to be found in the vāyu-loka, the sense organ made of air is our faculty of touch which reveals touch, it is present throughout our body. The object made of air can be identified in the cause of shaking of tree etc. and our breathing air which moves inside our body. Although air is one mass we call it by different names such as prāṇa (breathing air) apāna (the gas which passes through our anal) etc. due to the extraneous factors (upadhi). 



Notes: 13 



Air has the following qualities: sparśa, sankhyā, parimāṇa, pṛthaktva, samyoga, vibhāga, paratva, and aparatva. 



The air which is moving inside the body is called prāṇa (breath). Although it is one, it is known by different names in terms of the regions through which it passes. The names 



are: 



(i) prāṇa (ii) apāna (iii) samāna (iv) udāna (v) vyāna. The commentary called Nrsimha-prakāśikā on the Tarkasangrahadipikā explains it as follows: hṛdi vṛttitvāt mukhanāsikābhyām niṣkramanāt praveśanat ca prāṇa ityucyate. gudasthānavṛttitvat malādīnām adhonayanāt 



[[27]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa

sarvasarīravṛttitvāt sarvanāḍīṣu praveśanācca vyāna iti 



ucyate. 



Thus, breathing air is prāṇa; the wind passing through anus is apāna; the air that activates the digestive fire in the stomach is called samana; the air near the region of ears is called udāna; and the wind which moves throughout the body including the veins (nāḍī) is called vyāna.

Sky or ether is that substance which is the material cause of sound i.e. one, all-pervading and eternal. 



Notes: 14 



Sound is produced in the sky and sky is the material cause (samavāyi-kāraṇa). 



Sky is to be understood as vibhu which is defined as 'that which is connected with all substances having a limited size (murta-dravya). Sky is also said to be eternal. The concept of nitya is 'that which never becomes the counter-positive (pratiyogin) of destruction. In other words that which is never destroyed is called eternal.

Time is that substance which causes us to refer to past, present and future. That is one, all-pervading and eternal. 



Notes: 15 



Everything comes into being in time. That is why, time is said to be the locus of everything. The whole universe is in time. This time is called mahākāla. Our reference to segments of time in ordinary language is the reference to khaṇḍa-kāla (assumed unit of time in terms of the sun-rise and sun-set). As a matter of fact, time is indivisible, eternal, one and vibhu like the sky.

Space is that substance which causes the reference to directions such as east, west, north, south etc. that space is one all-pervading and eternal. 



Notes: 16 



Dis is direction or space. Language presents reference to it by referring to different directions such as east, west, north, 



29Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



south etc. The Nrsimha-prakāśikā commentary provides an easy way to identify the space. He says that when we refer to some entity in a language, it is done in terms of the delimitor of the property of being usable in language (vyavahartavyatā-avacchedaka). 



Here the vyavahartavya is say, prāg-dig-vān 'possessing eastern direction' that is pratīcī ‘east' and the property of being vyavahartavya that is vyavahartavyatā is in prāg-dig-vat i.e. in something that exists in the east and there the delimitor of vyavahartavyatā is, therefore, prāgdik. 



Thus, to refer to ‘east' we need to have an entity called prācī. As we need ghatatva to refer to ghata, so we need diś to refer to direction or space.

Colour is that quality which is revealed by eyes alone. Colour is of seven types white, blue, yellow, red, green, brown and mixed colour (citra). Colour is found in earth, water, and light. In the earth, all the seven can be found, in water non-radiant white, in light radiant white. 



34English Translation with Notes 



Notes: 19 



Colour can be known only by eyes. That is why, a blind person cannot have a perception of colour, although he can have perception through other sense-organs like touch, ears, nose and tongue. Some qualities can be known by more than one sense-faculty, e.g. 'number'. It can be known by eyes and by 'touch'.

Cold in water, hot in heat and warm in earth and air. colour, taste, smell and touch found in the earth are changeable or transformable by heating, elsewhere however, they are not transformable and hence either eternal or non-eternal. They are eternal when they are situated in eternal substances and they are non-eternal when they are situated in non-eternal substances.

Number is that quality in terms of which reference like 1,2,3....etc. is made. It exists in all these nine substances. The range of numbers, known in the tradition, is from 1 upto parardha (i.e. 1016). Number one is a basic number and it is eternal when it exists in eternal substance and it is non-eternal when it exists in non-eternal substance. All higher numbers starting from two are non-eternal. 



[[38]]



English Translation with Notes 



Notes: 23 



Each individual entity possesses 'number one'. If the locus of number 'one' is non-eternal like any product, it will be non-eternal; but if the locus is eternal such as time, space, self etc. it will be eternal. From number two onwards all higher numbers are constructed and hence non-eternal. Number can be revealed by eyes as well as by faculty of touch. This is a proof that number is the part of external reality.

This is comparable to the idea of size or 'extension'. 



There can be three types of size: minimum possible size; maximum possible size and middle size. 



An atom is of the minimum possible size; a pot has middle size and time, space, self etc. are of maximum possible size.

Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



They are of two types: spatial and temporal. When something is at a far distance there is remoteness in it. That remoteness is a spatial remoteness. When something is at a closer distance there is nearness in it and this nearness is also caused by space. With reference to a person who is senior in age there is temporal remoteness in him and in a younger person there is temporal nearness.

Fluidity is the non-material cause of the first moment of flowing of a liquid substance. It exists in earth, water and fire or light. That is of two kinds: natural and incidental. The natural fluidity is found in water and incidental or caused fluidity is found in earth and fire. The fluidity in the earth is caused by contact with fire as in the case of ghee etc. and the fluidity in fire is seen in mineral substance gold etc.

Remembrance is that cognition which is caused by impressions alone left behind by experiences. whatever is not remembrance is an experience. That is also of two types: true and false. 



Notes: 34 



Cognition is an experience. It comes and goes. But before vanishing it leaves behind some impressions which cause remembrance later. Thus, cognition other than remembrance is called experience which may be true or false. Similarly, remembrance produced by impressions which are left behind by a true experience is also true and a remembrance produced by impressions left behind by a false experience is false.

A true experience is that which reflects the qualifier in its own locus. This is called knowledge. For example the knowledge of 'this is silver' in silver.

English Translation with Notes 



Notes: 35 



If there is a reality say, 'x' in this world and when I know it, if it appears as 'x', this cognition will be called a true cognition. 



To explain: Every entity which is referred to by language in this world exists with the following structure: 



dharma 



sambandha 



dharmin 



Thus, 'pot' exists as 



potness 



pot 



inherence 



If it is the case that when this 'pot' is internalized by say, the process of perception, it goes inside the cognition and reflects the same structure such as 



potness 



inherence 



pot 



cognition of pot 



[[47]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



We can say that this is a true cognition where 'potness' (x-ness) has appeared in its own locus (x). 



The definition may be understood as follows: 



Tat = x - ness 



Tad-vat = x (= possessor of x-ness) 



x-ness is the qualification of x and so in the cognition of x, if x-ness appears as the qualifier it is to be treated as a true cognition or experience. 



For instance if 'silverness' appears in the knowledge of its own locus i.e. silver it will be called the true cognition of 'silver' where tat means 'silverness' 



silverness 



silver 



Tad-vat 



(This is silver)

A false cognition is that experience which reflects qualifier in a locus which, in fact, possesses absence of that qualifier. This is called an error or erroneous cognition. 



Notes: 36 



But if it is a case that 'silverness' appears in the cognition which emerges after looking at a conch-shell by mistake, this cognition of 'silver' will be called a false cognition because here 'silverness' has appeared in the locus where there is absence of 'silverness' since that locus (the conch-shell is not the natural locus of 'silverness') 



To put it diagrammatically, 



silvernes 



absence 



conch-shell 



(This is silver (error)) 



Where tat is 'silver-ness' 



Observe that even an erroneous cognition can prompt 



human behavior. 



In any case of behavior, the prompting cognition must be a verbalizable cognition because it is the verbalizable cognition or a savikalpaka-jñāna which presents the world clearly with a name and a form.

A true cognition is of four types: 



(i) perceptual 



(ii) inferential 



(iii) analogical and 



(iv) verbal. 



The instrument that is, the process through which these four types of cognitions are produced is also of four types viz. pratyakṣa, anumāna, upamāna, and śabda. 



Notes: 37 



There are four processes of internalizing the world. Internalizing means making the world an object of cognition. Each process generates a distinct type of cognition. Thus, the world can be an object of a perceptual cognition, or an inferential cognition or an analogical cognition or a verbal understanding. The Nyāya Vaiseṣika system accepts only four types of cognition and corresponding to these four types, they accept only four processes of internalizing i.e. only four pramāņas.

An instrument or process is that uncommon factor which is involved in a function. A cause is that which invariably precedes an effect. An effect is that which is the counter-positive of a pre-absence. Cause is of three kinds (i) material (ii) non-material and (iii) efficient. 



The material cause is that where an effect is produced by the relationship of inherence. For example the threads are the material cause of cloth and cloth is the material cause of its colour. 



The non-material cause is that which exists in a locus of either the effect or the cause. For e.g., the contact of the threads is the non-material cause of the cloth and the colour of the thread is the non-material cause of the colour of the cloth. An efficient cause is that which is different from both these varieties e.g. the instruments of the weavers are the efficient cause of cloth. Of these three types of cause whatever is uncommon is called an instrument.

A cause is a factor or a karaka which is involved in producing an effect. Pramāņa or the process of

English Translation with Notes 



internalizing the world is an instrumental case (karaṇa- kāraka). 



What is instrumentality? There are several notions of instrumentality. We may discuss here some of them. Let us take the following: 



(1) phalayoga-vyavacchinnaṁ kāraṇaṁ karaṇam (2) vyāpāravadasādhāraṇaṁ kāraṇaṁ karaṇam (3) samagrīkaraṇam 



Let us say that x produces y through z. This can be presented as follows: 



X 



Z 



y 



Here x is the function (vyāpāra) of x . 



If z is a function it should satisfy the two following 



conditions: 



it has to be produced by x and it will produce y which is produced by x. 



The śastric formulation of the concept of vyāpāra goes like this - tajjanyatve sati tajjanyajanakaḥ vyāpāraḥ. 



where tat means x and the first tat-janya stands for z and the second tajjanya stands for y. 



Thus, the definition of vyāpāra will read like the following: 



Vyāpāra is that which is produced by x and which produces y which is also produced by x. 



Here, if we apply the first notion of karana stated above (1) we will identify z as the instrumental case 



[[53]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



because immediately after z, y comes into being. That is an instrument immediately after which the result comes into being. Thus, vyāpāra is an instrument according to this view. 



If we apply the concept (2) mentioned above, x will become the instrument because it is x which is involved in the function of z. And if we apply the third concept (3) mentioned above the collection of all factors leading to y will be considered to be the karaṇa-kāraka. 



What we find here in this text of Tarkasangraha is the second concept of karaņa is applied. 



A cause is that which invariably precedes its effect and which is not redundant either. 



A substance alone can be the material cause and quality and action only can be a non-material cause. 



The following illustrations will make the concept clear. 



Material cause 



(whole) 



cloth 



(effect) 



inherence 



(parts) 



threads 



(material cause) 



Here, the whole namely, the cloth is produced in the 



threads by the relation of inherence. Therefore, threads are the material cause of cloth. 



54English Translation with Notes 



Non-material cause 



inherence 



(effect) 



color 



inherence 



(whole) 



cloth 



color 



(cause) 



(parts) 



threads 



Here, the colour of the threads is the non-material cause of the effect namely, the colour of the cloth because the colour of the thread exists in the same locus by inherence where the material cause (i.e. the cloth) of the effect i.e. the colour of the cloth also exists. The material as well as the non-material cause of the colour of the cloth exist in one and the same locus namely, the threads. 



color 



cloth 



Inherence 



inherence 



threads 



This is how the colour of the threads get related to the cloth. 



All other factors needed to produce an effect are grouped in one box called auxiliary cause or efficient cause. 



All effects are analyzed in this system in terms of these three types of causes, material, non-material and auxiliary.

Translation: 39 



Pratyakṣa is the instrument or process of perceptual cognition. A perceptual cognition is that cognition which is produced by the contact between the sense organ and the object. That is of two kinds: non-verbalizable and verbalizable. A non-verbalizable cognition is that which does not present its content in the form of qualifier and qualificand. A verbalizable cognition on the other hand is that cognition which reflects its content in the form of qualifier and qualificand type. For example this is X (dittha); He is a brāhmin; He is black; He is a cook, and 



so on. 



Notes: 39 



The process of acquiring the cognition of the world directly by the sense-organs is called pratyakṣa-pramāņa and the resultant cognition produced by such process is called pratyakṣa-jñāna. 



[[56]]



English Translation with Notes 



The factors involved in this process are self, mind, senses and their objects. Self gets connected with the mind, mind with the sense, sense with its object and what immediately emerges is an indeterminate perceptual cognition and this cognition produced a determinate perceptual cognition. An indeterminate cognition is called nirvikalpaka-pratyakṣa and a determinate cognition is called savikalpaka-pratyakṣa. An indeterminate cognition cannot be expressed in language whereas a determinate cognition can be verbalized in language. 



An indeterminate perception cannot be expressed in language because the content of an indeterminate cognition does not reflect a structure of qualifier-and qualified (dharma-dharmi-bhāvāpanna). Suppose, one sees a flower, the first perception that arises may be presented something like the following: 



flower-ness 



inherence 



flower 



Here, all the three entities appear in the cognition, but they do not reflect a structure. But this cognition produces another cognition where the content reflects the structure clearly. The same indeterminate cognition produces the following cognition. 



[[57]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



flower-ness 



flower 



inherence 



This is a flower 



Here, the content-structure is very clear. It has reflected that 'flowerness' appears as the qualifier, 'inherence' as the relation and the locus of flowerness as 'flower'. That is, only such cognitions which are also called savikalpakajñāna are verbalizable in language. 



The nirvikalpaka-jñāna is said to be the cause of savikalpaka-jñāna. 



A determinate cognition is also called visiṣṭa-jñāna where qualifier, qualificand and the relation between them are reflected. For a qualified cognition the knowledge of the qualification is the cause and a cause has to precede its effect. Therefore, an indeterminate cognition precedes a determinate cognition. An indeterminate cognition is inferred. It cannot be perceived by even mind.

The contact between a sense-organ and its object which is the cause of perceptual cognition is of six types: 



59Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



(i) contact (samyoga) 



(ii) contact-cum-inherence (samyukta-samavāya) 



(iii) 



contact-cum-inherence-cum-inherence (samyukta-samaveta-samavāya) 



(iv) inherence (samavāya) 



(v) inherence-cum-inherence (samaveta-samavāya) (vi) the relationship of qualifier and qualificand type 



(viśeṣaṇa-viśesyabhava) 



Samyoga is that contact by which our eyes produce the perception of a pot. With reference to colour of pot contact-cum-inherence is the connection (sannikarṣa). Because, the colour in the pot which is connected with the eyes exists in the pot by the relation of inherence. With reference to the perception of universal called colourness the contact-cum-inherence-cum-inherence is the connection. Because, the colour exists by inherence in the pot which is connected with the eyes and in the colour colourness exists by the relationship of inherence. With reference to perception of sound by the ears the inherence is the connection. Because, ears are nothing but the ether in the hole of the ears and sound is the quality of the ether and inherence is the relationship between quality and the substance. With reference to perception of soundness inherence-cum-inherence is the connection because, in the sound which is inherent in the ears the soundness exists by inherence. With reference to perception of the negative entity called 'absence' the connection is the relationship of 



[[60]]



English Translation with Notes 



qualifier and qualificand. For instance, when we look at the ground and say, there is no pot on the ground our eyes are connected with the ground and on that ground the absence of pot appears as a qualifier. Thus, a perceptual cognition is that cognition which is produced by these six types of connections (between the sense organ and its object). The instrument or process of that perception is our senses. That is why, sense organs are called pratyakṣa-pramāṇa. 



Notes: 40 



The six contacts with the sense-organs can be shown as follows: Suppose, it is the case of perceiving the flower, the contact of the eyes with the flower will be the contact: 



eyes 



contact 



flowerness 



inherence 



flower 



If one sees the red colour of the flower the contact will be 



the following: 



red color 



inherence 



eyes 



flower 



contact

[[62]]



English Translation with Notes 



eyes 



viśeṣaṇatā 



absence of pot 



(viseṣaṇa) 



svarūpa 



ground 



contact 



(connected) 



Here, the eyes are 



connected with the ground and 'the absence of pot' appears as a qualification to the ground because we say 'ghaṭābhāvavadbhūtalam' 'the ground qualified by the absence of pot.' Hence, the contact between the eyes and the absence of pot will be cakṣuḥ-samyukta-viseṣaṇatā. 



All these six types of contacts are the functions of the sense-organs and according to the second notion of instrumentality, the senses will become the pratyakṣa-pramāņa since they are vyāpāravat.

Translation: 41 



The instrument or the process which produces the inferential cognition is called anumana. An inferential cognition is that cognition which is produced by a confirmatory 'cognition' (parāmarśa). A confirmatory cognition is that cognition which reveals the existence of probans qualified by the invariable relationship called vyāpti on the subject (pakṣa). For example the 'cognition' viz. 'this mountain possesses smoke which is pervaded by fire' is a confirmatory 'cognition.' The cognition produced by that viz. 'this mountain possesses fire' will be an inferential ‘cognition' 'Wherever there is smoke, there is fire,' this type of invariable relationship of collocation is called vyapti. The existence of the pervaded (vyāpya) on the mountain is called pakṣa-dharmatā. 



Notes: 41 



We can know say, 'fire' through our eyes and if some one keeps the same fire beyond the range of our eyes, in a bush and if you say we see the smoke produced by that fire, again we can know the same 'fire'. The first knowledge of fire is called perceptual knowledge of fire. Why? Because the process through which the second knowledge of fire has arisen is different from the process through which the first knowledge arose. In the case of first knowledge, there was direct contact of the sense organ with the fire, but in 



64English Translation with Notes 



the second case, in spite of the absence of direct contact, there has arisen the knowledge of fire. Therefore, it is the process that contributes to the difference in the genre of a cognition or knowledge. The second process is the process of inference in the above case. When there is a process it has to have a sequence or steps. The Indian logicians have identified the following steps in this process: 



After a person has acquired the knowledge of the invariable relationship between 'smoke' and 'fire' through repeated observations sees a 'smoke' on the mountain, the process begins. 



Step I: seeing the smoke on the mountain 



Step II: remembering the invariable relationship between the smoke and the fire. 



Step III: confirming that such a smoke which possesses 



that relationship exists on the mountain. 



Step IV: concluding that there is 'fire' on the mountain. This is a psychological process in the sense that the observer of 'smoke' has come to the conclusion that 'there is fire on the mountain' mentally. To put it diagrammatically: 



Step I: 



smoke

(The mountain has smoke)

Translation: 42 



Anumāna or inference is of two types: (i) called svārtha (for convincing oneself) and (ii) parārtha (for convincing others). The first variety i.e. svartha is the cause of inferential 'cognition' for oneself. To explain, when someone through repeated observation viz. wherever there is smoke there is fire as in kitchen etc. grasps the invariable relationship between smoke and fire, approaches a mountain and looks at the smoke on the mountain, initially he is in a doubt, whether there is fire in the mountain and consequently remembers the invariable relationship viz. 'wherever there is smoke there is fire.' And after that a 'cognition' viz. 'this mountain possesses smoke which is pervaded by fire' arises in him. This very 'cognition' is technically called linga-parāmarśa. After this 'cognition' the inferential 'cognition' 'the mountain possesses fire' arises. This is the process of svārtha-anumāna. 



After having inferred fire on the basis of a smoke when someone 



wants to convince others by using 



[[68]]



English Translation with Notes 



a set of five sentences that process of inference is called parartha-anumana. For example: (i) the mountain possesses fire (ii) because it possesses smoke (iii) whatever possesses smoke possesses fire e.g. kitchen (iv) such is this (mountain) (v) therefore, this mountain possesses fire. By this set of five sentences when the ground (linga) is stated even others can come to know fire. These five sentence are technically called by five names such as, (i) pratijñā (roughly a proposition) (ii) hetu (ground or mark or reason) (iii) udāharaṇa (example) to demonstrate the invariable relationship between probans and probandum (iv) upanaya (confirmatory sentence) (v) nigamana (conclusion). 



Thus, the mountain possesses fire is pratijñā because it possesses smoke is hetu, whatever possesses smoke, possesses fire, kitchen is an udāharaṇa such is the mountain is called upanaya, therefore, this mountain possesses fire is nigamana. The instrument or process of both the inferential cognition produced by svartha-anumāna and the inferential cognition produced by parartha-anumāna is nothing but the confirmatory cognition namely, linga-parāmarśa. That is why, linga-paramarśa is called 



anumāna. 



Notes: 42 



When the process is mental i.e. when someone is mentally deducing for one's own knowledge, the process is called svārthānumāna. But once he is convinced and when he tries to convince others he utters a set of five sentences 



69Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



and this set of five sentences is a process and this process is called pararthānumāna, the process through which one tries to convince others. 



Each sentence of this set is a part or a step in that process and hence it is called an avayava (part of the process). 



The five steps in this process are: 



Step I: the claim or the statement that is going to be proved 



(pratijñā). 



Step II: the ground for the claim. 



Step III: example to demonstrate the invariable relation- ship between the ground and the claim. 



Step IV: confirming that the ground provided does have 



such relationship and such a ground is present in 



the case under consideration. 



Step V: confirming the claim. 



Although these steps are five sentences, the process is not the process of sabdapramāņa. Each sentence generates śābdabodha no doubt, but that understanding is a step that contributes to the next step in the process of inference. That is why, the five sentences together is called a single sentence (pañcāvayava-vākya). Therefore, here the terms vākya should not be taken in the ordinary sense of a sentence, but in the sense of inferential process, the process of deduction. There is a traditional debate with the Bhaṭṭa school of Purvamīmāmsā regarding the number of steps in inferential process. 



[[70]]



English Translation with Notes 



While the Indian logicians insist that all the five steps mentioned above are absolutely necessary, the Bhāṭṭa school thinks that either the first three steps from the beginning or the last three steps starting from example will be sufficient to account for the entire process. 



I personally think that the Indian logician's stand is more rational because it leads to establish a universal theory of inference applicable to all cases uniformly. For further reading one can look into Śaśadhara's Paramarśavāda included in his Nyayasiddhantadīpa.

A linga or mark or ground or reason is of three types (i) anvayavyatirekin, (which exhibits both positive and negative concomitance) (ii) kevalānvayin (which exhibits only positive concomitance), and (iii) kevalavyatirekin (which demonstrates only negative concomitance). Anvayavyatirekin is that ground which possesses both the positive and negative concomitance e.g. when fire is to be established on the basis of smoke, smoke is said to be such ground. Here, it can be demonstrated that wherever there is smoke there is fire as in the case of kitchen. And it can also be demonstrated where there is no fire there is no smoke as in a big lake (the first is the demonstration of positive concomitance and the second is the demonstration of negative concomitance). The kevalānvayin ground is that ground which possesses only positive concomitance e.g. when we infer the "pot is expressible in language because it is an object of a true cognition" like a cloth. Here, one cannot demonstrate the negative concomitance between the "state "of being the object of true cognition" and the "state of being expressible in language" because 



[[72]]



English Translation with Notes 



everything in this universe is both content or object of a true cognition and it is expressible in language. 



Kevalavyatirekin is that ground which possesses negative concomitance only. For instance, when one infers "earth is different from non-earth" because, it possesses smell. Whatever is not different from non-earth does not possess smell e.g. water. The earth is not like that and therefore, it is not different from non-earth. Here, there is no example to demonstrate 'whatever possess smell is different from non-earth.' Because the entire earth is the subject (paksa). 



Notes: 43 



A ground (linga), the knowledge of which leads to the knowledge of probandum (sadhya or lingin) is of three types because it has those types of relationship (vyāpti) with the probandum. 



In the first kind of relationship one can demonstrate the following: 



yatra yatra hetuḥ tatra tatra sadhyam and also 



yatra sadhyam nasti tatra hetuḥ nästi 



Here, the first statement is called the statement of anvaya-vyāpti and the second one, the statement of vyatireka-vyapti. 



'Wherever there is x, there is y', if it is true, the relationship is called anvaya-vyapti. 



But 'where there is no x, there is no y' if it is true, it is said to have vyatireka-vyapti.

If it is so then in the above example of inferring fire on the basis of smoke, why is the vyatireka demonstration not made as: yatra dhūmaḥ nāsti tatra vahniḥ nästi? 



The reason behind this is the following fact: 



(a) In some cases, the area of existence of the ground and that of a probandum are one and the same. For instance, if someone wants to establish 'non eternality (anityatva) on the basis of its 'being a product' (kṛtakatva) one can demonstrate the positive (anvaya) and negative (vyatireka) relations without any problem. 



yatra yatra kṛtakatvam tatra tatra anityatvam as is the case of a pot and also yatra yatra kṛtakatvam nāsti tatra tatra anityatvam nāsti as in the case of 'sky' 



There is no need of saying here yatra yatra anityatvam nāsti tatra tatra kṛtakatvam nāsti. Because, it is a case of sama-vyāpti which can be demonstrated as follows: 



kṛtakatva 



anityatva 



Here the same circle is the area of kṛtakatva and the same is the area of anityatva. Therefore, the relationship between them is symmetrical. 



But the case of inferring 'fire' on the basis of 'smoke' does not hold the symmetrical relationship. The relationship between smoke and fire is of the following type: 



74English Translation with Notes 



fire 



smoke 



B 



A 



The area of fire is the entire circle of A, but the area of smoke is the circle of B. It means 'fire' exists in the area of smoke also whereas smoke does not exist in the area of 'fire'. Therefore, I can say, wherever there is 'smoke', there is 'fire', but I cannot say 'wherever there is no 'smoke', there is no 'fire', since there are cases where 'fire' remains without smoke such as a hot iron ball' (tapta-ayogolaka). 



[[6]]



In order to include both, symmetrical as well as a-symmetrical relationship, the Indian logician proposed the following form of testing relationships: 



Wherever there is x, there is y and wherever there is no y, there is no x. 



This can be applicable to both kṛtakatva as well as 



'smoke'. 



But there is a case where the method cannot be applicable even though it is a case of symmetrical relationship. For instance, the case of inferring knowability on the basis of 'namability' or vice-a-versa. 



[[75]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



Although anvaya-statement is possible here, the vyatireka-statement is not possible because no example can be cited to demonstrate such a relationship. 



Similarly, there is a case where a vyatireka statement alone is possible to be demonstrated, and not the anvaya-statement. For instance, when someone infers 'This earth is different from all that is not earth, because it has smell.' 



Here, anvaya-statement is not possible since the entire earth is taken here as pakṣa and an example must be different from the pakṣa which is not possible in this case. 



That is why, a ground is said to be of three types: (1) anvaya-vyatirekin, like 'smoke' 



(2) kevala-anvayin, like knowability or namability and (3) kevala-vyatirekin, like 'smell' in the respective cases 



mentioned above. 



In other words, the first variety of ground has both, the positive as well as the negative concomitance (vyāpti), the second type of ground has only the positive concomitance and the third type has only negative concomitance.

Translation: 44 



A pakṣa is that which possesses probandum about which there is doubt. For example, when fire is to be inferred the mountain on the basis of smoke, mountain is called pakṣa. Sapaksa is that which possesses the probandum where there is no doubt about its existence. For instance in the same above example, the kitchen is called sapakṣa. Vipakṣa is that which possesses the absence of probandum about which there is no doubt. For instance in the same example the big lake is called vipakṣa. 



Notes: 44 



Pakṣa is that locus where the sadhya is to be established. This may be called the subject where the sadhya is predicated. 



The doubtful locus of the sadhya is a pakṣa. This is an older idea of pakṣa. According to the newer idea, a pakṣa is that which possesses pakṣatā, and the pakṣatā is formulated in the following way: 







Paksatā the absence of the knowledge of the sadhya qualified by the absence of the desire to establish the sādhya. 



Suppose, the desire to establish the sadhya is A; and the knowledge of sadhya is B, in that case the definition of pakṣatā can be put as follows: 



- ( - A + B) = pakṣatā 



[[77]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



where'+' stands for viśista and '-' stands for absence. 



It implies that there can be four possibilities when there are two variables: 



(a) + A + B 



(b) + A - B 



(c) - A + B 



(d) - A - B 



(a) reads there is desire to prove the sadhya and there 



is knowledge of sadhya. 



(b) says that there is desire to prove and there is no 



knowledge of sadhya. 



(c) says that there is no desire to prove and there is 



already the knowledge of sadhya and 



(d) reads that there is neither the desire to prove nor 



there is knowledge of sadhya. 



The formulation of - ( A + B) will indicate (a), (b) and (d) and in all these three cases there will be inference. In the case of (c), however, the inferential process will not work because the sādhya is already known and there is no desire to know either. 



The most important factor is the desire to prove. If there is desire, irrespective of the fact, whether the sādhya is known or not, the process of inference will work. Sometimes, in spite of the absence of desire, if there is no knowledge of sadhya the inferential process works. 



When some one is inside a room and comes to know that there are clouds in the sky on the basis of the sound of lightening it will be the example of (d); when there is 



[[78]]



English Translation with Notes 



knowledge of fire on the basis of smoke, it is an example of (b) and if someone asks to prove fire again in spite of the knowledge of fire, it will be an example of (a). 



Sapakṣa is a locus like kitchen where the co-existence of smoke with fire is known. 



Vipaksa is the locus where it is known, for certain, that the sadhya does not exist. For instance, the lake where it is known that 'fire' does not exist. 



The popular example of an inference is as follows: 



(1) The mountain possesses fire 



(2) Because it has smoke 



(3) Whenever there is smoke, there is fire like a 



kitchen 



(4) There is such a smoke which is pervaded by fire 



on this mountain. 



(5) Therefore, there is fire on the mountain 



To put it diagrammatically:

savyabhicara-viruddha-satpratipakṣa-asiddha-badhitāḥ 



pañca hetvābhāsāḥ. 



Translation: 45 



There are five types of fallacious grounds viz. 



(i) savyabhicāra (which suffers from inconsistency) (ii) viruddha (opposite) 



(iii) satpratipakṣa (which has parallel counter-argument) (iv) asiddha (unestablished or unknown) and 



(v) badhita (contradicted). 



Notes: 45 



There is a notion of a good ground and a bad ground. A good ground is that the knowledge of which leads to the knowledge of sadhya. A bad ground does not do that job. A good ground is called sad-hetu and a bad ground is called asad-hetu. A sad-hetu is that which possesses an invariable relationship with sadhya and an asad-hetu is that which does not possess such a relationship and hence can be called a fallacious ground. Bad grounds are of five types which will be illustrated in the next text 46. 



Savyabhicāra means 'inconsistent', 'variable' 'irregular'. Knowledge of such a ground cannot generate inferential knowledge. 



For instance, one cannot know smoke from the knowledge of fire, because it is not true that wherever there 



[[80]]



English Translation with Notes 



is fire, there is smoke. In other words, fire does not have invariable relationship with smoke because fire can remain without smoke. Hence, 'fire' will be treated as an asad-hetu for knowing 'smoke'. 



Viruddha means 'opposite' or 'contradictory'. Such a ground proves just opposite of what is intended to be proved. For example, if some one says that 'the pot is eternal, because it is 'produced', the ground namely, 'the fact that' it is produced will prove that the pot is not eternal, which is just opposite of what is intended to be produced.' 



Sat-prati-pakṣa means 'which has a counter ground to disprove what is intended to be proved.' For instance, if a Mīmāṁsaka says that 'sound is eternal because it is an object of auditory perception like soundness, the Naiyāyikas may forward another ground namely, 'the fact that sound is an effect' which will disprove what was intended to be proved by the Mīmāṁsakas. 



Asiddha means 'unestablished or unknown'. Thus, if someone says that knowledge is a quality because it is an object of visual perception, he cannot prove it because the ground given itself is not established or known since knowledge can be known only by mind and not by eyes. 



Bādhita means 'already known to be false by some other process of knowing'. For example, if some one says that fire is cold, because it is a substance, he cannot establish it because one can verify by touching fire that 



what is intended to be established is not true. In a broad 



[[81]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



way, this is the idea behind an asad-hetu that it cannot lead one to establish the sadhya which is intended to be established on the basis of that ground or hetu. The details of this are discussed in the texts from 46 to 50.

Translation: 46 



The savyabhicara is also called anaikāntika. That is of three types: (i) sādhārana ( inconsistent in a general way) (ii) asādhārana (inconsistent in a unique way) and (iii) anupasaṁhārin (inconclusive). The sadhāraṇa type of fallacious ground is that which exists in a locus where 



[[82]]



English Translation with Notes 



there is no probandum. For example if some one says the mountain has fire because it has the state of being the object of true cognition the ground viz. the state of being an object of true cognition is a fallacious ground because the state of being the object of true cognition is also present in the lake where there is no fire. The asādhāraṇa type of fallacious ground is that which does not exist either in sapakṣa or in vipaksa. 



For instance, if some one says that sound is eternal because it has soundness, this ground will suffer from that defect. Here, the ground viz. soundness excludes all loci eternal and non-eternal and exists only in the sound. The anupasaṁhārin type of fallacious ground is that which is devoid of examples which can demonstrate positive and negative concomitance. For example if someone says all this is non-eternal because it has the state of being the object of a true cognition, such a ground suffers from that defect. Here, since everything becomes subject (pakṣa) no example can be given to demonstrate either positive or negative concomitance.

Translation: 47 



A viruddha type of fallacious ground is that ground which is pervaded by the absence of probandum. For example: When someone says sound is eternal because it is an effect like a pot, such a ground is said to be a viruddha ground. Here, the state of being an effect is indeed pervaded by non-eternity which is the absence of eternity. 



Notes: 47 



It is not true that wherever there is 'effectness' there is 'eternity'. On the contrary, it is only true that wherever there is 'effectness' there is non-eternity. In this way, the ground given in the argument is pervaded by just opposite of what was intended to be proved on the basis of the ground of 'effectness'. 



nityatva 



kāryatva 



sabda 



sādhyābhāva, here is nityatvābhāva and this pervades kāryatva. Hence this hetu is called viruddha. 



Over and above the vyabhicara-dosa this hetu (kāryatva) is suffering here from the defect of virodha also.

Translation: 48 



A satpratipaksa kind of fallacious ground is that which has a parallel and balancing counter argument which can establish in fact the absence of probandum e.g. when the Mīmāṁsaka says 'sound is eternal because it is audible like soundness' the Naiyāyika will say sound is non-eternal because it is an effect like a pot.

sati sadhanavyāpakatvād ārdrendhanasamyoga upadhih. sopādhikatvadvahnimattvaṁ vyāpyatvāsiddham. 



Translation: 49 



Asiddha is of three kinds: (i) āśrayāsiddha (ii) svarūpā- siddha and (iii) vyāpyatvāsiddha. The example for aśrayāsiddha is the sky lotus is fragrant because it is a lotus, like a lotus in the pond.' Here, the sky lotus is the locus of fragrance but that does not exist. The example for svarupāsiddha will be 'sound is a quality because it can be grasped by eyes.' 



Here, it is obvious that sound cannot be grasped by eyes, because sound can be grasped only by ears. Vyapyatvāsiddha is that which is associated with some extraneous factor (upadhi). An upadhi is defined as 'that which pervades the probandum but does not pervade the probans.' The pervasion of probandum means not being the counter-positive of an absence which is collocated with the probandum and being not the pervader of the probans means the state of being the counter-positive of an absence which exists in the locus of probans. 



To illustrate: In the case of inference viz. the mountain has smoke because it has fire, the contact with wet fuel is considered to be an upadhi. It can be seen that wherever there is smoke there is contact with wet fuel and hence the contact with the wet fuel pervades the smoke, but, it is not true that wherever there is fire there is contact with the wet fuel. For instance, in a red hot iron ball, there is no contact with wet fuel and still there is fire. Thus, the contact with 



[[88]]



English Translation with Notes 



wet fuel which is the pervader of the probandum viz. smoke in the present case and non-pervader of the probans viz. fire in the present case becomes upadhi. Naturally, the ground fire will be declared as vyāpyatvāsiddha because it is associated with an upadhi. 



Notes: 49 



Inference does not work 'if any component of the process of inference is not established or known. Inference has three main components: (i) pakṣa where sadhya is intended to be established; (ii) hetu by the knowledge of which the process of initiated and (iii) the relationship (vyāpti) the knowledge of which takes one to the knowledge of sadhya. All these three are required to be known. 



vyāpti 



hetu 



sādhya 



pakṣa 



All these three must be known to initiate and complete the process of inference. If pakṣa is not known it results into pakṣāsiddhi or aśrayāsiddhi; if hetu is not known it will result into svarupāsiddhi, and if vyāpti is not known it will lead to vyapyatvāsiddhi. 



89Tarkasangraha of Annambhatta 



Upadhi means an extraneous factor. When the colours of the flower is reflected in the crystal, the colour is treated as upādhi. The colour is not the intrinsic property of the crystal. In the same way, the vyāpti in the contact with the wet fuel (ardrendhana-samyoga) appears in the fire qualified by the contact with the wet fuel in the inference of smoke on the ground of fire and that is why the contact with the wet fuel is treated as upādhi. This diagnosis explains why one does not get the knowledge of vyāpti in cases like 'There is smoke, because there is fire.' 



The possibility of such a case is when the vyapti is viṣama-vyāpti where the area of sadhya or vyāpaka is wider than the area of hetu. To put it diagrammatically:

The contradicted ground is that which leads to the establishment of absence of probandum through some other process of knowing. For example, if someone says that fire is not hot because it is an entity, here, "not hot" is the probandum and its absence will be "hot" which can be verified by our sense organ of touch. This explains the process of inference.

The contradiction is proved by another process of knowing. If one claims that fire is cold, on some ground, its opposite 



is proved by perception.

Upamāna or analogical process is that through which an analogical cognition is produced. An analogical cognition is a cognition of the relationship between a name and the named. i.e. word and its meaning. The instrument of that is the knowledge of similarity. 



To explain, suppose someone does not know the meaning of the word gavaya and goes to the forest and asks the forester the meaning of it, the forester says that gavaya is similar to cow. Having heard this, he again goes to the forest and sees an animal similar to cow and immediately remembers the sentence of the forester. After that, an analogical cognition arises such as this (animal) is the referent of the word gavaya. This is how the process of upamāna is explained. 



Notes: 51 



Naiyāyikas need this process to know the relationship between a word and its meaning which is not known by any other process. Udayana mentions upamāna as a means of knowing the samjñā-samjñi-sambandha in the following 



verse:

Śabda (source of our verbal understanding) is a sentence of a reliable person. A reliable person is one who speaks the truth or fact. 



A sentence is defined as: 'a collection of words or

Notes: 52 



Śabda does not mean 'word' here. It stands for sentence of 



a reliable person who wants to share his or her knowledge. One who knows the fact and wants to share the knowledge 



of the fact is an apta. 



Sentence also is defined semantically. That linguistic string of morphemes which satisfies three conditions namely, mutual expectancy, compatability and proximity, which are going to be discussed in Text No. 54. 



There are two traditions of defining: defining formally and defining semantically. 



The Paninian tradition defines formally and Nyaya tradition defines semantically. According to the tradition of Pāņini a sentence is that expression unit which contains one finite verbal form (ekatin vākyam- Kātyāyana).

A morpheme is a minimum meaningful unit of a language i.e. it has a relationship with its referent. The relationship is the desire of God which has the form "Let this meaning be understood from this morpheme." 



Notes: 53 



Pada means a minimum meaningful unit of a sentence i.e. a morpheme if we talk in terms of modern linguistics. 



Pāṇini defines pada as a finished form (subanta or tinanta) which is a formal definition. 



But Naiyāyikas define pada semantically as 'that which is related to its meaning (śakta)? Śakta means 'that which possesses śakti. Śakti means a primary relationship between a morpheme and its referent. Vrtti is the term which refers to both, the primary relationship (śakti) and the secondary or extended relationship called lakṣaṇa. 



According to this system the creator of universe and the language is God. Hence His desire stands for the primary relationship initially. But in course of time the term śakti meant any 'desire' giving room for coinage of words by human beings also. All technical terms, proper names etc. get explained in this way.

Translation: 54 



The causes of verbal understanding are mutual expe- ctancy, compatability and proximity. The expectancy is the state of not generating, by one morpheme, the understanding of relationship prompted by the absence of another morpheme. The compatability means absurdity of relating two meanings. Proximity means utterance of morphemes one after the other without a gap more than necessary. A sentence which does not have these factors like expectancy etc. is not a valid sentence. For instance, the collection of words like cow, horse, man, elephant, is not a valid sentence because these morphemes do not 



[[95]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



have any mutual expectancy. The sentence "one sprinkles fire" is also not a valid sentence because it does not have compatibility. If someone utters a sentence like "bring a cow" the first word in the morning and the second one in the afternoon, such a sentence will not be a valid sentence, because there is no proximity here. 



Notes: 54 



Human beings speak language. When he or she speaks, he or she performs a speech act. Every speech act of a normal human being is intentional. Therefore, when he or she speaks, he or she sends an invitation to the listener or the reader to visit the world of the speaker. 



A sentence is an encoded cognition of his or her world. The hearer or reader is expected to decode that sentence and visit the world of the speaker which formed the object of the knowledge of the speaker which he or she encoded. When this happens we say that there is rapport (samvada) between the speaker and the listener and when this does not happen we say that there is failure of communication (visaṁvāda). Keeping this situation of use of language in view, the Naiyayikas have defined the semantic concepts such as ākānkṣā, yogyatā and sannidhi. In the absence of any of these factors, a sentence fails to be the medium of successful communication.

Translation: 55 



A sentence is of two types, a Vedic sentence and an ordinary sentence. All the Vedic sentences are valid source of verbal understanding because they are uttered by God. But, only that ordinary sentence which is uttered by a reliable person can be treated as a valid source of verbal understanding. Other sentences are not valid. 



Notes: 55 



Language is classified into two categories: language of scripture like the language of the Vedas and ordinary language that we speak. The first category involves faith in a culture and the second category is any language that human beings speak. Faith and respect in a culture prompts its defense and urge for its continuity. To add rationality to it requires broader generalization. Exactly this is what has happened here. It is absolutely rational to say that a sentence is dependable if and only if it is a sentence of a reliable person, and not a sentence of a cheat or of one who wants to mislead. An ordinary sentence of an ordinary human being is possible to be of both the types: reliable and non-reliable. But how can such possibility be allowed about a sentence which is culturally respected? That is why, a speaker like God who knows the truth and is compassionate to share the truth and is kind enough to show the right path of self-realization to humanity is 



[[97]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



brought into the frame-work of rationality. Vedic culture is valuable and hence it must continue. But basically, the Vedic culture was a text-bound culture. 



Therefore, unless the authenticity is attributed to the Vedic text, how can this culture maintain its continuity? It is this reason that prompted the Nyaya system to ascribe authenticity to the Vedic texts by saying that the Vedas are uttered by God. Since by definition God is all-knowing and all-compassionate and since such a God created the Vedic texts, Vedas must be treated as authentic. 



The sentence of the human beings, however, can be both, authentic and non-authentic. But only those sentences are authentic and dependable which are the sentences of a trust-worthy person. 



## 56 



वाक्यार्थज्ञानं शाब्दज्ञानम्। तत्करणं शब्दः॥ 



vākyārthajñānam śābdajñānam. tatkaranam sabdaḥ. 



Translation: 56 



The understanding that is caused by the knowledge of the sentence meaning is called verbal understanding. The instrument of such a cognition is called śabda or a sentence. 



Notes: 56 



The understanding which arises from an authentic sentence is called verbal understanding and such a sentence is called verbal testimony (śabda-pramāņa). In other words, an authentic sentence encodes a true cognition and 



[[98]]



English Translation with Notes 



an unauthentic sentence encodes a false cognition. That is why, after decoding the authentic sentence one arrives at the valid understanding and after decoding the inauthentic sentence one arrives at an invalid or false understanding.

Notes: 57 



Thus, the entire world can be known by four ways of knowing (pramāņa), namely, the direct process of internalizing, the process of inferring, the peculiar process of knowing the word-meaning-relationship and the process of verbal understanding, and the results of these four processes of knowing are perceptual, inferential, analogical, and verbal cognition or understanding.

Translation: 58 



A false cognition is of three types: (i) doubt (ii) error and (iii) hypothetical assumption. A doubt is that cognition which reflects mutually contradicted properties residing in one locus. E.g. the doubt whether it is a post or it is a man. An erroneous cognition is a false cognition. For instance, when looking at a conch shell someone says 'this is silver. An hypothetical assumption is that in which one assumes or imagines a pervader by assuming or imagining the pervaded. For example, when someone says: 'had there not been fire there would not have been smoke? 



Notes: 58 



Doubt, erroneous cognition and cognition of imagined or constructed world are the three types of false cognitions. When two contradictory properties appear to share one and the same locus, it becomes a case of doubt: 



sthāṇutva 



puruṣatva 



? 



= Doubt whether it is a post or a man. 



When the property is seen occurring in a locus whereas in fact, there is absence of that property it becomes a 



[[100]]



English Translation with Notes 



case of error or mistake. It does not happen willfully, it simply happens due to a number of factors (either in the object of perception, or distance, or defects in the senses, or disturbance in the mind and so on): 



rajatatva 



absence of rajatatva 



śakti 



(This is silver): Error 



In the third type of false cognition the cognizer knows that he has imagined an event or situation, which is not present outside at that moment of time. This is an imagination of a possibility, of course, which matches the fact, experienced before. This is not absurd, but this can be verified. That is why, it can be used to confirm the invariable relationship of the probans (hetu) with the probandum (sādhya). This is why, tarka has been counted in the list of false cognitions.

Translation: 59 



A remembrance is also of two types: (i) true and (ii) false. A true remembrance is that which is caused by true cognition. A false remembrance is that which is caused by false cognition. 



Notes: 59 



As experience can be of two types: true or false, so also remembrance can be true or false. A true remembrance is produced by the impressions provided by true experience and a false remembrance is produced by the impressions produced by false impressions.

सर्वेषामनुकूलतया वेदनीयं सुखम्॥ 



sarveṣāmanukūlatayā vedaniyaṁ sukham. 



Translation: 60 



Happiness is that quality of the self which everybody wants to have. 



Notes: 60 



The feeling, a human being wants to have again and again, is pleasure. The knowledge or experience of something produces pleasure. Knowledge itself is not pleasure, as the Buddhists think. We have knowledge of pleasure and so knowledge is different from pleasure. We also have desire of pleasure and therefore desire is not pleasure. Pleasure is always a product and hence it can never be permanent. 



[[102]]



English Translation with Notes 



That is why; external pleasure is not postulated as the parama-puruṣārtha by the Nyaya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. According to them, absolute 'cessation of pain' is the ultimate goal of human life. Since existence of permanent pleasure is not possible, it cannot be postulated as the ultimate goal. The cause of sukha is also called pleasure secondarily, as ghee which is the source of healthy life is also called 'life' (ayurvai ghṛtam). 



## 61 



प्रतिकूलतया वेदनीयं दुःखम् ॥ 



pratikulataya vedaniyam duḥkham. 



Translation: 61 



Unhappiness is that which nobody wants. 



Notes: 61 



What one and all normal human beings do not want to have is the feeling of pain. Nobody wants pain. It is not the case that one does not want pain for only some time, rather he or she does not want pain for ever. But the fact is this that every pleasure is terminated in pain, because the pleasure is momentary. Wherever there is pleasure, there is pain. It is true that human beings want pleasurable feeling, but since it is not possible to be in that state always, and since every pleasurable state is converted into pain, the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers argued in favor of 'absolute cessation of pain' as the ultimate goal of life. 



The source of duḥkha is also called pain secondarily.

इच्छा कामः॥

Desire is kāma. 



Notes: 62 



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



Desire is want. Obviously, what is known can only be desired. Thus, the desire is preceded by knowledge. Knowledge presents x before us and if we are in need of it we want to have x. 



X 



X 



knowledge of x 



desire of x 



Thus, knowledge produces 'desire'.

कृतिः प्रयत्नः॥ 



krtiḥ prayatnaḥ. 



Translation: 64 



Volition is internal effort. 



Notes: 64 



Volition means mental preparedness. After knowledge presents x, there arises the desire of x and thereafter there occurs mental preparation to take up an external activity (ceṣṭā) to obtain x. 



X 



X 



X

It should be noted that the object of knowledge is the object of desire and also of volition. It cannot be the case that x is known and y is desired and the mental readiness arises with regard to z. 



All these three are mental states. What is visible after the volition is called ceṣṭā or external physical activity.

Translation: 65 



Dharma is that which is produced by sanctioned act. 



Notes: 65 



Dharma stands for the result of a moral act or duty. It is the merit left behind by an act which is sanctioned by the society or social history, which includes Vedic injunctions, which aim at bestowing human good. 



It is the result of a moral act in the sense that it is an outcome of an act of duty. In terms of this dharma next birth is explained. It is also called punya (merit).

Adharma is that which is produced by a prohibited act. 



Notes: 66 



Adharma is opposite of dharma (demerit). A bad act produces adharma which is held responsible for miserable life after death. It is also called pāpa. 



The cycle of birth and death is explained in terms dharma and adharma. Both are collectively called adrsta. It is postulated as a causal link (apūrva) between the performance of an act and the result that a good or bad act is expected to produce.

Translation: 67 



There are eight special qualities beginning from cognition which are situated only in the Self. Cognition, desire and volition can be eternal and non-eternal. They are eternal in God and non-eternal in an individual Self. 



Notes: 67 



Individual's inner world consists of knowledge, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, volition, merit, demerit and impressions. These are the qualities of the spiritual substance, called self. These do not reside in any other substance. These are special qualities of the self. All human beings are given with this inner world. My inner world is different from your inner world in the sense that I alone can be aware of my inner world and not the inner world of others. I can, however, infer others' inner worlds. Others' inner worlds are external to me, and similarly, my inner world is external to others. Knowledge, desire and volition of God have to be eternal, otherwise the creation cannot be explained rationally. If this knowledge etc. also are treated as non-eternal, He will not be different from any human being and in that case He cannot create the universe.

Translation: 68 



Impression is of three kinds: (i) velocity, (ii) impressions left behind by experience and (iii) elasticity. Velocity is found in five substances viz. earth, water, fire, air and mind. Impression produced by experience is the cause of remembrance. It exists only in the self. Elasticity is that quality which brings back a substance to its original form when that substance assumes another form. It is found only in materials like mat etc. made of earth. 



Notes: 68 



The first non-material cause of the first moment of falling of a fruit from the tree is weight (gravity) and the non-material cause of the second moment of falling onwards is the velocity. 



Remembrance is caused by impressions alone which are produced by experiences. These impressions also exist only in the self and hence they are the members of our inner world. Elasticity is the peculiar quality of the earth only.

Action is any movement. The action of throwing up is the cause of the contact of the substance with the upper region. Throwing down is the cause of contact with the lower region. The action of shrinking is the cause of contact with the region nearer one's body. The action of spreading is the cause of contact with the region away from the body. All other actions are mere movement. 



Notes: 69 



As a matter of fact action is movement of any type. Five varieties are stated only to illustrate this aspect.

109Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



Translation: 70 



Universal is one, eternal and present in all particulars. That is of two kinds: para (highest universal) and apara (lower universal). Highest universal is being (sattā). The lower universals are substanceness etc. 



Notes: 70 



Universal is a class-forming property. Through this the members of a class is brought under one group. By 'potness' all pots are brought under one class. 



The universal is one and through this the individuals are named by a single name. Thus, through potness (i.e. the ground for the application of the term 'pot') all pots are called by one and the same name. A particular shape (ākṛti) reveals a particular universal (jāti). 



Depending on the area it occupies, a universal can be para or apara. Para means wider and apara means smaller in area of existence. It can be illustrated as follows: 



pṛthivitva 



In a pot all the three are present: 



[[110]]



dravyatva 



ghaṭatva 



English Translation with Notes 



dravyatva 



pṛthivitva 



ghaṭatva 



ghata 



But these three properties or universals are related by the relationship of pervader and pervaded. Dravyatva is pervader of the other two, but is not pervaded by any of the other two. But pṛthivītva is pervader of ghaṭatva and is pervaded by dravyatva. Similarly, ghaṭatva is only pervaded by the other two and is not pervader of the either of the two. This is how they are related.

Particulars (viseṣa) are existent in permanent substances and they distinguish each one from the other. 



Notes: 71 



The discreteness of all permanent substances is obtained by introducing this concept of viseṣa. All the atomic states of earth, water, fire and air, sky, time, space, all individual souls, and mind are distinct from one another on account of the visesa. There are so many viseṣas as many permanent substances. The viśeṣa-s, however, are distinct by themselves.

Translation: 72 



Inherence is a permanent relationship. It is found in two inseparable entities. Two entities are said to be inseparable when one depends on the other unless one of them is destroyed. 



For example, there is inherence between a part and a whole, between quality and substance, between action and substance, between universal and particular and between particular (viseṣa) and permanent substance. 



Notes: 72 



Relation as an entity or objective reality is accepted in this system on the basis of qualified knowledge. A qualified knowledge is caused by this entity. 



Without a relationship there cannot arise any qualified knowledge (visiṣṭa-jñāna). Every qualified cognition, therefore, reflects three things in a structured form: (a) qualifier (viseṣaṇa), relation (sambanda) and qualificand (viśeşya):

Translation: 73 



Pre-absence has no beginning but an end. For instance, there is pre-absence of an effect before it comes into being. 



114English Translation with Notes 



Notes: 73 



The pre-absence of an effect exists in the materials out of which the effect is going to be produced and it comes to an end after the effect comes into being. It has no beginning but has an end. The pre-absence is considered to be a cause of the effect. 



The system of Nyaya-Vaiśeṣika does not accept satkāryavāda, according to which the effect is accepted to be present in its cause. Instead, there is pre-absence of the effect in the cause-hold the Naiyāyikas. This is the reason that they define an effect (karya) as the counter positive of a pre-absence. For the satkāryavādins utpatti means abhivyakti (manifestation), whereas for the ārambhavādins (i.e. the Naiyāyikas), utpatti means 'coming into being which was not there.'

There are three states: (a) the pre-absence of an effect (say, pot) in its cause (i.e. kapālas), (b) then the effect (pot) comes into being and (c) when the pot gets destroyed the destruction of the effect (pot) comes into being. The 



[[115]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



destruction has beginning but has no end. Whatever is a product is likely to be destroyed. This generalization is valid for positive entities only. Because, the destruction has a beginning i.e. it is produced, but has no end. Pre-absence has no beginning but it comes to an end.

Translation: 75 



An absolute absence is a relational absence in all the three times, past, present and future. For example, when we say there is no pot on the ground. 



Notes: 75 



In this universe x exists in x by the relation of identity (tādātmya or abheda) and can exist elsewhere by the relation of difference (bheda). The relations of difference may be contact, inherence and self-linking (svarūpa). A pot exists on the ground by contact relation: 



pot 



ground 



contact 



But pot exists in its parts by the relation of inherence: 



[[116]]



English Translation with Notes 



pot 



inherence 



parts of pot 



An absence of pot exists on the ground by the self-linking 



relation: 



absence of pot 



ground 



inherence 



Because of the above fact, a pot does not exist on any ground by inherence. Not only that, pot does not exist on the same ground, where it exists by contact, by the relation of inherence. 



Such absences are called absolute absence. 



The term absolute absence does not refer to absence of sky-flower because sky-flower does not exist anywhere at all. Absence of only that is possible, which exists somewhere by some relationship. 



Therefore, the sentence 'There is no sky-flower' is an empty sentence according to this system. 



The absence of pot on the ground by contact is a fact which is true at all times, past, present and future. As a matter of fact, it also exists in the place where pot exists. 



[[117]]



Tarkasangraha of Annambhaṭṭa 



But its presence does not allow its knowledge to occur because its counter-positive is present there. 



Some philosophers like the Prabhakaras think that the absence of pot on ground is produced when the pot is removed from that ground and when the pot is brought back to that ground that absence gets destroyed. But this theory is not acceptable to the Nyaya-Vaiśeṣikas. 



The reference 'there is no pot on this ground by contact' is valid in all the three times, present, past, and future. 



As a matter of fact, this absence refers to an absence of the denial of the relation of difference (bheda- sambandha).

A mutual absence is that absence which describes the counter-positiveness which is delimited by the relation of identity. For example, the pot is not cloth. 



Notes: 76 



Because x is identical with x and different from all that is not x, we say 'x is not y'. It means 'x is identical with x', 'y is identical with y' and so 'x is not y'. This is a case of denial of the relation of identity.

सर्वेषामपि पदार्थानां यथायथमुक्तेष्वेवान्तर्भावात्सप्तैव पदार्था इति सिद्धम्॥ sarveṣāmapi padārthānām yathāyathamukteṣvevāntarbhāvāt saptaiva padarthā iti siddham. 



Translation: 77 



Since all entities (referents) can be included in the list of seven stated in the beginning, there are only seven types of entities which constitute the whole of our universe. This is how it has been established.

Gautama Nyayasūtra 1.1.1 mentions sixteen padarthas namely: process of knowing (pramāņa), object of knowledge (prameya), 



(prameya), doubt (samsaya), purpose (prayojana), example (dṛṣṭānta), doctrine (siddhānta), member of syllogistic argument (avayava), imagined fact (tarka), conclusion (nirṇaya), discourse to arrive at the truth (vāda), disputation (jalpa), negative attitude of

finding fault with a view without providing an alternative solution (vitanda), bad ground for inference (hetvābhāsa), twisting argument (cala), wrong answer (jāti) and points or ground for defeat (nigrahasthāna). 



These padarthas are directly or indirectly helping factors in the process of inference. However, all of them are entities and therefore, these can be included in the already accepted seven sets of entities forwarded by the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika system. 



Thus, categorically the whole universe is put into seven categories of entities is an adequate and exhaustive classification.
