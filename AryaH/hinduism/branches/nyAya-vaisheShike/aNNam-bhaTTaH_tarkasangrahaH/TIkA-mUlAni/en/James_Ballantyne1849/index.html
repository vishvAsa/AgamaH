<p>PREFACE.</p>
<p>THESE lectures were delivered to the senior class of pupils</p>
<p>in the English Department of the Benares College, with the</p>
<p>vicw of introducing them to the philosophical terminology</p>
<p>current among their learned fellow-countrymen the pandits.</p>
<p>The easiest, if not the only, way to obtain a thorough ac- quaintance with the force of the terms belonging to a philo-</p>
<p>sophical system, is to study the system itself. The circum-</p>
<p>stances under which the lectures were delivered will account</p>
<p>for their familiar tone, and for the introduction of various</p>
<p>remarks which would have been superfluous if the work had</p>
<p>been addressed to the Icarned of Europe.</p>

<p>LECTURES</p>
<p>ON THE</p>
<p>NYAYA PHILOSOPHY.</p>
<p>THE compendium of the Nyáya system of philosophy, entitled the Tarka-Sangraha, which we propose here to translate and comment upon, has the following exordium :&ndash;</p>
<p>निधाय हृदि विश्वेशं विधाय गुरुवन्दनं ।</p>
<p>arenai yoârua fauå nådde: 1</p>
<p>World</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having treasured in my heart the Lord of the Universe, and having saluted (my) preceptor, (this) Compendium of the Dialectical Philosophy is made by me)for the purpose of plea- santly instructing those who are unacquainted (with the sub- ject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author then proceeds to enumerate the categories or most general heads under one or other of which every name current in the world is capable of being classed. These in accordance with the system of Kanáda, followed by the au- thor of the Tarka-sangraha, are enumerated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>द्रव्यगुणक सामान्यविशेषसमवायाभावात पदार्थः ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Substance (dravya), Quality (guna), Action (karmma), Community of properties (sámánya), Difference (visesha), In- timate Relation (samaváya), and Non-existence (abháva), are the seven categories (padártha).”</p>

<p>LECTURES ON THE</p>
<p>The word Category is derived from a Greek word corres- ponding to the Latin predicamentum, and signifying “what can be said or predicated&rdquo; respecting the several things in- cluded under the term. For example, the Weight, Ductility, and Malleability of gold are qualities. We predicate or as- sert that Ductility comes under the category or predicament of quality—and so of the others. And again we say that gold comes under the category of substance. But we cannot, cor- rectly speaking, predicate any thing of Quality itself, except that it is one of the most general or comprehensive of Names. From its etymology it would seem that the word padártha is equivalent to padasya artha, “the meaning of a word”—and the meaning of every common term must be comprised un- der one or other of the Categories that constitute a correct division of Names.</p>
<p>Different schools of philosophy have adopted different sets of categories. Those of Aristotle were “substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, condition, possession, action, and passion.&rdquo; Those of Zoroaster were the principles of &ldquo;sensa- tion, intelligence, judgment, conscience, and life.&rdquo; Those of Locke were &ldquo;extension, solidity, mobility, perceptivity, moti- vity, existence, duration, and number.”</p>
<p>Our text book now proceeds to enumerate the sub-divisions of the Categories:-</p>
<p>तच द्रव्याणि ष्टथिव्यप्तेजो वाय्वाकाशकालदिगाममनांसि नवैव ।</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;There (in the enumeration of Categories) what are meant by substances are these nine-earth (prithiví), water (að), light (tejas), air (váyu), ether (úkásá1), time (kála), space (dig), soul (átman), and mind (manas).”</p>
<p>Modern Chemistry has resolved water into two gases, one of which is a constituent also of the compound air that we breathe. Earth is a very vague term, on which we shall have to remark further on. Philosophers are still divided in opi-</p>
<p>An &ldquo;Substance depend the 6 categories that follow it.</p>

<p>nion as to whether light is an imponderable substance or the effect of undulation. The term Ether seems to be frequently employed in a sense scarcely differing from that of space in three dimensions. The specific quality assigned to it in the Nyáya system will be considered further on. Time and Space are here classed as substances, because the word substance is em- ployed to signify that to which qualities can be attributed. The reason for viewing soul and mind as different substances will appear in the sequel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Earth is distinguished by the quality of smell. It is of two kinds-eternal, and transient. It is eternal in the form of atoms; transient in the form of aggregates or products.”</p>
<p>In order to come to a right understanding with the suppor- ters of the view here laid down, it is necessary in the first place to enquire whether the first proposition is intended as a defi- nition or as a dogma. If as a definition of the sense in which the Nyáya philosopher intends to employ the term “earth,” then it must be conceded that, as the propounder of any the- ory has a right to define his terms as he pleases, provided he keeps strictly to his definition throughout the argument, and does not attempt to apply, in any different sense of the term, the conclusions thus obtained, the Nyaya philosopher is, on this understanding, fully entitled to call every thing earth that smells, and nothing earth that does not smell. The question then remaining will be, whether the division of ob- jects into odorous and inodorous is of any service in rendering our acquired knowledge more distinct, or in facilitating the acquirement of fresh knowledge. Let us see how the case stands. Ammoniacal gas, composed of the two simple and inodorous gases Hydrogen and Nitrogen, is powerfully odorous. Will it facilitate or obstruct our acquaintance with the cha- racter and the relations of this substance, if we separate it from the class of airs, and associate it with stones and gems or flowers? History must answer this question-the history of the progress of chemical discovery under the elemental the- ory and that of inductive analysis.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the proposition that &ldquo;Earth is distin- guished by the quality of smell&rdquo; is intended not as a defini-6</p>
<p>LECTURES ON THE</p>
<p>tion of the sense in which the term earth is to be employed throughout the argument, but as an assertion that there ac- tually is one real and distinct principle which is the constitu- ent equally of every thing that is odorous, then the philoso- phy of modern Europe demurs to the proposition. It is not self-evidently true. If it be true, therefore, it must be shown to be so by the adduction of evidence, or of sufficient autho- rity. What evidence can be adduced in support of the propo- sition, we may learn further on. What constitutes suitable authority will also form a question for enquiry in the sequel.</p>
<p>The transitoriness of earth in the form of aggregates sig- nifies the want of permanence in the forms, such as jars, &amp;c., which it may assume. The jar, when crushed to powder, is no longer a jar, but the earth of which it is composed, still remains.</p>
<p>The existence of eternal atoms has been a favourite specu- lation in several schools of philosophy. Among the Grecks, Epicurus is one of the most celebrated of the supporters of the atomic theory. The doctrine has been revived by some modern chemists, not as an ascertained fact, but as a hypo- thesis which furnishes terms very convenient in enunciating the chemical laws of Definite Proportions.</p>
<p>Our text-book proceeds to subdivide the products of earth as follows</p>

<p>To say that an organ of sense is earthy, or watcry, or etheri- al, would seem to indicate some confusion of thought as to the boundary line between mind and matter. But the Nyáya philosophers have perhaps been led to adopt this fanciful view of the senses rather by their excessive fondness for system, which was gratified by the simple means thus afforded of stow- ing away cach of the senses in an ostensibly appropriate place. This point can be more satisfactorily enquired into when we have heard the account given of the other senses.</p>

Had the same view been taken of cold and heat, water would have escaped being defined, as it is herc, by a characteristic which the Naiyáyika would scarcely recognize if he dipped his finger into a boiling tea kettle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light is distinguished by being hot to the feel. It is of two kinds eternal in the form of atoms; transient in the form of products. These products again are of three kinds, through the division of organized body, organ of sense, and unorganic mass. Luminous organized bodics abide in the so- lar realm, as every one knows; the lucid organ of sense is sight (chakshus) the recipient of colour, residing in the fore- part of the black pupil of the eye; unorganic light is of four kinds, according to the division of earthy (bhauma), celestial a (divya), intestinal (audarya), and mineral (ákdrają). Earthy</p>

<p>&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Nyaya regards light and heat as one and the same substance. Modern research has discovered striking analogies not only between light and heat but also between these and electricity and magnetism; but whether they are radically the same or different has not yet been determined by investigation. In the Nyaya the organ of sight is said to be a ray of light proceeding from the pupil of the eye towards the object view- ed. The Bauddhas affirm that the organ of sight is the pupil of the eye itself. Modern optical science pronounces that we see</p>

<p>The doctrine of intestinal heat seems like an anticipation of of Liebig&rsquo;s theory of digestion; but, like some other seeming anticipations of scientific discovery, it reverses the order of cause and effect. The animal heat arises from the digestion of the food; the body acting, as Liebig tells us, &ldquo;as a furnace which we supply with fuel.”</p>
<p>Gold is supposed by the Naiyáyikas not to be earthy like the other metals, because the strongest heat of a furnace is insufficient to calcine it, or turn it into an earthy looking oxide.</p>
<p>In the Mimánsa, gold is reckoned a distinct substance, as it is by European chemists,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Air is colourless, and sensible to the feel. It is of two sorts, eternal and transient :-eternal in the form of atoms- transient in the form of aggregates. These aggregates again are of three kinds through the division of organized body, organ of sense, and unorganic mass. Aerial organized bodies belong to the realm of air (evil spirits, such as the pisáchas); the ae- rial organ, the percipient of touch, is the aerial cuticle (twak), ch pervading the whole body. Inorganic masses of air are such as cause the shaking of trees and the like.&rdquo;</p>

When we go to a great height, in a balloon or on a mountain, the diminution in the amount of the blue rays refracted, owing to the smallness of the mass of air above us, causes the sky to appear nearly black-black being the absence of all colour.</p>

<p>“Air circulating within the body is vital air ( prána); and this, though single, takes the name of breathing, flatulence, &amp;c., through the distinction of modifying circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this opinion Professor Wilson (p. 104 of his edition of the Sánkhya káriká) remarks, &ldquo;The vital airs are, in fact, the vital functions of breathing, circulation, and digestion. That these functions, resulting from organization, should be sup- posed to partake of the nature of aerial humours, originates very possibly from some misapprehension of the phænomena of breathing, flatulence, and arterial pulsation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ether is the substratum of the quality of sound. It is one, all-pervading, and eternal.”</p>
<p>This element is inferred in order to account for sound. As sound can be conveyed through solids, liquids, and air—but not through a vacuum, it appears to be an imaginary ele- ment, devised with the view of providing each of the senses with a separate element. As pure air and water are devoid of odour, it seems to have been decided by the Naiyáyikas that odour is the distinctive evidence of earth :-the percep- tion of savour being dependent on the presence of moisture in the mouth, it was decided that the sense of taste must be aqueous in its nature :—the relation between light and vision</p>

<p>was obvious :&ndash;and the air having been appropriated to the sense of touch, which envelopes the whole body just as the air usually envelopes it, there remained nothing for it, if the uniformity of the system was to be established, but to postu- late a fifth elementary essence to account for hearing; and this received the name of ether. A fifth element, under the name of Quintessence, was imagined by some ancient philoso- phers of Europe, but with a different view from that of the Nyáya system.</p>
<p>The opinion that the senses must resemble in their nature the objects which they were to apprehend is akin to the opini- on long prevalent in Europe that a cause must resemble its effect. It is in some respects the converse of the theory of ideas or sensible forms. In that theory outward bodies were supposed to send refined copies of themselves to the mind through the senses. Here, on the other hand, the mind is viewed as despatching a sense towards its object in a material state resembling that of the object itself. Thus luminous bo- dies are represented as being discerned by means of a ray of light which proceeds from the eye, and which constitutes the sense of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The seat of knowledge is the soul (átman). It is two-fold the living soul, and the Supreme soul. The Supreme Soul (or Spirit), the Lord, the Omniscient, is One only subject to neither pleasure nor pain. Living soul is distributed, one to each human body. It is infinite and eternal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reason assigned for saying that the human soul is infi- nite is this, that whithersoever the body goes, there the soul too is present.</p>

<p>«Mind (manas) is the instrument which effects the appre- hension of pleasure, pain, &amp;c. It is innumerable, through there being one assigned to each soul. It is in the form of an atom, and is eternal.”</p>
<p>The Naiyáyikas argue that the mind is minutely small, as an atom, because if it were infinite, as the Mímánsa maintains, it might be united with every thing at once, and all sensations might be contemporaneous. Various sensations, the Naiyáyikas contend, do not arise at one time to the same soul. &ldquo;They on- ly seem to do so when passing rapidly, though successively; as a firebrand, whirled with velocity, seems a ring of fire.”—The phenomenon here instanced is accounted for in modern philo- sophy by the statement that the retina retains impressions for a short time after the exciting cause has been removed. Ana- logously the ear apprehends one continuous sound when the succession of sounds is very rapid, as when a slip of wood is successively struck by the teeth of a rapidly revolving wheel.</p>

<p>Lestas</p>
<p>The researches of sir Isaac Newton have established the fact that colour belongs to light only, and that a ray of white light contains all the primary colours, which can be separated by a prism of glass. An object appears of the colour of the ray which it reflects; and the different power in different bodies to absorb one portion of a white ray and to reflect the colour- ed residue of the ray, gives rise to the variety of colours visi- ble in nature.</p>

<p>It would be more in accordance with the usage of modern language, to say that pure water is devoid of savour, although moisture is indispensable to the perception of the savour resi- ding in other matters. The term sweetness more properly suggests the taste of sugar and the like.</p>

<p>On the opinion that odour is peculiar to earth we have al- ready remarked.

The odour of musk is fragrance to one man, and stench in the nostrils of another.</p>

<p>The feeling here described is that of temperature only; and it is perhaps of that only that the organ gives us information without the cooperation of our muscular frame, which, by creating or offering resistance, conduces to the sensation of hardness, roughness, and the like.</p>

The as- sertion of the universal transientness of duality, &amp;c. is either X intended to conciliate the Vedántists, who deny duality alto- gether; or else it is a reflection of the mystical doctrine which these philosophers propound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cause (other than the body itself) of (a body&rsquo;s) be- ginning to fall is Gravity, which resides in earth and wa- ter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gravity is here spoken of as being confined to earth and water. If Gotama or Aristotle had been permitted to wit- ness the experiments of Torricelli and Pascal, they would have changed their opinions respecting the supposed absence of gravity in the atmosphere. One cannot help thinking sometimes with what indignation these great original thinkers and enquirers would now look upon their wilfully blinded adherents, who, instead of following out the course of enqui- ry which their teacher had indicated, sat down to dream, through centuries, over what one single man&rsquo;s labours had amassed. An intelligent schoolboy of the present day, with his modicum of the experience of past centuries, is a being who would have been welcomed as a messenger from heaven by Plato, Kanáda, and all the other enquiring spirits of anti- quity. Gold was the heaviest substance known to the an- cients; who were not acquainted with Platinum; yet, accord- ing to the Nyaya view that gold is solidified light, it ought to have no gravity. This difficulty is met by saying that some earth is combined with light in the process of solidification; but the puzzle remains, how, with only a portion of gravita- ting matter, gold should be heavier than every other substance with which the Naiyáyikas were acquainted.</p>
<p>A noticeable decision of the Naiyáyikas was this, that le- vity is not a distinct quality, but the negation of gravity. Light and heavy are, in truth, relative terms. Stone is light in comparison with iron, but heavy in comparison with wood. The lightness here consists not in the absolute negation of gravity, but in the absence of so much as would have made the two equally heavy.</p>

<p>Fluidity is the cause, other than the fluid itself, of com- mencing to trickle. It affects earth, light, and water. It is of two sorts, natural and adscititious. It is natural (or essen- tial) in water. It is adscititious (or caused by something else) in earth and light. In earthy substance, such as butter, &amp;c., fluidity is produced by the application of fire.”</p>
<p>人</p>
<p>Modern discovery tends to establish the opinion that what Kanáda regarded as the adscititious cause of fluidity is in reality the indispensable cause of it. In the opinion of the Naiyúyi- kas &ldquo;fluidity essentially exists in hail and ice; but is obstruct- ed by an impediment arising from an unseen virtue which renders the water solid.&quot;-This unseen virtue is no other than the abstraction of heat, which also solidifies molten lead after it has been removed from the fire. The three states of solid, liquid, and aeriform, most probably belong equally to every substance-or, at least to every uncompounded substance; for heat separates many compounds. Every one who has studied the works of modern chemists will admit the probability of this view.</p>
<p>The rendering of light fluid by means of fire, alluded to in the text, has reference to the notion that gold is solidified light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In respect to a thing possessing a certain nature, a notion entertained implying that same nature is a right notion. For instance in the case of silver, the notion that this is silver&rsquo; is a right one. It is also termed pramá, that is to say, some- thing incontrovertible. Wrong notion is that which implies a nature which does not belong to the thing respecting which the notion is entertained.

<p>The merit of the Sanskrit philosophical nomenclature is observable in this passage, where we find the process of in- ference and the process of comparison cach distinguished by 3 name different from that which denotes the result of the l in</p>
<p>process, yet etymologically related to it. The term for Per-S eeption labours under the same defect as the English word the act and the result being denoted by the same ambiguous term. In our translation we have employed the plural in speaking of results, the not being of course always spoken of in the singular. Comparison and verbal authority are includ- ed, and properly in our opinion, by the followers of the Sán- khya philosophy under right affirmation.

<p>a cow, his knowledge is based on the affirmation of the per- son who stated the resemblance to him. In a strict classifi- cation, founded on a complete analysis, affirmation would not appear as an ultimate ground of knowledge or belief, for it is itself indebted to inference for all its efficacy. We believe testimony only where we have inferred that it is trustworthy. Every one is not aware of having made an inference in such a case, because it is not every one that is capable of noting and analysing the operations of his own mind, even were it to occur to him to attempt it. A young Arab believes the Ku- rán on the testimony of his father, because he has observed during his own infancy that his father is a much better in- formed person than himself, and he has always found it safer to take his father&rsquo;s word on any point than to decide in opposition to it on the strength of his own experience. He therefore infers that his father&rsquo;s word is to be trusted in regard to the Kurán also, and he infers that what he finds written in it is true, because this follows of course from the belief that his father had given a true account of the matter. Now, if, forgetting or not perceiving the real foundation of his belief, the young Arab grows up under the habitual im- pression that the Kurán is in itself an authority standing in need of no process of inference, from matters extrinsic or intrinsic, for its establishment, then he must needs remain a Musalman to the end of his days, though no one but a Musal- mán will think that his notion is a right one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cause is of three kinds according to the distinction of intimate, non-intimate, and instrumental. That from which an intimately relative effect arises in an intimate cause, as threads are of cloth, and the cloth itself of its own colour, &amp;c. Where this intimate relation exists, that cause which is as- sociated in one and the same object with such effect or cause, is non-intimate. Thus the conjunction of the threads is the non-intimate cause of the cloth, and the colour of the threads that of the colour of the cloth. The cause which is distinct from both of these is the instrumental cause, as the weaver&rsquo;s brush, the loom, &amp;c. are of cloth. Among these three kinds of causes, that only which is not a universally concurrent cause or condition (of all effects, as God, time, place, &amp;c. are) is called the instrumental canse.'</p>

<p>causes.</p>
<p>these were severally termed the material, the efficient, the formal, and the final. That out of which any thing is made, as the marble out of which a statue is made, they termed its material cause. This corresponds to the samaváyi-kárana, or intimate cause, of the text. It is the ground of the possibility of a thing&rsquo;s coming into existence. The efficient cause was that in which resides the moving power requisite in order to ren- der the possible existence actual; as the sculptor. According to the Nyáya, the sculptor would be classed along with his chissels as onc among the several nimitta-kárana or efficient The designation of karana, or instrumental cause, would belong to the chissel. The final cause of a thing, ac- cording to the Aristotelian view, is that very thing in its com- pleteness; as the statue when madc. In modern language the final cause is synonymous with the purpose to which any object is supposed to contribute; thus the promotion of vege- tion may be regarded as the final cause of rain. This corres- ponds, to what the Naiyáyikas term prayojana, motive or pur- pose. The formal cause is that which must supervene to the matter, in order to give the thing its precise individual exis- tence as that thing and no other; as the shape which the sculptor communicates to the marble. This corresponds to the asamaváyi-kárana, or non-intimate cause, of the text, in- asmuch as it is concerned about the relative distribution of the particles of which the aggregate is made up. The word &ldquo;form&rdquo; is employed in a peculiar sense by Bacon to denote that in virtue of which a given quality resides in a given &ldquo;The [Baconian] form,</p>
<p>thing; as transparency in glass. then, (vide Preliminary Dissert. Enc. Brit. p. 459), differs in nothing from the cause; only we apply the word cause where it is an event or change that is the effect. When the effect or result is a permanent quality, we speak of the form or es- sence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In modern philosophy the employment of the word causc</p>
<p>[[24]]</p>
<p>LECTURES ON THE</p>
<p>has been much simplified. We now speak of the marble as the material of the statue, not as its material cause. Again, in modern philosophy, the same view of form is taken as that taken by the Sankhyas, who say &ldquo;Cloth is not different from the threads of which it is woven, for it is made up of them;&rdquo; which, (vide Wilson&rsquo;s Sánkhya káriká, p. 38), is tantamount to Dr. Brown&rsquo;s declaration &ldquo;that the form of a body is only another name for the relative position of the parts that constitute it; and that the forms of a body are nothing but the body itself.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;final cause” is still current, but in the altered sense that we have already stated. The arguments for the existence of a Deity, drawn from the observation of nature, have reference to final causes. Harvey was led to the discovery of the circulation of the blood by en- quiring into the final cause of, or purpose to be subserved by, the valves in the blood vessels.</p>
<p>The scientific employment of the word cause in modern philosophy is founded on the familiar truth, (as stated by Mill, Logic, V. 1. p. 397), &ldquo;that invariability of succession is found by observation to obtain between every fact in nature and some other fact which has preceded it.&rdquo; Of two facts so related, that which precedes is termed the cause of the other. To prevent misconception, it is frequently termed the phy- sical cause; the word physical serving to signify that we are speaking merely of the invariable relation of succession ob- served in nature between the two facts, and not of any effi- ciency in the antecedent for the production of the consequent. That efficiency we cannot well conceive to consist in any thing else than the fact, that the relations observed in nature are such as the Author of Nature has thought fit to establish among his works. The efficiency of a cause consists in its being God&rsquo;s will that it should be efficient. This, in our opi- nion, is what is conveyed by the Musalmán expression mu- sabbib-ul-asbáb, usually rendered &ldquo;The causer of causes ;&rdquo; but</p>

<p>which, to our mind, rather expresses, &ldquo;Who maketh causes to be efficiently such,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who bestoweth on something that, in virtue of which it becomes a cause.'</p>
<p>Let us see how the chain of cause and effect, in regard to the production of cloth, looks when we resolve the variously named causes of the Nyáya into the language of invariable antecedence and succession. In such a sequence we do not enumerate the matter of the cloth, because, as the matter is the ground of the possible existence of the thing, the existence of the cloth about which we are speaking implies the existence of the matter. When we speak of an effect, we speak of an event, not of a substance; and the event of which we have to trace the chain of antecedents is the appearance of a certain amount of matter in the form of cloth. The event which in- variably precedes, and is invariably followed by, the appear- ance of cloth, is the suitable conjunction of threads. This, then, is the cause why cloth has made its appearance. That conjunction itself was immediately preceded by the operation of the loom upon the threads properly disposed. This opera- tion, which always precedes the conjunction, and which, in regard to threads suitably disposed, is invariably followed by it, is the cause of the conjunction. The operation of the loom was consequent on the muscular exertions of the weaver, which invariably precede each movement of the loom. Again, the exertions of the weaver were consequent upon his desire to possess cloth, and this desire itself was consequent upon other considerations, which we need not at present enquire further into. Thus we find that the different kinds of causes enumerated by Aristotle and the Naiyáyikas may be resolved into similar sequences, differing only in regard to the distance of each link in the chain from the ultimate effect dependent upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The relative proximity of a sense and its object, which is the cause of perception, is of six kinds, (1.) conjunction, (2.) intimate union with that which is in conjunction, (8.) intimate union with what is intimately united with that which is in conjunction, (4.) intimate union, (5.) intimate union with that which is intimately united, and (6.) the connection which arises from the relation between that which qualifies and the thing qualified. For example, when a jar is perceived by the eye, there is (between the sense and the object) the proximity of conjunction. In the perception of the colour of the jar, there is the proximity of intimate union with that which is in con- junction, because the colour is intimately united with the jar, which is in conjunction with the sense of vision. In the perception of the fact that colour generally is present, there is the proximity of intimate union with what is intimately united with that which is in conjunction, because the generic property of being coloured is inherent in the particular colour which is intimately united with the jar which is in conjunc- tion with the sense of vision. In the perception of sound by the organ of hearing, there is the proximity of intimate union, because the organ of hearing consists of the ether which resides in the cavity of the ear, and sound is a quality of ether, and there is intimate union between a quality and that of which it is the quality. In the perception of the nature of sound (in a given sound of which we are cognizant) the proximity is that of intimate union with what is intimately united, because the nature of sound is inherent in sound which is intimately united with the organ of hearing. In the perception of nonexistence, the proximity is dependent on the relation between a distinctive quality and that which</p>

<p>is so distinguished, because when the ground is (perceived to be) possessed of the nonexistence of a jar, the nonexistence of a jar distinguishes the ground which is in conjunction with the organ of vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>rr</p>
<p>Knowledge produced by these six kinds of proximity is perception. Its instrumental cause is sense. Therefore it is clear that sense is the authority for perception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for the chapter on Sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctrine here laid down respecting the nature of the proximity between the senses and their supposed objects, is a corollary to the doctrine of material and formal causes, which, as we have already shown, has been superseded in modern speculation by the simpler view of invariable se-</p>
<p>quence.</p>
<p>Instead of saying that we perceive the jar immediately, and its colour as inherent in it, modern philosophers hold that the eye takes cognizance of nothing but the colour, which is due to the reflected rays coming to the eye from the object; and from the sensation of a coloured form we infer that there is a jar, just as the sparrows inferred that there was a bunch of grapes in the picture of the Greek artist. Our interpretation of a sign may be right or wrong, but the only sign conveyed to the mind by vision is that of coloured form. Again, we do not now say that the sense of vision takes cog- nizance of the generic quality of colour as residing in any particular colour, for we hold that the term colour, generical- ly, is nothing else than a contrivance of language for the pur- pose partly of economizing words, and, more particularly, of furnishing general propositions, without which we could not</p>

<p>The subtleties about the proximity between sense and non-existence were necessary, to give completeness to the system, in which non-existence plays an active part.</p>
<p>In saying that &ldquo;sense is the authority for perception,&rdquo; the meaning appears to be that, if we incline to doubt the evidence of our senses, no reason can be given why we ought to trust it all reasoning being based on our accepting the deliverances of sense</p>

<p>rality (or universality) of a principle consists in the invariable concomitancy of one given thing with some other, as in the instance that wherever there is smoke there is fire.&rsquo; By the applicability of the principle to the case in question, is meant, . the fact that there belongs to the hill, or the like, the charac-</p>
<p>ter which is thus invariably accompanied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order that we may be enabled to trace the analogy which, disguised by differences arising from diversity in the point of view, or in the form of expression adopted, must yet necessarily exist between any two processes of reasoning, nei- ther of which is unsound, let us examine severally the terms in the foregoing passage, which we have rendered, as nearly as we could, by equivalents borrowed from the logic of Eu-</p>
<p>rope.</p>
<p>The first formal difference that requires to be noticed is the fact, that whilst the European logic employs a phraseology founded on classification, the Nyáya goes to work with the terms on which the classification is based. The former infers that kings are mortal because kings are men, a class of beings who are mortal. The latter arrives at the same inference by means of the consideration that mortality is inherent in hu- manity and humanity in kings.</p>
<p>The process of inference (anumána) is rightly distinguished by a separate name from the inference or conclusion (anumiti), the knowledge resulting from the process. This knowledge is said to be deduced from parámarsa, which we have rendered &ldquo;the knowledge of a logical antecedent.&rdquo; This, though viewed by the Naiyáyikas as the one indivisible antecedent of an inference, contains in reality the two premises which belong to the Aristotelian deductive syllogism. In the antecedent instanced in the text, there are wrapt up in one the major premiss &ldquo;all things that smoke are fiery,&rdquo; and the minor premiss, &ldquo;this hill is smoking.&rdquo; The reason for preferring to regard these as two inseparable parts of a single statement ap-</p>

<p>pears to be this, that it is only when simultaneously present to the mind that the premises suggest the inference.</p>
<p>The term which we have rendered “invariable concomitan- cy” is vyápti—“pervading inherence.&rdquo; In regard to the import of a proposition which the logic of Europe calls a Universal Affirmative, such as &ldquo;All men are mortal,&rdquo; the Naiyáyika would say that there is pervading inherence, (vyápti) of mortality in humanity-and he would state the proposition thus, &ldquo;where there is humanity, there is morta- lity.&rdquo; In a universal affirmative the predicate or major term connotes the &ldquo;pervader&rdquo; (vyápaka) or invariable concomitant of the characteristic connoted by the subject or minor term, which is &ldquo;pervaded” (vyápya) by it. The term paksha means the subject or minor term of the conclusion; and paksha-dharmmatá, the word in our text, means the possession of the character which entitles its possessor to be the sub- ject of the conclusion-the condition of a mountain, for in- stance, in so far as the vyápya, or characteristic connoted by the subject of the major premiss, (viz. &ldquo;smoke&rdquo;), belongs to the mountain which is thereby entitled to be the subject of the conclusion.</p>

<p>[[32]]</p>
<p>LECTURES ON THE</p>
<p>a private conclusion in one&rsquo;s own mind. For example, hav- ing repeatedly and personally observed, in the case of culi- nary hearths and the like, that where there is smoke there is fire, having assumed that the concomitancy is invariable, having gone near a mountain, and being doubtful as to whe- ther there is fire in it, having seen smoke on the mountain, a man recollects the invariable concomitancy of fire where there is smoke. Then the knowledge arises that &rsquo;this moun- tain is characterised by smoke, which is invariably attended by fire.&rsquo; This is called linga-parúmarsa, which means such recognition of a sign as leads to inference. Thence is pro- duced the knowledge that the &lsquo;mountain is fiery,&rsquo; which is the conclusion (anumiti). This is the process of inference for one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>यतु खयं धूमादग्निमनुमाय परम्पति बोधयितुं पञ्चावयव - वाक्यं प्रयुङ्क्ते तत्परार्थानुमानं । यथा पर्वता वह्निमान् । धूम- वत्वात् । यो यो धूमवान् स वह्निमान् यथा महानसः । तथाचायं । तस्मान्तथेति । अनेन प्रतिपादिता शिङ्गात्परो ऽप्यग्निं प्रतिपद्यते ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, after having, to the satisfaction of his own mind, inferred fire from smoke, when one makes use of the five- membered form of exposition for the instruction of another, then is the process one of inference for the sake of another. For example, (1.) The mountain is fiery; (2.) because it smokes; (3.) whatever smokes is fiery, as a culinary hearth; (4.) and this does so; (5.) therefore it is fiery as aforesaid. In consequence of the token here rendered, the other also admits that there is fire. &quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The five members of this syllogism are severally named: (1.) the proposition, (2.) the reason, (3.) the example, (4.) the application, and (5.) the conclusion. The mountain is fiery&rsquo; is the proposition; &lsquo;because of its being smoky is the rea son; &lsquo;whatever is smoky, &amp;c.&rsquo; is the example; &lsquo;and so this mountain is&rsquo; is the application; therefore the mountain is fiery&rsquo; is the conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The five-membered argument has been the object some times of undeserved censure, and sometimes of commendation equally undeserved. When it is commended, at the expense of the Aristotelian syllogism, on the allegation (see a quota- tion in Sir G. Haughton&rsquo;s Prodromus, p. 215) “that it exhibits a more natural mode of reasoning than is compatible with the compressed limits of the syllogism, and that its conclu- sion is as convincing as that of the syllogism,&rdquo; the commen- dation is based simply on a misconception of the syllogism thus disparaged. On the other hand, when it is censured as &ldquo;a rude form of the syllogism,&rdquo; the censure is unfair, because what corresponds to the syllogism is the two-membered ex- pression, which, we have already seen, comprises neither more nor less than the syllogism does; whereas the form now un- der consideration is proposed as the most convenient for communicating our convictions to others. Being a matter of exposition, it is therefore a question of Rhetoric whether the form be or be not the most convenient in which to arrange our propositions, our proofs, and our illustrations. The five-membered expression, so far as its arrangement is concerned, is a summary of Kanáda&rsquo;s views in regard to Rhetoric, &ldquo;an offshoot from Logic,&rdquo; (see Whately&rsquo;s Elements of Rhetoric, page 6), and to which, after &ldquo;the ascertainment of the truth by investigation,&rdquo; belongs &ldquo;the establishment of it to the satisfaction of another.&rdquo; Disregarding what is called rhetorical artifice, which, in his system, would have been out of place, as it would have been out of place in Eu- clid&rsquo;s Elements of Geometry, Kanáda directs his rhetorician to</p>

<p>commence, as Euclid does, by stating the proposition to be proved. The reason is next to be alleged, and then instances are to be cited in order to show that the reason is sufficient to establish the fact in regard to all cases of a certain given character. The auditor is then to be reminded that there is no dispute that the case in question is of the given character, and the oration winds up with the reintroduction of the ori- ginal proposition in the new character of an established con- clusion, just as Euclid&rsquo;s argument winds up by reintroducing the triumphant proposition with a flourish of trumpets in the shape of a &ldquo;Quod erat demonstrandum.”</p>
<p>Thus, rhetorically considered, the five-membered expression is a very suitable framework for a straight-forward argumen- tative speech, making no appeal to the passions, and not he- sitating to table, without exordium, the proposition which it proceeds to establish.</p>
<p>Logically considered, the five-membered expression is a combination of the Inductive with the Deductive syllogism. It aims at laying before an auditor, for his conviction, an ex- position, conjointly, of the two separate processes which are described as having previously led to the conviction of the speaker himself. With this view, the instances which led the speaker to an inductive generalization are directed to be cited, for the satisfaction of the auditor, in the third division of the rhetorical address-from which circumstance it has so hap- pened that those who suppose the intended function of the model oration and of the Aristotelic syllogism to be identical, have come either to regard the oration as an illogical mon- strosity, or else to fancy that it is a great improvement upon the syllogism. The former misconception is that of those who, like Ritter, (&ldquo;History of Ancient Philosophy,&rdquo; Vol. 4. p. 365), were familiarly conversant with the logic of the schools. The other misconception was to be looked for in the case of those whose notions of the logic of the schools were derived from Locke and Dugald Stewart.</p>

<p>Whilst Kanáda in his rhetorical section, gives the frame- work for a set harangue, to be delivered without interruption, Gautama supposes an opponent, and a chairman, or Speaker of the House. In his first aphorism, (see the &ldquo;Logical Ap- horisms of Gotama,&rdquo; published in Calcutta, p. 2; Colebrooke&rsquo;s Essay, p. 265; or Ward&rsquo;s &ldquo;View, &amp;c. of the Hindoos,” v. 4, p. 239,) he sketches, by an cnumeration of the sixteen topics following, what may be regarded as &ldquo;the natural history of a debate.&rdquo; What is to be admitted as proof (pramána) having been pre-determined, and the subject of discussion (prameya) having been mooted, the impartial chairman, not having yet heard the arguments, is in a state of doubt (sansaya), both as to what is the fact of the matter, and also as to there being any sufficient motive (prayojana) for entertaining the question. The asserter of the proposition explains the importance of the question, which furnishes the motive for entertaining it; and he supports his own opinion on the matter by citing examples (drishtánta) sufficient, he conceives, to make out an establish- ed casc (siddhúnta). An opponent rises, and takes the reason- ing to pieces (avayava), putting it, that is to say, into the form of the five-membered discourse, and trying to show its insufficiency. The first speaker makes a refutation (tarka) of thesc objections, and thus furnishes confirmation (nirnaya) of his own position. The objector, who, being, by hypothesis, in the wrong, is of course obstinate, begs that a fair discus- sion (váda) may be allowed; and he proceeds to offer a wrang- ling rejoinder (jalpa); and, in default of better arguments, he brings forward cavils (vitanda), fallacics (hetwábhása), am- biguous expressions, and such-like disingenuous artifices (chhala). By these unworthy proceedings he lays himself open to the confutation (játi) to which a reasoner is liable who evidently contradicts himself, and, the assembly being no longer disposed to listen to him, he is voted a nuisance, and finds himself in the predicament of being rebuked (nigra- ha-sthána) by the president, who puts him down, and declares that &ldquo;the Ayes have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>LECTURES ON THE</p>
<p>Kanáda&rsquo;s six categories belong, in the foregoing enumera- tion of topics, to the head of prameya-things, the existence of which is to be proved.</p>
<p>The point, in the course of analysing the reasoning pro- cess, at which the logic of India came to a halt, whilst that of Europe made an important step in advance, was that at which the sagacious mind of Aristotle discerned that whilst the pro- cess of induction, in all save those barren cases where every one of the individuals is included in the enumeration, must fall short of demonstrative certainty, the subsequent process of de- duction could be placed on a basis as stable as that of Mathema- tical science. It would be superfluous here to dwell upon the scientific beauty of Aristotle&rsquo;s analysis of the reasoning process. Its scientific beauty, and also its practical utility, are well known to the intelligent readers of Whately and DeMorgan ; and are hidden in deepest darkness from those who, on this point, follow Locke and misunderstand Bacon. It is not ex- actly fair to say with Ritter (&ldquo;History of Philosophy,” Vol. IV. p. 365,) that, two of the five members of Kanáda&rsquo;s argu- ment &ldquo;are manifestly superfluous, while, by the introduction of an example in the third, the universality of the conclusion is vitiated :”—for, as we have shown, the citation of the ex- ample is designed, as a matter of rhetorical convenience, to bring to the recollection of the hearer examples, in regard to which all parties are unanimous, and which are such as should constrain him to admit the universality of the principle from which the conclusion follows. The short-coming of the Nai- yáyikas consists in their having failed to perceive that the as- certainment of &ldquo;pervading inherence&rdquo; (vyápti), that is to say the process of Induction, and the subsequent process of De- duction are two processes as advantageously susceptible. of entirely separate consideration as the question of accuracy in the statement of an account and the question of accuracy in its summation-the latter being in every case a question ca- pable of demonstrative solution, and therefore convenientlywith an</p>

That the Naiyáyikas failed to per- ceive this, is less strange than that it should have been for- gotten again in Europe, as it so generally was till very re- cently. No one is perhaps more perfectly aware of the real import of the distinction here adverted to than Mr. J. S. Mill; and it is therefore matter of regret that he should have thought proper to write of the syllogism, in his “ Sys- tem of Logic,” in a sort of disparaging tone, which is calcu- lated to perpetuate misconception just in proportion to the great merit of the rest of his work. No doubt, it will have this effect only on his superficial readers; but superficial readers constitute a numerous and influential body, whom it is of great importance not to mislead.</p>

Throwing aside the needlessly assumed necessity for the citation of an exam- ple in every argument propounded to another, and waiving all dispute about the truth of the premises, the argument could be easily enough stated with a universal affirmative premiss—thus&ndash;</p>

<p>The result of this, translated into the language of Eu- ropean logic, is, that in such a case an opponent would deny the major,―viz. that &ldquo;All that is demonstrable is fiery.&rdquo; There, therefore, is a question, not of formal logic, but of fact -a question to be determined by inductive investigation.

<p>In this case, as before, the major is denied, viz.&ndash;that “ eve- ry thing created is eternal.&rdquo; Whether sound be created or uncreated is a disputed point among Indian philosophers-the grammarians, of course, taking the side in the dispute which tends most to exalt the subject-matter of their own science. Mr. Babbage assigns to sound an eternity of a different kind from that contemplated by the Hindú sages, for he argues, that the undulations, on which sound depends, being once pro- duced can never be absolutely annihilated; though, through excessive diffusion, the force becomes so diminished that our dull organs are not affected by it. Were it not, for this, we might still hear the echoes of Cicero&rsquo; eloquence haunting the Roman forum.</p>

<p>ing that any thing exists in reality corresponding to the term sabdatwa, &ldquo;the abstract nature of sound.&rdquo; Granting that there were such a thing, and that it were eternal as here assumed, there is a fallacy of equivocation in the attribution to it of the terms &ldquo;audibleness,&rdquo; and &ldquo;eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The term sabdatwa is audible, like other words, only in the sense of what is called in the Logic of the schools its supposi- tio materialis (the anukarana of the Sanskrit Grammarians) -in so far as it is a pronounceable collection of vowels and consonants; but it is held to be eternal in quite a different sense-in the sense of its being an abstract entity-in which sense it is no more audible than is the abstract nature of a jar, or any other kindred pseudo-Platonic Universal.</p>

<p>He says:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let this, for instance, be our definition; A dragon is serpent breathing flame. This proposition, considered only as a definition, is indisputably correct. A dragon is a serpent breathing flame: the word means that. The tacit assump- tion, indeed, (if there were any such understood assertion,) of the existence of an object with properties corresponding to the definition, would, in the present instance, be false. Out of this definition we may carve the premises of the following syllogism :-</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dragon is a thing which breathes flame.</p>
<p>But a dragon is a serpent;</p>
<p>From which the conclusion is</p>
<p>Therefore some serpent or serpents breathe flame :”— &ldquo;An unexceptionable syllogism, in the first mode of the third figure, in which both premises are true, and yet the conclusion false; which every logician knows to be an absur- dity. The conclusion being false, and the syllogism correct, the premises. cannot be true. But the premises, considered as parts of a definition, are true: there is no possibility of controverting them. Therefore, the premises considered as parts of a definition cannot be the real ones. The real pre- mises must be:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dragon is a really existing thing which breathes flame :&mdash;</p>
<p>“A dragon is a really existing serpent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which implied premises being false, the falsity of the conclusion presents no absurdity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“As (an example of) an argument evidently inconclusive, (suppose one were to argue), &lsquo;Sound is a quality, because it is visible&rsquo;—here (every one would perceive at once, that) visi- bility does not reside in sound, for sound is recognised by the hearing (not by vision).”</p>
<p>This is the case of notorious falsehood in the minor pre- miss,</p>

<p>&ldquo;A reason, when there is an indispensable condition, is faulty as regards comprehensiveness. Such an indispensable condition (upádhi) is what always attends the property to be established, but does not always attend what is brought forward in proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What follows is intended to elucidate the terms of this de- finition.</p>
<p>साध्यसमानाधिकर णात्यन्ताभावाप्रतियोगित्वं साध्यव्यापक- त्वं । साधनवविष्ठात्यन्ताभावप्रतियोगित्वं साधनाव्याप-</p>

<p>&ldquo;Invariable attendance on the property to be established (sádhya-vyápakatwa) consists in the not being the counter- &laquo;.</p>
<p>part (apratiyogitwa) of the absolute non-existence (atyantá- bháva) attendant on (samánádhikarana) that which is to be proved. Non-invariable attendance on what is brought for- ward in proof (sádhanávyápakatwa) consists in the being the counterpart (pratiyogitwa) of the non-existence which resides in the proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Naiyáyikas glory in this bewildering style of elucida- tion. In the present instance the question was this-&ldquo;in what consists such invariable attendance as that of wet fuel on</p>
<p>[[46]]</p>
<p>LECTURES ON THE</p>
<p>smoke ?&rdquo; In order that the answer might be sufficiently adorned with obscurity, the term Non-existence, the great ally in the mystification of language, is called into council; and it is determined that, so far as concerns the production of smoke, there is the non-existence of every thing that is not required for its production. For example, jars are not indis- pensable, nor elephants, nor astronomical calculations, nor an indefinite number of other things, the non-existence of all of which is compatible with the production of smoke. The counterpart (pratiyogi) of the non-existence of any thing be- ing the thing itself, and the counterparts of all the non-exis- tences compatible with the production of smoke being all those things that are not indispensable for its production, it follows that the characteristic of the indispensable is its being something different from all these-or, as our author express- es it, its not being the counterpart of any of these non- existences. Such, in the case of smoke, is the part performed by wet fuel, which is not the counterpart of the non-existence of jars, &amp;c, but is the counterpart of the non-existence of it- self-a non-existence which is not compatible with the pro- duction of smoke.</p>
<p>The second definition is the converse of this.</p>

<p>&quot; ( Suppose it to be argued that ), &lsquo;The mountain must smoke, because it is fiery&rsquo;-in this case the contact of wet fuel is an indispensable condition. For wherever there is smoke, there</p>
<p>NYÁYA PHILOSOPHY.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>[[47]]</p>
<p>there is the conjunction of wet fuel&rsquo;-so that we have here invariable attendance on what is to be proved (sádhyavyápa- katá). But it is not true that wherever there is fire, there there is conjunction of wet fuel&rsquo;-for there is no conjunction of wet fuel in the case of an (ignited) iron ball-so we have here non-invariable attendance on the proof (sádhanávyápa- katá). As there is thus its invariable attendance on what is to be proved, the contact of wet fuel is an indispensable con- dition for the sufficiency of the reason alleged. As it would require this additional condition (in order to prove that smoke must be present), fieriness (in the argument before us) is faul- ty as regards comprehensiveness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An argument proposed in the form &ldquo;The mountain is fie ry-therefore it must smoke,&rdquo; is called an Enthymeme-be- cause, only one of the premises being expressed, the other is regarded as remaining in the mind (en thymo) of the reason- er. In the case of a fallacy propounded as an Enthymeme [see Whately&rsquo;s Logic, Book 3, § 1.] it is impossible to tell whether the fallacy is in the form or in the matter. For example, the suppressed premiss in the present case may be either &ldquo;Some things when ignited are smoky,&rdquo; or &ldquo;All things where ignited are smoky.&rdquo; On the former alterna- tive, the fallacy is the formal one of undistributed middle; on the other alternative, the major premiss is false, as proved in the text by the instance of the ignited iron ball. The Nyaya, which takes no notice of formal fallacies, assumes that the suppressed premiss is in the form in which, if its truth were conceded, it would really establish the point in question : for example-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is ignited smokes; &ldquo;The hill is ignited;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore it smokes.”</p>
<p>The instance of the ignited iron ball enables us merely to deny the Major premiss of this syllogism. It is not unfre-T</p>

<p>quently useful, however, to know not merely that something is wrong, but to know how far it is wrong-or what amount of correction would make it right. With this view the case may be regarded as falling under the head of the procedure a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter,&rdquo; that is to say &ldquo;from an assertion with a qualifying condition, to the same assertion without the qualification.&rdquo; Thus, if we con- cede to the Naiyáyika his theory of smoke, we may say with him that &ldquo;Whatever is ignited-provided there is the con- junction of wet fuel-smokes&rdquo;-from which, however, we cannot go on to infer that the hill, being simply ignited, smokes. There the reason (fieriness) is “secundum quid” (sopádhika) in the major premiss, and the fallacy consists in the dropping of the “quid” (upádhi) in the minor.</p>

<p>On the three kinds of wrong notion it may be remarked, that the first, or doubt, ceases when one of the conflicting natures excludes the rest; the result, however, may still be a wrong notion of the second kind, or a mistake; for our doubt ceases when we become sure that a given object is a man, though in reality it be a post. Mistake ceases, when, by more careful examination or by other means, an apprehension of the real nature of the thing displaces the erroneous appre- hension. The third kind of error is that where no further examination is required, the want of logical perspicacity being all that prevents the individual from perceiving that the opinion which he entertains is inconsistent with admitted</p>

<p>Faculty (sanskára) is of three kinds, momentum, imagi nation, and elasticity. Momentum (vega ) resides in the four beginning with Earth, and in Mind. Imagination (bhá- vana), the cause of memory and arising from notion, resides phet only in the Soul. Elasticity (sthitisthápaka) is that which restores to its former position what had been altered. It resides in mats and the like formed of the earthy element.</p>
<p>&quot; So much for the Qualities. &quot;</p>
<p>It may seem strange to class together things in which any common ground of classification is so little apparent as in the qualities of momentum, imagination, and elasticity. We offer the following conjectural explanation-that for the pro-</p>

<p>duction of such an effect, or the establishment of such a product, as a jar, two causes at least must co-operate; viz. the maker and the material:-for the clay may be said to make the jar, as reasonably as the potter can be said to make it. So again, in order that there may be Perception, both the Mind and an external Object must co-operate. But equally in the case of the Mind&rsquo;s exerting the faculty of Memory; of a bent bow&rsquo;s righting itself on the removal of the strain; and of a body&rsquo;s continuing its course after dis- junction from that which originated the motion, an agent is recognized as operating by itself. Looking at the etymology of the word sanskára—(sam “with,&rdquo; and kri “do”)-one might imagine the word to be better fitted to express what is done, by the mind, &amp;c. in co-operation with something clse, than what is done without such co-operation: but occa- sionally, in a compound verb, the separate force of the con- stituent elements is nearly as little obvious as the character</p>

<p>Most of the commentators on the Nyaya appear to have overlooked the necessity for defining the connotation of the term sanskára. We have been able to meet with only one attempt to define it-the explanation being to this effect, that a sanskára, acting as a cause, reproduces itself as an effect.</p>
