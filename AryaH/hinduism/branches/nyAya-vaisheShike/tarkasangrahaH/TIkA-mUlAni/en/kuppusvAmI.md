### PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION  
Pdniniyam ca sarvasastropakarakam. 
"JLogicand grammar are indispensable aids for ^every branch of knowledge." --.-^* This little book, called A PRIMER OF IKDIAWLOGIC, is primarily based on Annambhatta's Tarka samgraha and is designed to serve as an introduction, not only to the btudy of Indian logic as embodied in the Nyaya-Vaisesika literature in Sanskrit, but also to the study of Indian philosophy in its diverse systems. In preparing this book, the oft-quoted Sanskrit dictumgiven above was borne in mind. This book comprises three paits. Part I contains an historical introduction. Part II gives the Sanskrit text of the Tarkasamgrahain the Dcvanfijjari script and in English transliteration. Part III forms the bulk of this work and contains an English rendering of the Sanskrit text accompanied bya critical and comparative exposition of each topic in English. In this exposition, an endeavour is made to combine strict fidelity to the original Sastraic texts in Sanskrit with an intelligible presentation of the techni cal ideas of Indian systems of philosophyin an English garb. In the course of this endeavour, it has becomeunavoidably necessary to coin and bring into voguecertain technical terms, which, at first sight, look some what uncouth.
ft   
Nearly two years ago,I undertook to write this book for the benefit of modern University students, more especially B.A. students offering philosophy as their optional subject,in compliance with a suggestion made by my esteemed friend, Prof. P. N. Srinivasa chariar, M.A., Professor of Philosophy in the Pachai yappa's College, Madras. Messrs. P. Varadachari & Co., Publishers and Book-sellers, 8, Linga Chett) Street, Madras.^SSflfJly undertook to publish this work. Theprinting of partsII and III was finished in January1931 and these two parts were separately made avail 
able to students in the beginning of 1931. The com plete work, with partI also and a very useful Sanskrit glossary, is now made available in a complete form;and in this form, it is hoped that it will be received well by all the students and scholars interested in Indian philosophy. 
The bulk of the matter in this book is directly based on Sastraic texts in Sanskrit. In the course ofthe preparation of this work, I consulted well-knownEnglish books on Indian philosophy like Prof. Radha krishnan's ' Indian Philosophy', Dr. Keith's< Atomismand Indian Logic', and Dr. Handle's 'Indian Logic in the Early Schools'. My thanks are due, in particular, to two of my young friends and former pupils to Mr. T. R. Chintamani, M.A., Senior Lecturer in Sans krit, Madras University,for preparing the table ofcontents and the Sanskrit glossary, and to Mr. T.Chandrasekharan, M.A., (Diplomain German), Profes sor of History of Sanskrit Language and Literature, Madras Sanskrit College, and Manager, Journal oftts   
Oriental Research, Madras, for reading the proofs.I should also take this opportunity to express my thank fulness to the Madras Law Journal Press, Mylapore,for its very kind and efficient co-operationin seeing this work through the press and to Pandit T. S. Subrahmanya Sastri (Sahitya-$iromani) of the M.L.J.Press* for the alert and willing assistance which herendered at various stages in getting me to do the workin the midst of my multifarious duties.

A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGICPART I 
INTRODUCTION
  

SECTION I   
PRELIMINARY: LOGIC IN THE WEST AND IN INDIA 
IrCthe cultural history of Europe, over twenty-two centuries ago, thinking,like speaking, needed an elucidative and regulativeaid and found it in a distinct branch of investigation, which was founded and orga nised in Greece by Aristotle and which came to be designated Logic. It is significant that the name logic is etymologically connected with the Greek word logos, which denotes both 'thought* and 'word* or 'discourse*. The significance of this etymological connection can be adequately appreciatedif h is remembered that logic, in its rise and development in the western world, particularly in Greece, was closely connected with rhetoric. Thus the name logic is of a tell-tale character in its application to logicin the West ; and it may be taken to indicate how, almost from its very rise, western logic found, itself in the firm grip of formalism andhow it took more than twenty centuries for the scientific method underlying Aristotle's Organon to be redeemed, brought into prominence and implementedin the Nqvum Organum of Francis Bacon (1561-1626). The term logic should not be taken to carry with it all these implications of European history when it is usedin the phrase Indian logic. This phrase is usually rendered by the Sanskrit equivalents &nvl%fiki
iv A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART r   
ny&yavistara, nysyadarsatoa, tarTtoSastra and pramana-&stra. It is also usual to describe Indian logic by the anglicised phrase Nyaya-Vaisesika system and it is usually described thus in this work. ( All these phrases are significant and appropriate in one way or other, particularly in view of the place which Indian logic occupies in the cultural history of India and of the manner in which it arose and grew not as a meregrammar of thinking, but as an orthodox (astikay system of philosophy with a specialstress on the science of methodical reasoning in both its inductive anddeductive aspects,this science forming its dominantand distinctive part. Indian logic is anviksikl or nyayavistara or nydyladarsatoa in the sense! that it is a philosophical system, of which methodical reasoning or investigation of knowledge got through observation. or perception and trustworthy verbal testimony forms the central theme; it is pre-eminently the science of ratiocination or tarkasdstra; and in contrast with the fadasdstra or 'the science of grammar' ( Vydkarana) and with the vdkyasdsira or 'the exegetics' (Mlmdmsa) y it is described as the pramdnasdstra or the epistemo logical science, chiefly concerned with valid knowledge and its sources. That Indian logic is usually described as the Nyaya-Vaisesika system is not because it is the result of the syncretism of the two opposing systems Nyaya realism and Atomistic pluralism ; rathei;it is so described because at a very early stagein the history of Indian logic, the Vaiseika stress on the inductive phase of inference came to be synthesized with its deductive phase in the Nyaya theory of *:\\ :,V^ reasoning.SEC. i] INTRODUCTION v  
Those who are familiar with Western logic and desirous of studying Indian logic from a historical and com parative point of view will do well to bear in mind the fact that, while one may find striking parallels in the Indian and Western systems of logic, one should not bemisled^ by such parallels and lose sight of the funda mental differences in respect of scope and method,which Indian logic discloses in its rise and development,as compared with Western logic. 
SECTION II 
ANTECEDENTS AND FORESHADOWINGS OF THE VAISESIKA AND NYAYA 
The story of India's quest for truth and of India's attempts to lay out suitable ways and approaches to truth is long and varied and it has been reconstructed with a considerable measure of success by several eminent scholars, Indian and alien, from the ancient literary monuments of India, which are mostly in the form of Sanskrit works. In all this quest and these attempts, a careful student of the history of Indian philosophical thought may discern, almost from the very beginning, two tendencies the intwitio'nistic and
the rationalistic, and two chief aims the achievementof Dharma and the realisation of Brahman. If one ofthe Rg-Vedic seers could be said to have boldly intuited the monistic absolute in the well-known verse"ThatOne breathed breathlessly by itself"(Anldav&tamsvadhaya tadekam: Rv. .X.129.2),it would not be
Ti A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART   
far-fetched to find the rationalistic exhortation ofanother Rg-Vedic seer in the verse "Meet one another, discuss and understand your minds"(Samgacchadh vam samvadadhvam saw vo mandmsi j&nat'&m : Rv. X.191.2). These two tendencies came to exhibit themselves throughout the Vtdic age,in close association with the two aims mentioned abovt.. Onone side, as a result of the influence of the rationalistic tendency on the ritualistic aspect of the Veda, ritualistic and exegetic doctrines, which, in due time, emerged as Jaimini's system of Purva-Mimarhsa, were developed. And, on the other side, the combined workings of the intuitionistic and rationalistic tendencies in the direc tion of spiritual insight and knowledge of truth led to the emergence of the Upanisadic philosophy of Atman.This philosophy was marked by a pronounced emphasis on the efficacy and value of intuition, which culminated in Badarayana's system of Vedanta. The dominantfeature of the philosophy of the Upanisads is its monistic absolutism, which led up, within the Upani-$adic period itself, to rationalistic reactions of different types^ representing collateral and casual phases of Upaniadic thought-V-some of them coming to besystematised later on in the dualism and realism of Kapila's S&mkhya and the allied discipline of Pata fijali's Yoga, some others eventually giving rise to the pluralistic rationalism of KanSda's Vaisesika systemand its complementary Ny&ya of Gautama, and yet others emerging as anti- Vedistic rebels ip the form ofthe Jaina may-be-ism (sy8dvtida),the Bauddha idealism and nihilism (Sunyav&da), and the
SEC. n] INTRODUCTION vii   
Carvaka materialism. All these post-Upanisadic sys tems came to be called darsanos (darfondtoS).It should be noted here that the term 'system*is very inadequate as the English equivalent of the Sanskrit word 'darsana'. While the former word bringsinto prominence the idea of systematisation,the latter wordbringjHnto relief the fact that the plenary intuition of truth or spirit (tatlvadarsana or dtmadarsana),whicl a gifted saint or seer came to have, lies at the root of every system of Indian philosophy and forms its fruit also. A long-established and widely acceptedtradition classifies these darSanas into dstika and nastika. ) Thehistory of the meaning of these two words throws somelight on the manner in which the ground of classifica tion happened to be shifted under varying circums tances. Panini's sutra 4.4.60 (asti ndsti distant ntatih) gives the derivation of the words astika, nastika anddaistika: and according to Panini, dstika is 'one whobelieves in the other world', n&stika is 'one who does not believe in the other world' and daistika is a <pre destinarian* or 'fatalist'. This is the oldest recorded explanation of these words. On the basis of this expla nation, even Jainism, and Buddhism in some of its aspects, could be described as dstika systems. An old popular tradition would take the word dstika in the sense of 'one who believes in God'. If this should be accepted, Jaimini's Purva-MimSmsa and Kapila's Sariikhya, which are usually included in the astika list, ought to be dropped from that list, as they do not recognise Itvara. A post-Buddhistic, but pre-Christian, tradition fixed the meaning of the word dstika as 'one
Yiii A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PAKT i   
who believes in the infallibility and the supremeauthority of the Veda' and of the word ndstika as 'one who does not believe in it*. This tradition has 
been widely accepted for a long time. According to this, the Samkhya and Yoga, the VaiSesika and Nyaya,the Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta are described as dstika-darsanas, and the Carvaka, Jaina and Bauddhasystems as nQstika-dartanas. In this context, wheneverthe terms orthodox and heterodox happen to be used as the English equivalents of Qstika and nastika, it should be remembered that they have reference to belief anddisbelief in the authority of the Veda. 
Though the first beginnings of the Vaiseika andNyaya systems are misty in certain respects, a careful student is not likely to miss the foreshadowings of the central doctrine of these systemsin the Upanisads. In the well-known three-fold scheme of self-culture lead 
ing to self-realisation, as taught in the oft-quoted Upanisadic text"Verily, Maitreyi, the Spirit should be realised, heard, discussed and constantly contem plated upon'9(Atma vft are dratfavyas srotavyo mantavyo nididhyasitavyah Brhad. IV. 5),it is generally accepted that hearing or initial comprehension
(iravana) representsthe inaugural stage, investigation and discussion with the help of reason (manana)represent the central stage and constant contemplation 
(nididhy&sana) stands for the culminating stage. Thegrim spiritual teacher of the Katfiopanisad, Death(Yama), pulls up the rationalist of the Upanisadic agewith the warning"Self-realisation cannot be got
SEC. ii ] INTRODUCTION is   
through ratiocination or tarka" (NaisQ tarkena matird paneya Katha II. 9). From these foreshadowingsof deliberate attempts to exercise reason, when consi dered together with the fact that philosophical debates such as those that were carried on under the auspices of Ajatasatru and Janaka were very common duringthe Up^anisadic age, the inference is irresistible that, already during the period of the Uoanisads, somelogical doctrines should have not only begun to appear, but also progressed beyond the nebulous stage. 
SECTION III 
How THE VAISESIKA AND NYAYA SCHOOLS EMERGED AND WHEN THEIR DOCTRINES WERE REDACTED INTO SUTRAS 
(liefore the end of the Upanisadic period and prior to the advent of the Buddha, the Vedic scriptures embodying the results of the intuitive insight of the Vedic and Upanisadic seers had asserted their authority so far as to persuade a large section of rationalistic 
thinkers to agree to play second fiddle to scriptural authorities. This should have resulted in the develop ment of the pre-Buddhistc Nyaya method in close asso ciation with Vedic exegesis and accounts for the earlier use of the term Nyaya in the sense of 'the principles and the logical method of Mimamsa exegetics/ Thisalso accounts for the fact that, even after the disentan glement of the Nyaya logic from Vedic exegetics, the legislators of ancient India like Manu and Yajnavalkya
x A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART i   
emphatically recognised the importance and value oflogical reasoning (tarka)in a correct comprehensionof dharma as taught by the Vedas (Manu XII. 105and 106; Yajnavalkya I. 3). Another section of rationalistic thinkers who did not agree to play second fiddle to scriptural authorities, perhaps developed andexpounded rationalistic doctrines on independent lines, without subjecting themselves to the thraldom of Vedicreligion and philosophy. Some of these doctrines perhaps shaped themselves into the Samkhya thoughtof the pre-Buddhistic stage, with a marked degree of hostility to Vedic ritualism. Some other doctrines ofthis kind gave rise to the pre-Buddhistic logic andand metaphysics of the Vaisesika, with a special leaning in favour of the inductive method of reasoning based on observation and analysis and with a simple rationa listic scheme of two sources of valid knowledge perception and inference (pratyaksa and anumana). It is very likely that the anti-Vedic speculations of thepre-Buddhistic Samkhya and the anti-Vedic logic andepistemology of the pre-Buddhistic Vaisesika paved the way for the development and systematisation ofBuddhism.} It may here be borne in mind that Buddhistic tradition, as preserved in ancient Chinese records, readily recognises the priority of the Samkhyaand the Vaisesika to Buddhism. (SeeUi's Vaisesika Philosophy, pages 3 and 4. ) 
[About the fifth century B. C., when the anti-Vedic movements of Buddhism rose and began to spread, the exponents of Vedic philosophy and religion keenly felt the need for showing greater accommodation to
SEC. in] INTRODUCTION xi   
rationalistic modes of thought. The rationalistic resources available for Vedic religion and philosophy had to be pooled together and kept fit for defensive andoffensive use, as against the impact from collision with avaidika developments. On the one side, it was foundeasy to disentangle from its Vedistic environment the logical method (Nyaya) of Vedic exegetics; and on the other side, to bring the unfettered methods of reasoning and analysis known to the early Vaisesika under the influence of the attempts for rapprochement made bythe Vaidika thinkers turned out to be an easy taskr chiefly as a result of the disquieting nihilistic excesses of early Buddhism. Thus, the Nydya of the Vedicexegesis and the logic and metaphysics of the early anti-Vedic Vaisesika came to fraternise with each otherand gave rise to two sister-schools of philosophical reasoning the Vaisesika school mainly concerned withinductive observation and analysis, and the Nyatyaschool chiefly concerned with the formulation andelucidation of the principles of ratiocination on thebasis of inductive reasoning. These two schools should have appeared in a fairly definite form, with their characteristic methods of reasoning and metaphysics, bythe middle of the fourth century B. C., though the chief doctrines of these schools came to be systematised andredacted in their basic sutras at a relativelylater date, This statement may receive good support from the following facts, if they could be taken to be conclusively established. Bhadrabahu, a Jaina sage, whose activity as a Jaina logician may be assigned to about 357 B. C,was quite familiar with an old theory of ten-membered
xii A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC   
syllogism. The Nyaya logic was known to Katyayanaof the fourth century B. C, as Goldstucker has shownin his work on 'Pflnini and his Place in Sanskrit Litera 
ture*. Badarayana's Vedanta-sutras (Il-ii11 to 17) definitely presuppose the VaiSesika. The Lalitavistara and Milindapaftha mention the Vaiseika. Even the 
Vaie?ika-sutras, which were, in all probability, pro duced later than the middle of the fourth century B. C, do not controvert any of the Buddhistic doctrines, while Buddhistic tradition generallyre cognises the prc-Buddhistic origin of the Vaiscsika. These considerations, which tend to show that the Nyaya and Vaieika schools came into being in a definite form before the middle of the fourth century B. C, cannot be lightly brushed aside. 
The doctrines of these two sch>ols were syste tnatised and redacted in the form of the Nyaya-sutras and Vaisesika-sutras. The authorship of the former is ascribed to Gautama, and that of the latter to Kanada. According to the generally accepted Indian tradition, which goes back to the early centuries of the Christian era, Gautama is otherwise known as Aksapadaand Kanada is otherwise known as Uluka and Kasyapa. It will be obvious to those who are familiar with the traditions of ancient India that Aksapada was the personal name and Gautama the gotra name of the author of the Nyaya-sutras, and that Kanfida andUl&ka are the personal names and Kafyafa the gotra name of the author of the Vaieika-sutras, in the same way as Paksilasv&min is the personal name andthe gotra name of the author of the
SEC. in] INTRODUCTION xiii   
Nyayabhasya. Though the exact dates of Kanada andGautama are not known, the dales of their sutras canbe fixed within fairlydefinite limits. Jacobi,in his well-known article on the date of the philosophical sutras (Journal of the American Oriental Society XXXI. 1911), endeavours to show that the Nyaya sutrai and the Brahma-sutras were redacted between 200 and 500 A.D., that the Vaiseika-sutras andMimamsa-sutras were redacted at a somewhat earlier date, that the redaction of the Yoga-sulras should beassigned to about 450 A. D., and that the sathkhya sutras were produced at a much later date, later than the fourteenth century. With regard to the Sarfikhya sutras, it is generally acceptedthat they were composedlater than the fourteenth century, though the Tattva samdsa, which may be regarded as the nucleus of the basic sutras of the Sarhkhya system, is perhaps older than Isvarakrna and the Christian era and is certainly older than the Bhagavadajjuka, a farce earlier than the seventh century A. D. (See Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, Vol. II. pages 145 to 147).If the Bhiksu-sutra referred to in IV. iii.110 of Panini's Asfadhyayl and the Brahma-sutra mentioned in XIII.4
of the Gita could be taken to refer to Badarayana's Brahmasutras, it would be difficult to accept, without due reservations, Jacobi's argument in its application to the Vedanta-sutras. The name Patanjali, borne by the 
author of the Yoga-sutras, presents some difficulties to Jacobi, as the date of Patanjali, the author of the Mahabhasya, is acceptedto be the middle of the 2nd century B. C But Jacobi would attempt to differentiate
xiv A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART i   
the author of the Mahabhasya from the author of the Yoga-sutras, though, as a matter of fact, the ancient tradition identifyingthe two Patafijalis is sound andmaintainable on reasonable grounds. The central point jf Jacobifs argument relates to the internal evidences furnished by the nature of the Buddhist doctrines con troverted in some of these sutras. The Nyaya-sutras, according to Jacobi, refute the nihilistic suntya-vdda of Nagarjuna (3rd century A. D. circa) and do not refute the idealistic vijft&na-v&da of Asanga and Vasubandhu(middle of the 4th century A. D.). But, according to Vatsyayana and VacaspatimiSra, the Nyaya-sutra IV. 2.26 refutes the vijiiQna-vada. It should also be remembered here that the Sftnya-vada and vtjn&na-v&da doctrines were not introduced in the world for the first time by Nagarjuna and Asanga and Vasubandhu andthat, before these Buddhist teachers, these old doctrines had been in existence for a long time. Even if this line of argument adopted by Jacobi should be accepted as satisfactory, it does not touch the VaiSesika- sutras; and if the obverse of this argument were to be applied to these sutras, the logical result would be that they should be held to be pre-Buddhistic, Kautaliya Artha SSstra mentions the types of thought comprising tinvikfikl in the statement : Sdmkhyam yogo lokdya* tarn cety&nvikfilti (Vol. I. page 27, Trivandrum edi 
tion). Though the date of the Kautaliya is not yet finally settled, the general trend of well-informed andunprejudiced opinion among Indian and alien Indo logists is in favour of assigningthat great work to 304B. C. In this extract from the Kautaliya, there is noSEC.HI] INTRODUCTION xv   
specific mention of Nyaya or Vaise$ika as such. Atten tion is drawn by Ui and Randle to noteworthy cases ofparallelism between the Vaisesika-siitras and Ny&ya sutras, in which it would be more reasonable to say that the former sutras were used in the composition of the latter (See Ui's 'VaiseSika philosophy', Introduction, page 16, note 1 ; and Randle's 'Indian Logic in the Early Schools', Introduction, page 7, note i ). There is evidence to show that the sixth Jaina schism ( J8 A,D.)presupposes the Vaieika redaction (TJi's 'VaiSe sika philosophy9, Introduction, page 34), Chiefly, onthese grounds, it is surmised by several scholars that the Vaiseika-sutras should have been redacted in the pre-Christian era, subsequent to 300 B.C.; and that the Nyaya-sutras should have been redacted about the time of Nagarjuna and Deva, between 150 and 250A. D. may be inferred from the fact that the sutras 2.2.17 19 seem to presuppose the refutatory commentsin Nagarj una's Vigra^avyavartanl on the realistic position regarding the relation between pramana andprameya (Ui's Vaihsika Philosophy, Introduction pages 84 to 86). Randle concludes that the "VaiSe ika and Nyaya were systematised between 200 B. Cand 200 A. D., the Vaisesika being the earlier of the two1 ';and that "the indications, such as they are, point to the beginning of the first century A. D., as the latest date for the systematisation of the Vaieika". (Randle's 'Indian Logic in the EarlySchools9, Introduction, pages 16 and 17.) 
These conclusions, based as they are on goodgrounds as far as they go, would appear to require
xvi A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART i   
reconsideration on a careful scrutiny of all the evidences available. That the redaction of the Nyaya sutras presupposes that of the Vaisesika-sutras may bereadily admitted. It is not easy to establish that theVaisesika-sutras were redacted subsequent to 300 B. C,on the ground that the name Vaise?ika is not contained in the extract from the Kautaliya quoted above. 'Thosewho are sufficiently familiar with the use of the wordyoga in its old sense of vaiseslka, as it is found used, for instance, in Vatsyayana's bhasya on 1.1.29, are not likely to consider it a strained interpretation to take the word yoga, as used in the Kautaliya, in the sense of vaise$iTfa. In fact, according to Vacaspatimisra's T&tparyatikG and the BhGsyacandra on the bhasyaon 1.1.29, the word yoga may be taken in the somewhat comprehensive sense of Nyaya, including the Vaisesika, the Nyaya being a philosophical school laying special stress upon yoga or yuftti or reasoning (yogo tyuktih pradhanataya vidyate yesdm
BhQsyacandra). Further, in the extract quoted above from the Kautaliya, scholars have generally overlooked one important point, to which sufficient prominence oughtto be given in this connection. In chapter 2, the Vidyasamuddesa section of the Kautaliya, the chief branches of knowledge (vidya), according to Kautalya, are stated at the outset. These are four: anwKsiki (logic and philosophy), trayl (the Vedic religion and philosophy of dhartna andadharma), vartfi (the economic science and philosophy of wealth) aud dandatnlti (the science and philosophy of polity). Then there is a reference to the view of
SEC. in] INTRODUCTION xvii   
the Manavas (Manu's disciples or ancient legislators), according to which anviksikl should be regardedas aspecial part of trayi. This view, it may be noted, is consistent with the spirit of the Vedic and Upaniadicage, when logic (Nyaya) had not yet been disentangled from its applicationsto Vedic religion and philosophy. Ther^ is also a further reference to the materialistic doctrine of the Carvakas (the followers of Brhaspati), that trayi (including anviitsikl)is only a pretension or imposture of one who knows the ways of the world andthat only varta and dandanitl should be reckoned withas the two real vidyas. The followers of Usanas (the teacher of the Asuras) are afterwards referred to as recognising only one vidyd viz., the dandanitl. At the end of this chapter, Kautalya reiterates his views aboutthe four branches of learning and explains their nature and aim. In the concluding para of this chapter, hemakes two important observations. One is to the effect that anviksikl consists of Sarhkhya, Yoga andLokayata. The other is that anviksikl is helpful to the world through its ratiocinative process in the investiga tion of the soundness or unsoundness of the conclu sions and doctrines of the different branches of know

It is evident here that Ka-ttaliya elucidates the twotneanings of the term twltsikl. One is the general rsense, philosophical enquiry or philosophy. In this 
tsense, it is used in the first sentence of the above ex tract. As already pointed out, the word yogah in this sentence refers to the VaiSe$tka logic;c r even if it be taken in the special sense of the yoga discipline of Patafi jali's system, the word lok&yata does not refer to the materialism of the Carvakas, but very probably it refers to the logic of the Vaisejika and Nya\a in its secular ised form and as disentangled from its Vedic associa tions. It shonlJ be noted here that the view of the Carvaka materialist is separately mentioned in a pre vious part of the same chapter and Kautalya rejects it and is not prepared to bring the Can aka doctrine underany recognised vidyd or branch of learning. VatsyS yana, in the concluding part of his bhasya on l.l-l, amplifies the second sense of the word tinvlksiki, i.e. Mogic which investigates by means of rationalistic methods' (hetubhiranviksawans) and gives Kaujalya's Terse quoted above, with its last quarter modified as 
vidyoddefe Pfakirtitd". It is quite clear from this amended quarter of the verse, as given by Vatsyayanaf that he is quoting from the ^ idyasamuddeSa section ofthe Kautallya. It is hardly necessary to point out that a careful consideration of the above extract from the
SBC. m] INTRODUCTION xix   
Kautallya in comparison with its striking parallel in Vats>ayana's bhasya on 1.1.1 would make it very diffi cult to believe that Qnvlksikl, in the sense of 'system oflogic', was not presupposed by the Arthas&stra ofKautalya. Further, a careful consideration of the ex. tract from Nagarjuna's Vigrahavyfaartanl, which \3\ gives in pages 84 and 85 of his introduction to th* 'Va'sesitia philosophy', in comparison with its parallel in the Nyaya-suiras 2.2.17 19, would tend to show that Nagarjuna is presupposing these sutras and refuting the view embodied in them, rather than support Ui's inference in the reverse direct ior\. Patanjali,at the endof his t.'tdfya on Panini's 3.2.123, remarks "Otherthinkers hold that there is nothing known as the present time" (Apara dhandsti rartamdnah kdla tti) and gives five verses in support of this view. Thisportion of the Mahabhaya closes with the remark
Another thinker holds that there is such a thing as the present time, and it is not perceived in the sameway as the Sun's motion is not perceived" (Apara dha
asti variamanah kdlah] and supports this view withone verse. Between this portion of the Mahabhasyaand the Nyaya-sutras 2.1.40 44, there is a striking parallelism, which none can miss. A careful consider ation of these two texts would lead to the impression that Patanjali is here using not only the ideas in the Nyaya-sutras referred to, but also the phraseology in those sutras, in his characteristically graphic narrationof of a discourse between two imaginary dialogists. All these considerations may reasonably lead to the conclusion that the Vaiesika-sutras and the Nyaya-
xx A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART i   
sutras were redacted between the middle of the fourth century and second century B. C., perhaps towards the end of the fourth century B. C., the Vaisesika-sutras being earlier than the Nyaya-sutras. 
SECTION IV 
THE NAMES VAISESIKA AND NYAYA; THE NATURE,AIM AND SCOPE OF THE TWO SYSTEMS 
It is generally accepted that the names Vaisesika darsana and Nyaya-dartana are based upon the terms viSesa and nya$a. It is not possible now to ascertain exactly what these two terms signified to the early exponents of these two systems, who were responsible for devising and introducing these two names. Accor ding to an old tradition recorded by the Chinese Bud dhists Ci-tsan (549-623 A.D.) and Kwhei-ci (632- 682 A. D.), Kanada's work came to be called the Vai Sesika-sastra, since it excelled works of the other systems, more especially the Sarhkhya and it was diffe rentiated from them, the term vaisesika being taken in the sense of 'superiorto* or 'distinct from'. (See Ui's Vaisesika Philosophy pp, 3 to 7). Indian tradition is in favour of connecting the name Vaisesika with the doctrine of specialities (visesah}, visesa being regarded as the distinctive category of the Vaisesika scheme of categories. The Vaisesika-sutra 1.1.4 which practi cally represents the beginning of Kanada's sutras, lays special emphasis, not upon any of the categories, but upon 'the comprehension of truth through similarities and dissimilarities' (sadhai myavaidharmyabhyam
SEC. iv] INTRODUCTION xxi   
tattvajnanam) upon the striking out of the one in the many- and this amounts to an unmistakable stress on'the analytic or inductive method of philosophical reasoning'. Gautama's Nydya-darsana took its namefrom nyaya, which means 'the synthetic or deductive method of syllogistic demonstration*. Gautama'ssystem 'lays particular stress on the synthetic methodof syllogistic reasoning. One of the earlier mea nings of the term nyaya is 'exegetic principle ormaxim'; and after logical reasoning had beenreleased from Vedic exegesis, the term nydyadeveloped the specialised sense of syllogistic reasoning. The appropriateness of using the term toyaya,in this specialised sense, as the name of Gautama's system lies not only in the historical connection between the Nyayaand MImamsa systems; but it lies also in the fact that the term nyaya means illustration or example and that example (udaharana)is the most important of the five members constituting Gautama's syllogistic expression. Thus it may be seen that the names vaisesikaandnydya may be connected with the two aspects of sound reaso ning the analytic or inductive aspect which mountsup from particulars (visesa)to the general or universal (sdmdnya) and the synthetic or deductive aspect whichmoves on from the universal (sdmanya) to the parti culars (vise$a). In these logical notions, it would be in keeping with the history of Indian philosophical thought to recognise the basis of the names, vaifefika' and nyaya, rather than in the ontological doctrines of atomism and pluralistic realism. This would account better for the way in which the interrelation of the
A PRIAJER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART i   
Vaiesika and the Njaya came to be conceived of as two sister systemsin spite of their differences on themetaphysical side. 
The Vaisesika and the Nyaya, in their early andlater phases, are not restricted in their scope and aimto logic in a narrow sense. Like other Indian systems, these two form sell -contained philosophical disciplines of a complex character, with a distinctive central themecorrelated to thtir special goal. The final cessation ofall miseries (apavarga)is the goal of the Vaisesika and the Nyaya. The VaistSfika stresses the analytical side of rea oning and furnishes the metaphysical back ground and the inductive basis of the Njaya system. With the VaiSesika material, suitably modified in minordetails, the Nyaya builds up a complete system of
pistemology and logic, combined to some extent withpsychology, ethics, ontology and religion. Such a mixed composition of Indian philosophical systems is due not to any lack of appreciation of differences of value in different things, but rather to the cultural outlook of India, which is dominated by an intense desire to synthesise all the departments of knowledgein a scheme ot progressive realisation of life's endsculminating in final emancipation (mukti) conceived of as the sunitnmn bonum. Methodical reasoning, involving a critical investigation of knowledge got through perceptual experience and verbal testimony, i.e., anvikfd, with the help of the five-membered schemeOf syllogistic expression (nydya or pQ%c&vayavavakyti)> forms the distinctive contribution of the Njaya to phi

lo&ophical thou< ht. Since its first redaction, the Nyayasystem has permanently secured for itself a position ofimportance in the Hindu scheme of Vedic religion ardphilosophy, chiefly by the ancillary role which it hasassumed in its n laiion to the Veda; and if the Vaisesika also is given a place among- the dstika systems,it is duemainly to its fraterrity with ih N\aya. Gokulanatha,, a Naiyayika of the 16 h Century A.D, suggests in his philosophical drama, called Amrlodaya, that Anviksiklis the amaz nian oonimander-in-thief of ,>/i-theempress ruling over the empire of kr.owledge ardemancipation. This poetic rcpresei tation would bevery helpful in appreciating the exact position of the Nyaya-vaisesika system in the scheme of astila schools of philosophy. 
SECTION V 
SYNCRETISM AND SYNTHESIS 
It has now become usual among modern scholars, when speaking about the historical dtvelopmtnt of tl eVais f ka and N^aya systems, to refer to tlie tendencyto syncretism in these two scho<.K In chapter II, part I of "Inliwi Logic a<id Atomism", Dr. Keith dwells upon what he describes as "the syncretism of the schools" and the "syncretist school". Syncretism, in its strict sense, means the tendency to reconcile andblend two oppooini; and irreconcilable systems, byminimising differences. In this sense, it would be
xxiv A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART i   
correct to speak about syncretism in the Vaisesika andNyaya only with reference to their condition beforetheir redaction into sutras, and even then, with duereservations. It may be said that, in the pre- Buddhi stic age, rationalistic thinking came to have a schis matic split which resulted in two opposing types of rationalistic thought, one linking itself with Vedictradition and the other antagonising it. As already pointed out at page xi-suj>ra, a rapprochement waseffected between these two types of thought; and as aresult of this, the Vaisesika and Nyaya arose in the form of two sister schools. The tendency which led to the first redaction of these two schools in a fraternal relation may be appropriatelydescribed as syncretism. Since their definite emergence as two distinct and allied systems about the fourth century B. C. to this day, the Vaises; ka and Nyaya have been treated as sister schools, fundamentally agreeing with each other in respect of important metaphysical and logical doctrines and persistently showing some comparatively minordifferences; and in this condition, they were never regarded as opposing schools and it would not be quite accurate to speak of syncretism in them, in the strict sense of the term. In the somewhat larger sense, however, of synthesis, one may well speak of syncretism in these two sister schools from and after their first redaction. In the history of the Nyaya Vaisesika system,the Vaisesika and Nyaya schools were never regarded as rival schools. Nor were their differences ever forgotten: and till recently, separate Nyaya and Vaisesika treatises continued to be written.SEC.V] INTRODUCTION xxv  
In fact, even as late as in the seventeenth century A. D., separate handbooks dealing with the Vaisesika doctrines, like Gangadharasuri's Kanadasiddhanta candrikd (Trivandrum Sanskrit Series No. XXV),were written. It should be remembered here that Aksipjada-Gautama,effected the momentous synthesis between the inductive (Vaisesika) and deductive (i^jydya) types of rationalistic thinking, in his doctrine of five-membered syllogistic expression (nydyaprayoga)hinging upon the example (udaharana) as the central member. The Nyaya ontologyis built upon the atomictheory and pluralistic realism of the Vaiseska. TheNyaya epistemology, with its fourfold scheme ofpramdnas is distinctly pro-Vcdic; and in this respect,it shows a sharp contrast with the Vaisesika scheme ofpramdnas which consists of perception and inference and which betraysar.ti-Vedic leanings. Such points of contrast have only led to Vaisesik-i gradually losing its hold and influence. Indian philosophical tradition recognises three important pairs of allied systems (samanatantrani) viz., the Samkhya and Yoga, the Vaisesika and Nyaya, and the Mnndmsd and Vedanta.Vatsyayana, in his bhasya on the Nyaya- sutra (1.1.22), speaks of the Vaisesika and the JMydya assanianatantra. It is noteworthy that, while the Sdmkhya and Yoga,<ind the Mimdmsd and Vedanla grew as two pairs ofallied systems, the Vaisesika and Nydya came to bemore closely knit together and grew as twin systems, chiefly as a result of the complete synthesis which the Nyaya effected in its logical method.
SECTION VI   
AFTER THE SUTRAS TO UDAYANA 
The extant early works, forming the bas'c source books of the Vaisesika system, are Kanada's sutras and Prasastapa<la's Padarthadharwasamgraho, better known under the name of Prasastapadabhasya. Accord to Udayanacarya's Kirunatall, as interpreted byPadmanabhamiSra in his Kiran&valibhaskora (BenaresSmskrit Series, Ktraufa'all, page 5), Prasastapatla's Paddrthadharmasomgraha is a comprehensive epiu meof the Vais ska system which presupposesan extensive V.-iiSesikn-hlK's. ;i. known as Ravana-bhasya and attri buted to an ancient philosopl er called Ravana. Atpage 2/8 of the manuscriptof the commentary called the Prakatarthaviuarana on gimkaru's Brahmasutia bha$ya% pre>erved in the Government Oriental Marus cripts Library, Madras, Ravana's bhSsyaon the Vai'e sika-sutras is cited. (See p. 491 of Pt. of the edition of this work in the Madras University Sanskrit Series). Prakatarthavivarana \* earlier than 13th century A. D.An interesting confirmation of the tradition aboutRavonn-bhasyd is contained in the vislambha to the fifth Act of the Anatgharaghava (Nirnayasagaraedition, page 161 ). There is evidence to show that this drama must be earlier than the Litter part of the ninth century A. D. In this connection, attention is invited to my paper on the Ravwa-bhosya,which appears in volume III of the Journalof Oriental Reseaicn, Madras, pages1 to 5. In this paper, it is indicated that it may not be unreasonable to conjecture
SEC. vi] INTRODUCTION xxvii   
that the Ravana-bhdsya was perhaps dominated byatheistic and pro-Buddhistic proclivities, such as werequite in keeping with the text of the Vaistsika-sutras and with the spirit of the tradition characterising the Vaisesikas as ardhai ainasi kas (semi-nihilists), whilethe yirork of Prasastapada gave a theistic turn to the Vaisesika system and presented its doctrines in an anti Buddhistic dstika setting. There is conclusive proofto show that Prasastapada should be earlier than LJddyotakara, the author of tbe NyCiyavartika, whoflourished in the latter part of the sixth or the begin ning of the seventh century A. D. Professor Ui, in his introduction to the 'Vaiscsika Philosophy', draws atten tion to the evidences showing that Prasastapada should be earlier than P,iramartha and Dharmauala. 1 houghKeith emphatically asserts in his 'Indian Logic andAtomism9that Prasastapada's indebtedness to Dignagais undoubted, it must be said that Prasastajada's debt to Dignaga has not yet been proved. If, on the other hand, Prasastapada could be taken to be presupposedby Vatsyayana on the ground relied upon by Mr. Bodasin his introduction to the Tar'.asuh^jial^a (BombaySamkrit series, No. LV.), Dignaga, who presupposesVatsyayana, must be later than Prasastapada. Thetwo most authoritative commentaries on Prasasta pada's Bhasya are Sridhara's Kandnli and Uda>ana~carya's Kiranavall Sridhara's date is givui as 991 A. D. in his Kandall and Udayana^ date is given as 984 A. D. in one of his works Laksandvali. Sri dhara's reputation is restricted to his Vaiseika work ;
xxviii A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART i   
but Udayana holds a far higher placein Indian philo sophy and he is held in high esteem as the Nyayacaryapar excellence. 
The extant basic works of Nyaya are Gautama'sNyaya- sutras, the Nyaya-bhasya by Vatsyayana, other wise known as Pakilasvamin, and the Nyaya-vartikaby Uddyotakara.In the Nyaya-vartika and other works, there is sufficient evidence to show conclusively that Dignaga, th$ famous Buddhistic logician, adverse ly criticised the Nyaya-bhasya. Vasubandhu, the famous teacher of Dignaga, criticised Nyaya-sutrasand the Nyaya-bhasya does not reply to Vasubandhu'scriticisms. From these facts, it would be reasonable to conclude that the Nyaya-bhaya is earlier than aboutthe middle of the fourth century A. D., which is the date for Vasubandhu. Vatsyayana suggests alternative interpretations to some of the sutras, as, for instance, in his Bliasya on 1.1.5. This may lead to the inference that Vatsyayana wrote his Bhasya, long after the Sutrakara, perhaps at a time when the meaning of someof the sutras had already become a matter for specu lation. There has been some controversy among scho lars as to whether there was any commentary on the Nyya-sutras before Vatsyayana, and whether the aphoristic statements, which the Bhasyakara introduces in the course of his exposition, are really quotations from some earlier commentary on the sutras. Professor Windisch and several others are inclined to think that such aphoristic statements are citations from an earlier commentary. Professor Handle discusses this question in his recent work "Indian Logic in the Early Schools"
SEC. vi] INTRODUCTION xxix   
(pages 19 to 24) and concludes that these aphoristic statements are not citations from any author but should be viewed as forming"the heritage of the schcol and as carrying an authority onlyless than that of the 
sutras themselves''. Indian tradition, however, is wholly against any speculation of this kind in regardto to the aphoristic statements in the Bhasya above re ferred to. In Sastra literature, more especiallyin old works like the Bhasyas on the various systems,it is a common stylistic device to put forward a main thesis or argument in the form of a terse aphoristic statement and amplify it in an expositorynote. Several old Bhayakaras have adopted this device and hundreds of instances can be given from the Mahabhasyaot Patan jali and Sankara's Bhasyas on the Brhadaranyakopani 
ad and the Brahma-sutras. In fact, the aphoristic statements which Vatsyayana makes at the beginningof his expository sections form integral parts of Vatsya yana's own composition; and it would be as absurd to ascribe such statements to any author different fromVatsyayana, as it would be to ascribe the aphoristic statement, "Since there is no difference from cattle andother lower animals" in Sankara's Bhasya on the Brahma-sutras (pavQdiI>hiscavise$at-\.l.l)to someauthor different from the BhasyakSra, who amplified that statement in the following expository paragraphbeginning with the words "yatha hi paSvadayah".Students of Indian logic will do well to remember that Vatsyayana is the earliest known writer who drewpointed attention to the reason why Gautama's JNyayacame to be regardedas the science of epistemology
xxx A PRIMER OF TND AN LOGIC [PART i   
and logic (Pramanasastra, Anviksikior Nyaya-sastra). It is worth remembering, in this connection, that Vatsyayana indicates in the very first sentence of his Bhasyahow valid thinking (/rawd) and fruitful doing (arthakriya) serve as each other's axle in each other's 
wheelings and how they constitute real living with all its complexity in the pluralistic universe of the Nja ya-Vaisesika realism. It is also worth noting that it is Vatsyayana who first explained how the entire epi^temo logical scheme of Pramanas could be synthesised in a valid syllogistic expression, (vide pages 30 to 42 of his Bhasya on 1.1.1, Chaukhamba edition) and how, for this reason, logic proper justly came to exercise a pro found influence over the whole realm of philosophical thought in India. 
About the end of the sixth century A.D., or in the former half of the seventh century, Uddyotak<ira wrote his Nyaya-v&rtika, the earliest extant commentary onthe Nyaya-bhasya. Some scholars like Dr. Keith maintain that UJdyotakara was a contemporary of the Buddhistic logician Dharmakirii. Hiuen-t^ang (629- 645 A. D.) does not speak of Dharmakirti, while I-tsing (671-695 A. D.) refers to him. The reference in the Nyaya-vartika to a Vada-vidhi (page 117, line 21, Chaukhamba, edition)is the only argument relied uponfor showing that Uddyotakara is not earlier than Dhar makirti. Tnis argument assumes that Dharmakirti is the author of the Vada-vidhi. Sufficient evidence has not been adduced in support of the view that the Vada vidhi is one of Dharmakirti's works. Chinese tradition definitely lends support to the identification of the
SEC. vi] INTRODUCTION xxxi   
Vada-vidhi with one of Vasubandhu's works. Further, in the Vartika on 1.1.4, Dignaga's definition of percep tion is criticised; and it is generally accepted by Brah manical and Buddhistic authorities alike that Dharma kirti was responsible for the introduction of the addi tional word abhranta in that definition, chiefly with a view to meeting the objections raised by Uddyotakara against it. These considerations tend to show that it would be reasonable to assign Uddyotakara to the end of the sixth or the beginning of the seventh century A. D. and to assign Dharmaklrti to about the third quarter of the seventh century A. D. Uddyotakara's great service to Nyaya consists in his successful en deavour to lift it up from the slough into which it wasthrown by Dignaga's confutation of Vatsyayana's Bhasya. After Uddyotakara, the philosophical contest between the anti-Vedic and pro-Vedic sides of the Nyaya thought was keenly carried on by great Buddhistic logicianslike Dharmaklrti, Dharmottaraarid Ratnakirti and eminent Brahmanical logicians like VacaspatimJsra, Jayantabhatta, Bhasarvajna andUdayana. Vacaspati has himself given 841 A. D. as the date of the composition of his index to Gautama'ssutras, called Nydya-suci-nibandha. Vacaspati is famous for his polymathic learning and dispassionate philosophical outlook. He is the author of many im portant and authoritative treatises, mainly in the nature of expository and critical commentaries, on almost all the systems of Indian philosophy. His Brahmatattva samlksd on Mandanamisra's Brahmasiddhi andBh&mati on Sankara's Brahmasutra-bhaya represent
xxxii A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PARTI  
the Advaita system; his Sdmkhya-tattvakaumudi andYoga-bhGfya-vati&radl represent the Samkhya-Yogasystem; and his Ny&ya-stici-nibandha and Nyaya v&rtiktht&tparya-fika represent the Nyaya system* There is evidence to show that Bh&matl should have been his latest work. In his Nydya-vartika-tatparya fikft, he renders intelligible the difficult portions of the Nyaya-vartika and incidentally discusses several obs cure portions of the Nyaya-bha?ya and the Nyaya sutras, in accordance with the Nyaya tradition banded down to him by his Nyaya teacher Trilocana. Forthe monumental contribution which he made to Nyayain his T&tparya-fikfi, he came to be known as the Tatparyacarya in Nyaya literature. He justly claims, in his Tatparya-fika> special credit for having re deemed from oblivion Uddyotakara's work, which came to be regarded very old and nearly forgotten in the ninth century A. D. Jayantabhatta, who presup poses Vacaspati in his work and refers to Ananda vardhana's Dhvany&loka (Vide page 48 lines 21 to 25, Ny'ayamaiijari, Benares), should be taken to be later than the middle of the ninth century A.D. ; and with the help of the particulars furnished by Jayanta's son, Abhinanda, in the Kadambarikath&sara, Jayanta may be assigned to the third quarter of the ninth cen tury A. D. Jayanta's chief contribution to Nyaya is his Ny&yamanjart. This work is of the nature of an elaborate vjtti (expository gloss) on select sutras of Gautama. Jayanta himself says that the Nyayo-man~/on was so well appreciated by his contemporaries that he came to be recognisedas the Vrtti-kara of Nyaya.
SEC. vi] INTRODUCTION xxxiii   
Bhasarvajna, who flourished perhaps about the begin ning of the tenth century A.D., is the author of an im portant Nyaya work called Nyaya-sdra; and the dis tinctive feature of this work is its epistemology whichdeviates in certain respects from established Nyayatradition, as for instance, in discarding upamdna as adistinct Pramana and in recognising six hetv&bh&sasincluding anadhyavasita. Udyanacarya is the greatest Naiyayika of the tenth century A.D. At the end ofone of his works, Laksanavali, he has given 984 A.D.as the date of its composition. Besides his erudite commentaries on Prasastapada's Bhaya and Vacas pati's Tatparya-tlk& Kirandvali and Tatparya-pari sitddhi, he wrote three important Nyaya works the Prabodhasiddhi, otherwise called Ny&yaparisista, the Atma-tattva-vivtka, otherwise called Bauddha dhikkQra and the Nyaya-kusum&njati. The first ofthese three works contains an elucidative and illustra tive exposition of the subtleties of /<Ut (futile respon dence) and nigrahasthana (vulnerable points)in ac cordance with the dialectics of early Nyaya. TheAtma-tattva-viveka is a brilliant exposition of the Nyaya metaphysics with particular reference to the Nyaya conception of the self (jlva) and contains aforcible refutation of the Buddhistic doctrines ofmomentariness (ksana-bhanga) and voidness (sunyt a). The Kttsumanjali is Udayana's masterpiece. It is devoted to a refutation of the anti-theistic theories maintained by the Vedistic, Samkhya, nihilistic andnaturalistic schools of his age and to the amplification and vindication of the Nyaya theism, chiefly on theC
xxxiv A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART i   
basis of the creationistic view of causation. Udayana'sthcistic argument consists of two main parts: one part arguing towards values, design and causation in the sense of creation and the other part arguing to Godfrom values, design and creation. His monumentalcontribution to Indian theism has secured for him the high rank of Nyaydc&rya. From the references given on page 21 of the Sanskrit introduction to the Kaudall(Vizianagaram Sanskrit Series),it may be safely con cluded that Udayana was a contemporary of Sridhara. 
SECTION VII 
AFTER UDAYANA TO ANNAMBIIATTA 
Sivadityamisra's Safrtapadarthl is a short and sim ple manual setting forth the essentials of the Vaiseikasystem chiefly in accordance with Prasastapada's Bhasya. It also makes use of the Nyaya material in Bhasarvajna's Nydya-sara, to some extent. Sivaditya's text giving his scheme of six fallacious types of probans with anadhyavasita corresponding to asadhti rana (uncommon probans) as a distinct type, is practi cally a reproduction of the corresponding text of Bhasarvajna. (Compare page 23, Saptapadarthl Viztanagaram Sanskrit Series, with page 25 in the Nyayasfira Poona Oriental Book Agency). Acareful comparisonof Sivaditya's Saptapadarthl with Udayana's Kiranavall would lead one to believe that the Saptapadarthl utilised the material in the Kiranavall. For instance, the definition of dark ness on page 71 of Saptapadarthl appears to presupposeSEC. vii] INTRODUCTION   
Udayana's remarks about darkness on pages111 and112 of the Kiranavall (Bibliotheca Indica) ; the defini tion of /a/I* on page 70 of the Saptapadarthl appearsto presuppose Udayana's enumeration of jdtib&dhdkas onpage 161 of the Kiranavall and the definition of laksana (definition) found on page 192 of the Kiran&valt is reproduced on page 35 of the Saptapadarthl. Sriharsa, the autlior of the Khandatiakhandakhddya, andGangesa, the author of the l^attvacintamani, undoubt edly refer to Sivaditya. (Videintroduction to the Saptapadarthl page 2.) On these grounds,it wouldnot be unreasonable to assign the Saptapadarthlto the eleventh century A. D. (circa). The importance of the Saptapadarthl lies in the fact that later writers like Annambhatta used it as their model for their primers of Nyaya, as may be unmistakably made out from the close correspondence between several portions in the Saptapadarihl and primers like the Tarka 
sanigraha. 
The greatest Nyaya work, which was written after Udayana, is the Tattvacintdwaniby GangeSopadhyaya.In this monumental work, Gangesa utilised all the con structive, expositary, critical and polemical material in the earlier works on Nyaya and Vaiseika and gave the final shape and turn to the logic and metaphysics of Nyaya. In treating the various topics of Nyaya, the earlier writers usually adopted the categoristic method, which was inaugurated by Gautama. This method as expounded by Vatsyayana, consists in enumeration andclassification (uddeta and vibhaga), definition (laksana} t careful investigation and discussion (fiariksti). Varada-
xxxvi A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART r   
raja's Tarkikaraksa (1100 A. D. circa) is the latest im portant work on Nyaya, which adopts the old catego ristic method in accordance with the Nyaya-sutras andBhaya. It was Gangesa who replaced this old methodby what may be described as the epistemological methodor the fyramana method, which definitely shifted the emphasis from the categoristic treatment of the topics (padarthah} of Nyaya to the epistemological treat ment of the four means of valid cognition (praManam)recognised by the Naiyayikas. Thus, the Nyaya-sastrawhich had remained hitherto a mere pad&rtha-sastray for all practical purposes, was turned into a full-fledged pramana-fastrain Gangesa's Tattvacintamani; and in this partly lies the epoch-making character of this monumental work on Nyaya. That the Tattvacintamaniserves as the basic work on which the whole literature of what is commonly known as toavya-nyaya (modernN>aya) rests is also another reason for regarding it as an epoch-making work. The Tattvaciniamani, or the Mani as it is popularly known, consists of four maindivisions represented by the four chapters (khanda) onperception ($ratyak$a), inference (anumana}, assimi lation in the sense of analogising (upam&na), andverbal testimony (sabda). In the course of an elabo rate elucidation and discussion of the nature and ob jective reach and content of these four Pramanas, the relevant topics of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system are con sidered in the Mani in comparison with the kindred topics of other philosophical systems. The languageof Gangesa's Mani is also of an epoch-making type. Such of the modern students of Nyaya literature as are
SEC. vn] INTRODUCTION xxxvii   
not equipped with the required control over the termi nology of navya-riyaya are apt to indulgein the ill conceived criticism that the language of the Mani andthe connected works is spoiled by a huge over-growth of inflated and hair-splitting logic-chopping. The key to navya-nyaya is its terminology. Those who havecontrolled this terminology are sure to find in the Maniand allied works a discipline of unique subtlety andvalue. The history of philosophical thought showsthat lack of precision in expression seriously hampersits progress. In Indian thought, this defect was sought to be remedied by Naiyayikas like Gangesopadhyayathrough several thought-measuring devices, whichchiefly consisted of formulas in Sanskrit constructed with the aid of terms like avacchedaka (the delimiter),. avacchedya (the delimited), nirapaka (co-forming), nirupya (co-formed), anuyogin (containing correlate) and pratiyogin (the other correlate or counter-corre late). All the Indian dialecticians, who wrote after Gangesopadhyaya, were influenced by the thought measuring formulas used by Gangesa. By using sucfr formulas, it was possible for later dialectics in Indian philosophical literature to achieve a remarkable degreeof quantitative precision in measuring iht* extent (temporal and spatial), content and intent (purpose and potency) of cognition (jnana). 
Gan gesa quotes Sriharsa (the Khandanakard)and refutes his view (page 233 of the Mani anu mdna, Bibliotheca Indica). There is sufficient evidence in favour of assigning Sriharsa to 1136 A. D. circa. Pakadharamisra, otherwise known as Jayadeva, wrote
xxxviii , A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART*   
a commentary called Aloka on the Mani. This Jaya deva is believed to be identical with Jayadeva, the author of the Prasatonaraghava. A verse from this drama (kadali kadall etc., I. 37) is quoted in the Sahityadarpana, as pointed out by Mr. P. V. Kane in his introduction to the latter work. Thus Paksadhara misra, alias Jayadeva, must have been considerably earlier than the Sahityadarpana (1300 A. D. circa). These facts will show that it would not be reasonable to assign Gangesa to any date much earlier than 1200A. D. and that he may be assignedto the former half of the thirteenth century A.D. 
Vardhamanopadhyaya, the only son of Gangesaaccording to tradition, was also a reputed Naiyayika ofthis period. He wrote several learned and illuminating works, generally known as Prakasa, in the form of commentaries on Udayana's treatises, Gangesa's Maniand Vallabhacarya's Nyayalilavatl. Jayadeva's pupil, Rucidatta, was a logician of considerable repute andwas the author of a well-known commentary called Makaranda on Vardhamana's P 
rakasa.

The end of the fifteenth century, as also the six teenth and seventeenth centuries, may well be described as marking tfie heyday of Nyaya dialectics in Nuddea{Navadvlpa, Bengal). Vasudeva Sarvabhauma wasthe greatest Naiyayika who flourished about the end ofthe 15th and the earlier part of the 16th century. Hehad the unique privilege and glory of having taught Nyaya to four of the greatest personalities of the 16th century: v%z, Caitanya, the greatest Vaisnava teacher

and reformer of Bengal in the 16th centujry; natha, otherwise known as Tarkika-siromani (th$crest jewel of all logicians); Raghunandana, a fstfitous Bengal lawyer ; and Krsnananda, a reputed tantrika, who was a great authority on the different forms andcharms of the Sakta cult. Raghunatha (Tarkika-siro mani) was admittedly the greatest logician of the six teenth century. He wrote several treatises on Nyaya,mostly in the form of commentaries and the greatest and the most famous of the works is the Didhiti, an expository and critical commentary on Gangesa's Mani.Mathuranatha was the most famous of Raghunatha siromani's pupils and wrote authoritative commentarieson the Mani and the Didhiti. Jagadisa and Gadadharawere the greatest exponents of navya-nydya as re presented by the Mani and the Didhiti, and flourished in the earlier part of the seventeeth century. Jagadisa is famous as the author of the commentary on the Didhiti, popularly known as J&gadlsl, the Sabdasakti prakdsika an independent treatise on the speculative Semantics of Nyaya, a short manual called the Tarka mrla and a commentary called the Bhdsya-sukti onthe Bhasya of Prasastapada. Gadadhara is famous as the author of the commentary, popularly known as the Gddddhari, on the Didhiii, the commentary called the Mulagddddhan on portions of the Mani, commentarieson Udayana's Atmatattvavivcka, and fifty-two dialectic tracts and treatises such as the Vyufyattivada andand Saktivada (dialectic treatises on the speculative Semantics of Nyaya). The more important works ofJagadis.a and Gadadhara are still studied carefully by
XL A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PARTr   
those students who seek to specialisein navya-nydyaand they are regarded as constituting an indispensable discipline of high value to every scholar who wishes to be recognised as a sound sdstrin. The dialectic litera ture of later Nyaya is a vast banyan tree, which had its roots struck deep and its huge trunk fully developedin Mithila in the Tattvacintumani, had its immensebranches and foliage stretched out and ramified in the Didhiti in Nuddea, and bore fruit in the rich fruitage of Jdgadlsl and Gadddhari, which formed the colossal monument of Indian dialectics in the seventeenth century. If Tvajjlmnfiiha is regarded as the crest-jewel (siromani) of logical dialecticians, Gadadhara may well be characterised as the prince of Nuddea dialecticians, who wears the diadem inlaid with this brilliant crest 
jewel. 
In the latter pa;rt of the seventeenth century,the NyHya scholars interested themselves chieflyin the interpretation of the earlier and later works on Nyayaand in the production of introductory hand-books.Three of such scholars may be mentioned here Sam kara-misra, Visvanatha-paficanana and Annambhatta,Samkara-misra wrote a commentary on the Jdgadlsi anda comprehensive commentary called the IJpaskdra oi> Kanada's sutras. Visvanatha-paficanana wrote a com mentary on the Nyaya-sutras in 1634; and he is famous as the author of the popular hand-book of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, called the Bhasdpariccheda or Karikftvall, which consists of 168 easy verses. TheKdrikdvall is accompanied by the author's own com mentary called the Nyayasiddhantamuktavali. Accord-

ing to the traditional methods of study, the MuktQvaliis widely studied by students of Nyaya, immediatelyafter finishing the study of Annambhatta's Tarkasatii graha and Dlpika. 
Annambhatta was an Andhra scholar whoflourished in the latter part of the seventeenth century. He was a versatile scholar and a reputed polymath. He wrote several learned works on almost all the im portant branches of Sastraic lc;i ruing. In this connec tion, attention may be invited to some of Annam bhatta's known works. In the sphere of Purva mimarhsa and Vedanta, he is known as the author of the massive commentary called the Ranakojjlvam on Bhatta Somesvara's Nyaya-sudha, otherwise known as Ranaka, and of a commentary on the Brahma-sutras. In Vyakarana, he is famous as the author of an easy commentary on Panini's Astadhydyi and of an exten sive commentary called Uddyoiatoa on Kaiyata's Pradlpa. In the sphere of the Nyaya-Vaisesikasystem, he wrote a learned commentary called Sid dhanjana on Jayadeva's Manyaloka, as also the mostpopular handbook of Indian logic called the Tarka samgraha and its expository and supplementary gloss called the Dipika. The name Tarkasamgraha is inter preted by Annambhatta himself as a compendiouselucidation of the nature of substance, qualities andsuch other ontological categories of the Vaisesika sys tem, which are accepted by Nyaya. These two works
the Tarkasamgraha and the Dlpika fulfil the object mentioned in the concluding verse of the Tarka

CHAPTER I   
PERCEPTION 
1 
T In my heart, I devoutly 
cherish the Lord of the universe; 
my teacher, I respectfully greet; 
and I proceed to write this 
Primer of Indian Logic, called 
Tarka-Samgraha, with a view
to beginners gaining knowledge
easily. 
Following the time-honoured practice of orthodox: Sanskrit writers, Annambhatta begins his Primer witlir an appropriate mangold, which consists, here, in paying devout homage to his God and to his teacher. Theexpression Visvesa the Lord of the universe is sug gestive of the central argument of the Nyaya theism the creationistic argument. The four preambularyfactors, constituting what is known as anubandha*catustaya, are also indicated in the second line of the introductory verse. They are subject-matter (vifayaj,. the chief aim (prayojana),relation (sambandha) and; the persons for whom the work is specially designed1 (adhikarin). Such preambulary details are usually incorporated in modern books in a separate prefaceprefixed to the work in question, while they are briefly set forth in the opening verses in sastra treatises in? Sanskrit. The elements of the Nyaya-VaiSesika system
4 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
in its syncretist form constitute the subject-matter ofthis Primer and its aim is to enable beginners to understand them easily.It follows from this that this Primer is intended for the beginners. Pratifadya pratipadaka-bhava the relation of treated and treatise 
is generally stated to form thesambandha in almostall sastra works. This would be useless information, when understood literally.It would acquire special significance if it should be interpreted as holding out an assurance, that the author can be trusted to treat well in his treatise, the subjectin hand. 
The name Tarka-samgraha is interpreted byAnnambhatta himself as a compendious elucidation of the nature of substance, qualities and such other onto logical categories of the Vaisesika system, that are accepted by Nyaya. The term tarka is thus taken bythe author in a somewhat unusual sense. The usual meanings, however, of the word tarka are logic, reason ing, reductio ad absurdum and discussion. Putting all these ideas together, it would be easy to see how the title Tarka-samgraha may be taken to be equivalent to A Primer of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system in its syn cretist form*. 
2 
T Substance, quality, ac 
tivity, generality, particularity, 
inherence and non-existence are 
the seven categories (pad&rth&h) 9 
A paddrtha is literally a nameable or denotable thing or a fhing which corresponds to a word. Kanada,CH. i] PERCEPTION 5   
in his Vaisesika-sutras, givesthe name artha to sub stance (dravya), quality (guna)and activity (karma).Prasastapada, the author of the Vaisesika-bhayacalled Padartha-dharma-saihgraha enumerates the first six paddrthas out of the seven mentioned above. LaterVaisesikas add non-existence (abhdra)to Prasasta pada' s list of six paddrthas. Gautama, the author ofthe Nyaya Sutras, Vatsyayana, the author of Nyaya bhiisya and later Naiyayikas: ov'opiNr all these seven 
paddrthas. 
What is a paddrtha or category as understood in the above text 2. T.? A paddrtha is usually defined as a knowable thing (jneya)or as a validly cognisable thing (pravicya),or as a nameable or denotable thing (abhidheya). The Nyaya-Vaisesika system maintainsthat its scheme of seven padarthas represents a satis factory classification of all the knowable or nameablethings. The first six are called bhdva-faddrthas orexistent entities and are thus contrasted, in a markedway, with abhava, which amounts to non-existence. Though Kanada speaks of abhava, he does not include it in his list of arthas for the reason that he under stands by artha an entityin which existence or satta, in the Vaisesika sense, inheres. Prasastapada does not mention abkava in his scheme of six padfirthas, since this scheme confines itself to bhavas. But a complete scheme of all the knowable or validly cognisable or nameable things must not omit abhava for it is main tained in the Nyaya-Vaisesika system that we knowabhava, know it correctly and the negative terms in language denote it.
6 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
It would be useful to compare in this connection the above scheme of seven paddrthas with Gautama'sscheme of sixteen pad&rthas and with the correspond ing schemes adopted in certain other systems of Indian philosophy. In the first Sutra of the Nyaya-darsana, 'Gautama enumerates sixteen paddrthas means oi valid 'knowledge (pramana), objects of valid krtowledge i(prameya), doubt (samsaya), purpose (prayoj ana) , instances (drstdnta), established conclusions (sid dhanta), members of syllogism (avayava),reduciio ad<tbsurdum (tarka), decisive knowledge (nirnaya), argu iing for truth (vada), arguing constructively as well as destructively for victory (jalpa), merely destructive .argument (vitandd), fallacious reasons (hetvabhasa), quibbling (chala), specious and unavailing objections 
(jati), and vulnerable points (nigrahasthana). Thesesixteen are not metaphysical categories similar to those of the Vaibeikas; but they are merely sixteen topics which one should study in order to master the details of the Nyaya dialectics. The Mimamsakas of the Bhatta school recognise five paddrthas substance, generality, quality, activity and non-existence. The Prabhakaras recognise eight the five bhavas of the Nyaya-system
(omitting visesa) and potency (sakti), similarity '(sadrfya) and number (saiikhya), non-existence not being accepted as a distinct category. The Sariikhyas accept 
twoultimate padarthas \ primordial matter (prakrti) andspirit (purusa). Among the Vedantins, the Advaitins maintain that there is one ultimate reality Brahmanand there are only two padarthas spirit (cit) andnon-spirit (acit), or soul (atman) and non-soul
CH. i] PERCEPTION 7  
(andtman) ; the Visitadvaita school recognises three spirit (cit), non-spirit (acit), and God (Isvara); andthe Dvaitins reduce all the padarthas to two main cate gories independent and dependent. Among the older Vaisesikas, we find some, like the author of the Data paddrt'ha-sa>strat who would recogniseten pad&rthas in all the six bhdvas of the later Vaisesikas, poten tiality (sakti), inability (a-sakti), genericdifferentia (sdmdnya-visesa) and non-existence (abhdva). ExceptGautama's list of sixteen padarthas, all these schemes of categories attempt, with a large measure of success, at a sound metaphysical classification of all nameableor knowable things; and none of these Indian schemes can justly be said to exhibit the logical defects that wenotice in similar schemes of categories known to Western logic such as the somewhat arbitrary schemeof ten categories or predicates given by Aristotle, andthe schemes of four or three or seven categories put forward by the Stoics, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke* Mill and other philosophers. 
In most of the syncretist works dealing with the tenets of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, the argumentsadvanced by the Bhattas as well as the Prabhakaras to establish the existence of potentiality (sakti) asa distinct entity (quality or category) and the view upheld by the latter school of MImamsakas that similarity (sddrsya) should be given a distinct placein the list of categories are refuted. Counter-agents (pratibandhaka) counteract the operation of causes and causes turn out to be un availing. The counteraction that we experience in such
8 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART ra   
cases cannot be explained otherwise than as consisting in the destruction of the causal efficacy or sakti of the causes. Thus according to Mimarhsakas, the existence 
of sakti as a distinct category must necessarily be re cognised. The Naiyayikas argue that counteraction consists merely in the presence of counter-agents,the total non-existence of which is one of the ^elements constituting the full compliment of the causal apparatus (sSmagrl) . Thus they disprove the necessity for re cognising sakti as a distinct category. Similarity, ac cording to Prabhakaras, does not consist merelyin the possession of parts or qualities or features of the samekind as the Naiyayikas urge; but it is revealed inex perience as a distinct category. The Naiyayikas contend that a careful analysis of experience would show that similarity consists merely in the possession of parts orqualities or features of the same kind. 
3 (a) 
T Of them (the seven cate 
gories), the Substances are only 
nine vis.: earth, water, light, 
air, ether, time, space, soul and
mind. 
The word 'only*in this text is intended to exclude'darkness', which according to Mimarhsakas, is a dis tinct substance. The Mimarhsakas argue that on the strength of the experience which associates blue colour and movement with darkness, it should be regarded as a substance; and it cannot be any of the nine substances mentioned above. So, it should be given a distinct
OH. i] PERCEPTION 9   
place as the tenth substance in the list of substances. The Naiyayikas point out that the experience whichassociates colour and movement with darkness is erro neous. For, a substance having colour can be seen only in the presence of light; and darkness, which is seen in the absence of light, cannot be a substance havingcolour. In fact, darkness, according to Naiyayikas, is nothing but the total absence of such light as is effec tual in normal perception. 
In the text under consideration, substances are divided into nine classes. This may be taken to be a definition of substances from the point of view of ex tension. But the Nyaya method of exposition, according to Vatsyayana (Nyaya-Bhfisxn 1-2-3, Avatarika) recognises that expository scheme to be perfect whichconsists of uddcsa (enumeration accompanied byvibhaga or division), laksana (definition) and pariksa (investigation). Thus a mere enumeration or division of substances will not do and they should be defined. A substance is usually defined as that which possesses the jati (generic attribute)called dravyatva (sub stance-ness) ;or as that in which a quality (guna)or activity (kriya) inheres; or that which is fit to be treated as the inherent cause (samavtiyi-karana)of some effect. Of these alternatives, the second and third, based on quality and activity, are not applicable to substances in the first moments of their creation ; for, according to the Naiyayika theory of causation^ every cause should necessarily precede its effect, andqualities and activities, which are the effects of sub-

stances, require at least one moment before they could come into being. If the function of definition should be to provide a valid reason (hetu)for inferring differ ence from others and if inference should be of some thing which is not already comprisedin the connota tion of the minor term (paksa),substance-ness (dra vyatva), which is connoted by the term dravya, wouldnot form a satisfactorydefinition. In such circum stances, by using quality or activity and without directly using dravyatva, a substance is defined as a thing possessing a jdti (generic attribute), which is not satta (existence) and is co-existent with a quality or activity. This kind of ingenious device, which is com monly adopted by the Naiyayikas,is known as jdti ghaMa-laksana. 
In this connection, it would be of advantageto elucidate briefly the Naiyayika's view of definitions and their functions. A definition in Nyaya is not merely an explication of the connotation of a term; but it is a proposition specifyingthe differentia or the differentiating feature of the species or the thing defined. A laksana is a specific feature or asddhararia dharm a. The term asadhdrana means that which is free from the three faults of a definition vis: over applicability ( ativyapti) , partial inapplicability (avyapti) and total inapplicability (asambhava). Adefinition, that is too wide and that consists of anattribute which is presentin things soughtto be defined as well as those not intended to be defined, has the defect of atwy&pt'i; while a definition which does not
CH. i] PERCEPTION II   
apply to some of the thingsdefined has the defect of cvydpti' and one which is wholly inapplicableto any of the things defined has the defect of asambhava. Sucha specific feature (asadharanadharma)is reciprocally co-extensive with the adjunct that delimits the scope of laksyald (being sought to be defined);in other words, wherever that feature is, laksyatavacchedakaor the delimiting adjunct of laksyata is, and wherever the latter is, the former is. In the case of a cow or an ox(gauh), for instance, gotva or bovineness is the laks yatavacthedaka, when all the quadrupedsof the bovine species, and none else, are sought to be defined. In this case, brown colour or uncloven hoof would be too narrow to constitute a definition, the former, which is applicable only to some of the laksyas, being vitiated bythe fault of avyapti (partial inapplicability), and the latter, which is applicable to none of them, beingvitia ted by asambhava (total inapplicability), while havinghorns would be too wide and therefore vitiated by the fault of ativtyapti. It will be seen, from this, that the Nyaya view of the function of a definition is primarily, differentiation, and incidentally, designation also, while the latter is the only conceivable function in certain cases. "Vyavrttir vyavaharo vd laksanasya prayo janam" is an oft-quoted dictum in Nyaya literature. Vydvrttior differentiation consists in the inference of difference from the other things. Smell in the case ofearth or rationalityin the case of a man forms a differentiating laksana and serves as a valid reason leading to the inference of difference from not-earth in the former case, and from not-man in the latter. What
12 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
helps in differentiation also helpsin specific designation. All vy&vartakalaksanas are thus vyavaharikalaksanasalso. In certain cases like nameability (abhidhe yatva), all things (paddrtha)are intended to be covered by the definition ; but no differentiation is possible, as nothing can be said to be other than a thing (padartha) ; and in such cases the only function of laksanq is desig. nation (vyavahara). 
It would be interesting to observe here that lak sanas or definitions are as important on the positive side in the pluralistic realism of the N}aya-Vaiscs'kasystem, as they are on the negative side in the monistic phenomenalism of the Advaita Vcdanta. In the formersystem, laksaiias are helpful in arriving at, and main taining the reality of, several self-contained andmutually exclusive units, which, according to the Advaitic monist are but fragmentary appearances of the one absolute; while, in the latter system, laksanas are but so many unsustainable stunts demonstratingthe futility of the <lir< r< i :i;:'.ii-.. efforts of the fissi parous phase of human intellect and the soundness of the doctrine of indefinability (anirvacamyatu) whichthe Advaitins seek to uphold. 
It may also be useful to remember here that the conception of substance (dravya) as the substratum ofqualities and movements is the bed-rock of the realism of Nyaya; and one has only to show the hollowness of the Nyaya distinctions of substance (dravya), quality (yuna) and movement (karman or kriya),in order to knock off the bottom of the Nyaya realism.

Patanjali, in his Mahabhaya, describes a guna as something which inheres only in a substance, and, under certain circumstances, ceases to be there; which is found in different species of substances but eternal in some cases and non-eternal in other cases. 
"Sattve nivisatc'paili prthagj&tisu vartate Adheyascakriyajasca so9sattva'prakrtirguwah." This is Patanjali'sdefinition of a guna. It is generally, adopted by all the grammarians (Vaiyakaranas) andit amounts to this in plain language: ^ a guna may be eternal or non-eternal and inheres in a substance; but it is neither a substance nor an activity. The Vaiyakara na's conception of a guna, for all practical purposes, is the same as the Naiyayika's conception of it. TheMimamsakas sometimes use the term guna in the sense of a quality and sometimes in the general sense of something that is ancillary and comparatively unimpor tant. The term guna is sometimes used in the sense of literary merit and also in the general sense of a good feature. The Samkhya sense of the word is the com-
14 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
ponent strands of the composite primordial mattercalled prakrti which consists of the three gunas good ness (sattva), passion (rajas) and darkness (tamas). The Vedantins generally use the word guna in the sense of an attribute or dharma. Though the term gunais thus greatly ambiguous in Sanskrit philosophical lite rature, the Naiyayika's technical use of thjs term is sufficiently precise and does not admit of confusion. 
It would be difficult to justify the need for giving a distinct place in the Naiyayika's list of gunas, to prthaktva, vibhtga, paratva and aparatva. Prthaktva
(separateness) is notmaterially different fromdifference which, according to Naiyayikas, is anyonya bhava or reciprocal negation a species of non-exis tence. Vibhaga (disjunction) could hardly be distin guished from Samyogan&Sa (loss of contact). Whatare remoteness and proximity (paratva and aparatva) 
but space-relation or time-relation, the former consist ing in a larger number of intervening samyogas (con tacts) or viprakrstatva and the latter in a smaller number of intervening samyogas or sannikrstatva? In fact, some Navya-Naiyayikas are prepared to discard these gunas, on the grounds indicated. The realistic obsession of the Nyaya-Vai$eika writers, who often go to the length of finding in the external world an objective reality corresponding to every thought andevery word, is mainly responsible for the retention of these qualities in the traditional list of gunas. 
It would be useful to note here that the Nyayasystem draws a distinction between visesa-gunas andCH. i] PERCEPTION 15   
sdmdtoya-gunas. Colour, smell, taste, touch, viscidity, natural fluidity, cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, hatred, effort, irterit, demerit, reminiscent impressions and sound
these are visesa-gunas ; and the rest are sdmdnya gunas. The former are special qualities, as the namevisesa-guna signifies ; and they are special qualitiesin the sense that they are never found to be common to two classes of substances, or to be more accurate, that a visesa-guna, in the specific form in which it is actu ally found, has a j&ti which is not present in anyquality co-existing with two classifying attributes (vibhdjakopadhi) of substances. It is easy to see howthe rest are sdmdnya-gunas or general qualities.

T Activity or motion is of
five kinds: upward motion, 
downward motion, contraction, 
expansion and going or move 
ment from one place to another. 
KanSda's traditional classification of karma(activity) is here followed, though the classification is unsatisfactory, as pointed out by Nilakantha in his PrakSsika and by several others. It is obvious that gamana in a broad sense would include all other varieties of activity. In common parlance, karma,kriyd and krti are used as synonyms. In sastraic terminology, krti is equivalent to yaina, which is the inner volitional process immediately and invariably preceding a voluntary activity. In this sense krti should not be confounded with kriyd or karma. The
16 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
Nyaya-Vaisesika system distinguishes between volun tary activity (yatna-purvakakriya or, as it is sometimescalled, cesta) and involuntary activity (a-ydtna-pw vaka-kriya). The term karma used in the sense of 
kriya should be distinguished from the syntactic karma(object); and it should be also differentiated fromkarma, used in the sense of the unseen impression or vestige which every work leaves behind it and whichshadows the doer. It is in this latter sense that the word karma should be understood in phrases like the 'Karma theory* and'prarabdha-karma.* 
According to Vaisesikas and Naiyayikas, the essential feature of every activity is to bring about disjunction (vibhdga),then the destruction of con junction with a previous spot (purvadesasamyoganasa)and lastly conjunction with a further spot (uttaradcsa samyoga). The origin of a kriya occupies one moment
(ksana} ; and the three factors that follow its origin separation, loss of prior contact and further contact occupy each one moment. An activity, thus, fulfils its 
purpose completely in the fourth moment (ksana}, as soon as the further contact (uttaradesasamyoga) arises and comes to an end in the fifth ksana. Every activity lasts only for four ksanas. An important corollary, deducible from these facts is that one karma can never
cause another karma ; for, an activity cannot be said to be caused in the second or third or fourth ksana of aprior activity, the prior contact being destroyed by the disjunction resulting from the prior activity, the later activity having no purpose to serve in the second or
CH. i] PERCEPTION 17   
third or fourth ksana of the prior activity, and the fifth ksana being one in which the prior activity comes to an end and cannot, therefore, be asso ciated with the later activity as its cause. In this con nection, it should be remembered that a kriyd cannotbe conceived of otherwise than as direct and indepen dent cause of disjunction and as leading to further contact, through loss of prior contact; for, according to Kanoda and Gautama, to go to is to forego, or, in other words, to quit, to sunder and touch further on. (Kriyd, tato vibhdgah, tatah purradesasawyoganatah,tatah uttaradefa-sathyogah, tatah kriytinasah).It mayalso be noted here that the Vaisesikas and Nai>ayikasuse any one of these five factors, from the origin of kriyd down to its cessation, as the delimiting condition (upddhi) of a ksana, which is regarded as the smallest unit of time. 
The Nyaya-Vaisesika conception of kriyd stands in sharp contrast with the Vaiyakarana view of this category. According to the Vaiyakaranas a kriyd is what is usually denoted by a verbal root (dhdtu) andit is ordinarily a process consisting of many activities (vydpdrah") arising in succession. In its fully accom plished state (siddhdvasthd),a kriyd is denoted by a substantive like pdka; and when it is being done or in its sddhydvasthd, it is denoted by the radical element in a finite or infinitival verb. 
It would be worthy of notice here that the'Naiya yikas and the Bhatta-mimarhsakas maintain that a kriyd is perceptible and may be visualised under cer-
18 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
tain conditions ; whereas, the Prabhakaras hold that it falls beyond the scope of the senses and it comes to be iknown only through inference from fur thejcontact preceded by disjunction (vibhayapurvaka-samyoya).It should also be remembered that Indian philosophers, like Sankara, draw pointed attention to the funda mental difference between a 'kriyd and a jndna, which consists in the former being such as directly falls with in the scope of the will (purnsatantra) and the latter never coming within the scope of the will but having its nature determined byits object (rastutantra).

In common speech, stinidnya means a common fea ture; but, in the technical language of Nyaya, it is equivalent to j&ti and is understood to stand for ageneric feature which inheres in all the individuals constituting a class and is eternal. The individual units (vyakti) of a class may come and go, but the generic attribute common to the whole class exists for ever.
CH. i] PERCEPTION 19   
Humanity, or more literally man-ness (manusyatva) , which is common to all mankind, is eternal and it existed before the origin of man and will continue to exist even after the annihilation of all mankind. A jdti, in this technical sense, is connected with a vyakti through the intimate relation known as samavdya orinherence. An attribute may be common to several individuals and connected with them either through the direct relation of svartipa-sambandha, the related object itself being looked upon as relation, or through someindirect relation (parampard-sainbandha) ;such anattribute is called upddhi and should not be confoundedwith a yd /i. Mfirtati'a, for instance, is not a ;d/i; andit amounts to "being the seat of all activity" (kriy&sra yatva). It is sometimes called sakhandopadM a feature which admits of being defined and stands in need of the help of a definitive expression for its defi nite comprehension; and in this sense, a sakhaydopadhiis said to be nirvacaniya. A jdti like pot-ness (yhatatva) is anirvacanlya does not stand in need of the help of a definitive expression for its comprehension. The Naiya yikas recognise certain generic attributes called akhandopadhis, which are not jdtis but similar to themin all respects except that the relation of the former to their abodes is self-link (svarupa-sambandha) the related thing itself constituting its own relation andthat it is not inherence (samavdya) as in the case ofjdti. Visaya is object ;visayat& is object-ness*, visayata iva is being object-ness and is an akhandopddhi. Prati yogin is correlative; pratiyogitd is correlativeness; pratiyogitdtva is being correlativeness and is an
20 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
akhandop&dhi. Under which of the seven categories should an akhandopadhi be brought? In reply to this question, a Naiyayika would say that it could be 
brought under saniunya, if that term should be under stood to mean all generic attributes jatis and akhantfopddhis. Or, if the term sdmanya should be restricted to a jati, an akhandopadhi could not be brought under any of the seven categories. It should be remembered in this connection that these two kinds of generic attributes (j&ti and akhandopadhi) are the only things that are presentedin thought, by them selves, without the help or mediation of their attributes (svartipatobhdtoa-ioyytih) ;and that thought grasps Jther things only under the aspect of, or only through the mediation of, a qualifying attribute (kincitprakara- 'Quraskarenaiva bh&nayogyah). In Nyajja terminology, a distinction is sometimes made between akhanda 
amtinya and sakhanda-sainanya, the former being a j&ti directly connected with a vyakti and the latter being a generic attribute which is reducible to a jati connected with a vyakti through some indirect relation 
(fiaramparCisatnbandha). For instance, kriyatva (mo tion-ness) is an akhanda-sawanya-, while uigr/afra is a sakhanda-s&manya, as it is equivalent to kriy&sra 
yatva (possessing an activity), which is a generic attribute common to all the tnurtas earth, water, fire, air and mind, and may be said to consist in the jati kriy&tva being present through the indirect relation svasamavfiyi-soniavdyitva (being the intimate substra tum of its own intimate substratum).
CH. i] PERCEPTION 21 How do the Naiyayikas show that it is necessary; to recognise sdtndnyta or jdti as a distinct category?Our experience, in several cases where it relates to diverse objects, exhibits a certain degreeofuniformity^. When we see a human being or a beast, our experience howsoever it may differ in other respects, invariably takes the. form 'this is a man' (ayam manusyah) or 'this is a beast* (ayam mryah). The uniformity that wethus observe in our experience cannot be accounted for otherwise than through the assumption of a generic feature common to all mankind or all the beasts. This  
generic feature is called manusyatra (humanity) in the case of human beings and nirgatva (beasthood)in the case of beasts. Parsimony in thought is relied upon bythe Naiyayikas as a criterion of soundness, when it does not clash with any other criterion which is stronger or more reliable. The principle of economyor the law of parsimony or the Idghava-nydya deter mines the nature of many a h)pothesisin Nyfiya andother systems of Indian thought. According to this principle, a generic feature like manusyatva or mryatvashould be taken to be eternal, one, and connected with men or beasts through the intimate and eternal relation called samavaya (inherence).In one word, it should be taken to be a jdti in the technical sense, in the in terest of Idghava, so long as there is nothing preventing the hypothesis of jdti being put forward in the case under consideration. Thus, through perceptual ex perience, one might arrive at a jdti, in order to accountfor uniformity in such experience. There are several cases in which perceptual experience of a whole class
22 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
is impossible or it happens to be restricted to a few andnot accessible to all. For instance, in the case ofsubstances (dravya), only three of them earth, waterand fire are perceptible to the external senses, some of their varieties being imperceptible. Though atvian (spirit or soul) is perceptible to the inner sense called wanas (mind), its existence as a dravya cannot be taken for granted at the stage at which the jati drQzyatzfa (substancencss)is yet to be established. In such circumstances, the Nai)fiyikas maintain the neces sity for rcn-jjiii -in.; a jati by means of infeicnce (anmn&na) aided by the principle of parsimony(laghava). By way of illustration, their argument to establish dravyaiva may be set forth here. Only a substance can be samarayikarana (intimate cause or inherent cause). Human thought,in respect of causa lity (karanata) as in other respects, shows a habitual preference for compactness and unity. The conception of karanata could serve some useful purpose in life, only when it takes a definite and comprehensive form;and it cannot take a form which is at once definite and
comprehensive, so longas it is not specifically delimited in its scope by a comprehensive and definite adjunct. In other words, a suitable delimiting adjunct of kara nata ( (karanatavacchcdaka),besides a similardelimiting adjunct of karyata or cffcctness (karyatavacchedaka)should be thought of in the case of every comprehen sive and definite statement of causal relation (Surya k5rana-bh&ra). The need for such a statement being taken for granted in the case of the samav&yi-kdranatdbelonging to substances as a class, it follows that this
CH.I] PERCEPTION 23   
kdranatd is definitely determined in its scope by a deli miting adjunct which is common to all the substances. Such a delimiting adjunct in the case of samavdyi kCirana (samavtiyi-karanataracchedaka')is called drav yati'a. Economy in thought, in the absence of anyoutweighing <li>;u:v,'-n!;i^c or difficulty, would neces sarily lea(J to dravyatra (substanceness) being assumed! to be eternal (nitya), one (cka) and connected with all the substances through samardya, i.e., a jCiti in the technical sense. This argument is usually stated in Sanskrit thus: 
"Dravyanisthd samavdyikdranatd (yin/aw, saih yogam, libhugam vdprati), yatkinciclanugata 
dharniaracchinnu, kdranatutvat, dandanistha 
yjiatakdranattirat." 
Some jdtislike draryati'd (substanceness)are more comprehensive (para)as compared with prthivl tra (earthness) and less comprehensive as compared^ with sattd (existence) ; while yhatatza (potness)is the least comprehensive (apara) of all the jdtis in the series of jdtis sattd, dravyatia, prthivitva, ghafatva. In every series of jdtis,it will be seen that sattd is the most comprehensive jdti and is the generic attribute characterising the one sttmmmn genus recognised in the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, which may be called sat andto which Kanada gives the technical name artha. Everyseries of ;a/y ends with its own antya-jdti, whichcharacterises its infinta species. Thus in the Nyaya Vaisesika system, while there are several antya-jdtis and diverse infimoe species, there is only one higher
24 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in j&ti, viz., satta and one summum genus. Jdtis, in cluding satta, can inhere only in substances, qualities and activities (dravya, guna and karma) and cannotinhere in any other category. The predication, of satta with reference to the remaining positivecate gories, sdmanya, vifcsa and samavciya, is explained away by the Naiyayikas, on the basis of co-inherence, and not on the basis of inherence. Propositions like 'dravyam sat\ 'guriah san', 'karma sat1convey that satta inheres in a dravya or guna or karma; whereasthe propositions 'sam&nyam sat', 'visesah sanfah', 'samavdyah san9 should be interpreted as referring to the co-inherence of samtinya, visesa and samai'dya with sat id in the same place.   
In his Sutra, "S&mdnyam visesa iti bttddhyapck sam" (ch. I-ah-2-su 3), Kanada observes that 'genera lity and speciality are dependent upon the nature of the view-point*. Some modern writers on Indian logic, more especially some writers in English, are misled by this Sutra into the belief that Kanada was in favour of a conceptualist view of samdnya and would reduce it to a conceptual factor existing only in thought. Thismisapprehension results from an imperfect knowledgeof Kanada's position. Kanada maintains, partlyin anexplicit way and implicitlyin part, that jdtis are eternal universals, existing outside the sphere of thought in the same sense in which other realities exist ; and that a jdti is looked upon as a generic feature (samdnya) or a specific differentia (z(t&?a), according as it is con ceived of as a unifying or differentiating factor. ForCn.i] PERCEPTION 25   
instance, substanceness (dravyatva) is a samanya, whenit is looked upon as a generic feature common to all the substances; but it is a viscsa when it is looked upon as the differentia of substances, by means of which they areilibi':i.. i-'.nl from other things like qualities andactivities. One could clearlysee how solicitous Kanudareally is^to establish the reality of jatis, from the signi ficant way in which he uses the phrase arttya-iisesa to designate the distinct category known as rifesah, so that they may not be confounded with jatis looked uponas differentia. 
To philosophise, according to the exponents of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, is to unify, wherever possible, through universals arrived at on the basis of observed similarities or uniformities, and to ramify and differen tiate, wherever fidelity to experience requires it, through differentiating features arrived at from ob served dissimilarities. This process,in the direction of generalisation, has led to several jatis being recog nised, and in the direction of differentiation, has re sulted in the hypothesis that a unique, self-differentia ted and cuTl.tMiiig feature called 'particularity' (viscsa) should be attributed to every everlasting sub stance that could not be otherwise ilisiin^uMu'd fromsimilar everlasting substances. Composite substances like a jar or a cloth, made of component parts, can easily be distinguished from each other by means of the different parts constituting them. Eternal substances, which are alike in respect of guna, Karma and jati, like the eternal atoms of earth, water, fire or air, cannot be
26 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
distinguished from similar substances of the same class without ascribing to them some unique feature called visesa. In our perceptual experience, one thing is differentiated from another thing through a distin- ., feature. As a matter of fact, in the super 
:' ' 
., . 
normal perceptual experience (alaukika-pratyaksa) ofseers and Yogins, one atom of earth is distinguished from another atom of earth; in such cases, there mustbe a differentiating feature; no yuna, karma or jdti can be relied upon as a di-tinguNhi:!'.; feature, for in those respects, all atoms of earth are alike; even the super normal perception of a Vogin cannot change the funda mental nature of things (I'astu-srabhara) and cannot see a man as a beast or a horse as an ass; it is the fundamental nature of perception, both normal andsuper-normal, that it distinguishes one object fromanother through a disiiijuujxlsjug feature; and thus, the perception of one atom of earth as distinct fromanother atom of the same kind, super-normal as it happens to be, should be accounted for by ascribing to each atom of earth a unique feature called viscsa. Byfollowing the same line of argument, it would be necessary to ascribe a rises a to each of the atomsconstituting producible substances (janya-drarya). 
These vixcsas should be taken to be self-discrimi nating (svatoryavartaka) or self-differentiated (svato ry&vrtta). If a visesa were to be differentiated from another vifcsa or from any other object through some distinctive feature other than itself or its own svar&pa, it would lead to an endless
CH. i] PERCEPTION 27   
assumption of distinctive features and this lire ofthought cannot be sound as it is vitiated by ana vasthd or endless regression. It follows necessarily that each risesa stands isolated and unique; and exhypothesiteven a jaii called risesatva, common to all the risesas, becomes inadmissible for the reason that a visesa wotrld cease to be self-descriminating were it to be associated with a jati, every jati including sattd turning out to be a differentia in cases of contrast with things devoid of that jtiti. 
AH the Vaisesikas and Naiyayikas agree that each atom should be taken to have a unique visesa inherent in it, that the relation between a visesa and its abodeis inherence (scMKK'aya) and that visesas are eternal. There is, however, some difference of opinionas to whether every eternal substance should be taken to have a visesa. It is necessary that each jiva (indivi dual soul) and each inanas should be assumed to ha' e a unique visesa; for, though, when a jivais in a state of bondage (baddha),he and his mind could be shownto have distinctive features in the form of distinctive experiences and such other Characteristics, yet neither a liberated (mukta) jiva nor his mind could be differ entiated from other liberated fivas and their minds, without ascribing to each of them a unique visesa; andthere can be no difference of opinion about this matteramong the Naiyayikas. With regard to ether (akasa), while some Naiyayikas hold that a visesa should be as cribed to it as the delimiting determinant of its causa lity of sound (Sabda-sdmavdyikaraMat&vacchedaka),
28 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
others hold this is unnecessary. In the case of spatial direction (dik) and time (Mia},if they are recognised to be distinct substances, they should be taken to have distinctive visesas; but, while the earlier Naiy&yikas recognise dik and kola to be eternal substances, distinct from others, the later Naiyayikas, like RaghundthaSiromani, would bring dik and k&lu under God (Isvara), uncommon attributes like eternal omniscience being quite adequate to distinguish God from the rest with out the help of a visesa of His own. It should be re membered in this connection that, when the term vise$a is taken in its usual sense of differentia, the phrase antya-visc$a is used to describe the unique category known as viscsa, it being said to be antya for the reason that it stands at the end of all differentiating features, or for the reason that it inheres in eternal substances which transcend creation and destruction and are, therefore, denoted by the word anta. 
When two substances come into contact with each other, their relation is called samyoga; and this relation is not of an intimate character and is separable. Thereis another type of relation which determines determi nate cognitions of objects as associated with certain attributes (visista-pratiti) ; and this relation when it happens to connect two things of which one, as long as it does not become moribund or cease to exist, is always associated with the other two things which are techni cally called ayuta-siddha is known as samavaya.This is an intimate type of relation recognised as sub sisting between component parts and composite wholes
CH. i] PERCEPTION 29  
(avayaia and arayavin) , qualities and substances (guna and dravya), movements and moving substances (kriya and dravya}, genericattributes and the indivi 
duals forming a class (jati and vyaTtti), and particula rities and eternal substances (visesaznd nityadravya) . The intimate relation of satnavdya stands in markedcontrast with contact (saihyoga) which is not an in dissoluble relation and is easily lost. With some effort the Naiyayikas distinguish samavdya from another type of relation recognised by them, which is known as svariipa-sambandha or self-relation and which consists in one of the related things being looked upon as com prising a relational phase forming a connecting link. For instance, time-relation (kdlika-sambandha) is time (kdla) itself looked upon as a connecting link between time and things limited in time. Numerous varieties ofsvarapa-sambandha are recognised by the Naiyayikasin all cases where cognition of an object with its adjunct (visista-pratiti), the configuration of which in volves three cognised factors an adjunct (visesana), an object qualified by it (visesya) and their relation, has to be accounted for through some relation andwhere that relation cannot be contact or inherence (samyoga or samavdya). The conception of svarupa sambandha is pressed into service too much by the Naiyayikas and is pushed too far in their view regard ing the relation of tdddtmya (complete identity), whichforms the relation underlying cognitions like this 'a jar exists in itself. It is maintained by the Naiyayikas that, though a relation ordinarily implies difference
30 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
the relation of identity should be considered an ex ception and cannot be ignored since it is presentedin valid experience. 
The Nyaya conception of jati may, with advan tage, be compared with the views held by the Vaiya karanas (Grammarians), Bhattas, Prabhakaras, Baud dhas and Advaitins on this subject. The term jati, ac cording to Indian Grammarians, primarily denotes class-attributes in the Nyaya sense; and terms denoting caste, lineage and followers of a Vedic school are also treated as terms denoting a jati for purposes of the application of certain grammatical rules framed with reference to terms denoting jati (jativaci). TheBhatta-mlmamsakas hold that a jati like cowness(yolva), horseness (asvatva}is eternal, omnipresentand perceptible; that, though present everywhere, it is manifested only in and through the individual objects comprising a class and that such objects are called vyaktis chiefly for the reason that they serve to manifest jati', and that their relation to vyaktis is not inherence (samavdya) but relative identity or identity compatible with difference (tadatmya). The relation of tadatmyot according to the Bhattas, is not absolute identity, as the Naiyayikas take it to be ; but it is identityin a relative sense i.e. identity (abheda) compatible withdifference (bheda-sahi$nu). Though difference andidentity are ordinarily opposed to each other, yet they; are taken by the Bhattas to be compatible with eachother, on the ground that it is experience,after all, that determines the compatibility or incompatibility of two
^H.IJ PERCEPTION * l   
things and that experience warrants the recognition of difference, associated with identity, as forming the rela tion between jdti and vyakti. In the proposition'this h a horse' (ayam asvah),for instance, 'this' refers to a particular vyakti and 'horse1, according to the Bhattas, primarily refers to horseness (osvatva), whichis a jati According to this view, in the judgment em bodied in this proposition, a jdtiis equated with a vyakti. But this equation cannot be absolute as, in that case, the two words 'this* and 'horse* would turn out to be synonyms. Therefore, the Bhattas argue that, on the strengthof what is presentedin cognition, a peculiar relation ;'::,.,in difference-cum-identity (bhcdabhcdau), should be recognised in the case of jdti and vyakti. While Naiyayikas restrict jdtis to the first three categories substances, qualities and acti vities, the Bhattas ascribe the highest or the most com prehensive j&ti called existence (sattd)to those three categories and also to the fourth category, generality (sdmdnya). The Prabhakaras, on the other hand, con tend that a jati or generic attribute can be recognised only in perceptible substances, and any common attri bute which cannot be perceivedalike by the learned andilliterate in vydktis should not be regarded as a jati. It would follow from this that cowness (gcttva) and such other attributes may be regarded as j&tis, while -existence (sattd), substanceness (dravyatva), and such other attributes are not jdtis. According to these philosophers, the relation between a jati and vyakti is inherence (samavdya), as in the Nyaya system, the re-

lation of tdd&tmya consistingin difference-cum-identity being discarded as an impossible jumble. 
The Buddhistic idealists would reduce all jatis to the negative form of 'difference from the rest* (svetara bhcda), cowness (gotva),for instance, being nomore than difference from things other than a cow(yavetarabheda}. They ridicule the Nyaya doctrine of jati in this strain: "Eternal cowness, dogness, assness and such other jatis where do they exist, after all the cows, dogs and asses cease to exist at the time of uni versal dissolution (pralaya) ? Do they exist in God?To say so would be blasphemy. When a dog or an ass or a cow dies, does its jati leave it? It cannot doso, for the reason that only substances can move. When a cow is just born, how does it cometo have cowness ? It cannot be said that cow ness is produced in a new-born calf, for jati is eternal and has no origin. Nor can it be said that a jati loses some of its parts when a ryakti ceases to exist, and acquires additional parts as new vyaktis are produced ; for eternal jatis can have no parts. Indeed, in your doctrine of jati, you have brought a hornet's nest to your ears." The Advaitic monists of the post-Sankara and pre-Sankara stagesin the history of Indian monismcleverly use the Nyaya theory of jati to their profit, byshowing that the highest jati, existence (satta),is the grand generality (mahasaManya}, which represents the only absolute realitycalled Brahman, and that the various vyaktis and smaller jatis like yotva and asratva
Cn. i] PERCEPTION 3&  
are but appearances super-imposed upon the absolutesatta. 
Inherence (samavaya) is recognised by Prabha karas in cases where two inseparable things (ayuta siddha) are intimately connected with each other; but it is taken to be eternal in cases where both the related objects are eternal, and non-eternal in other cases. It is, the obsession of economy (l&yhava) that has led the Naiyayikas to hold that inherence is eternal and one.. In the place of sawat'aya, the Bhattas and Advaitins recognize the relation of difference-cum-identity (tddat mya). Fiscsas, in the sense in which the Vaisesikas and Nai>ayikas recognize them, are not recognized by;, other Indian philosophers, who find it easy to disprove the necessity for recognizing I'isesas by pointing out that the self-discriminating capacity ascribed to risesas might be attributed, with advantage, to eternal bubstan ces themselves. 
In order to completely understand the Nyaya doc trine of jatj, it is necessary to pay some attention to the principles which Udayanacarya, one of the greatest exponents of Nyaya in the tenth century, laid down for determining which of the numerous common attributes presented in one's experience should be treated as j&tis and which should not be. These principles are six*: (1) the individuals in question being only one (vyak tyabheda); (2) the individuals in question being the same neither more nor less (tulyatva) ; (3) attributes which exclude each other in some places being found together elsewhere (samkara) ; (4) endless regression 3
34 A PRIMER OF INDIAN" LOGIC [PARTIII   
(anai'astha) ; (5) giving up the distinctive feature made out ex hypothesi (rupahani} ;and (6)the absence of the necessaryrelation (asambandha).In his Kiranavall, Udayana sums up these six principlesin this verse : 
^Vyaktcrabhedastulyatvam samkaro'thanaz'asthitih ; Rupahdnirasambartdho jatibadhakasariiyrahah." 
Etherness (akasatra} cannot be a jati, for the obvious reason that, according to Naiyayikas, ether is eternal and one and that there is no question of form ing a class consisting of several similar individuals. There can be no distinction between jarness and potness 
(kalatatva and ghatatva), as the jars or pots, whichform the class in view and to which the generic attri bute in questionis ascribed, happen to be the same. Senseness (indriyaiva}co-exibts with elementness 
(bhutatva) in the external senses like the visual sense constituted by fire; indriyatva is dissociated fromIthutatva in the mind (manas),which is not a bhuta; fyhfttatva alone exists in a jar, which is made of earth and not a sense; the only possible relations that are warranted by experience, between two attributes re cv/.-.ii-.sl to be jatis, are inclusiveness and mutual exclu siveness; for instance the sphere of dravyatva includes that of ghatatva, while ghatatva and patatva (jarness and clothness) are mutually exclusive; so, neither indri yatva nor bhutatva can be regarded as a jati, on the ground of unwarranted blend (samtiarya). If all the jatis were to be supposed as having a jati common to them there would be endless regression in this way.n. i] PERCEPTION 35   
Suppose the jatis we start with are three a, b and c\ if we assume that these three fat is have a jati commonto them called A*, the total number of jatis would becomefour 0, 6, c and #; and having committed ourselves to the position that there should be a jati common to all jatis, the meaning of the word all will increase at every step by ofie more jati being added to the list and weshould go on assuming an endless series of jatis com mon to all jatis, like x, x*-, x%, x*. Thus, on the groundof endless regression (anavastha), a jati called fatitva, common to all jatis t cannot be recognized. To say that visesatva is a jati common to all the visesas would be fatal to the distinctive feature of self-differentiation (svato-vyavartakatva), which is ascribed ex-hypothcsi to visesas. The hypothesis of antya-visesas (ultimate particularities) is put forward for differentiating eternal substances which could not be otherwise differ entiated. If the antya-visesas were to have a jati vtte safra common to them, they would cease to be self-differ entiating ;for in the case of objects having jatis fit to be treated as differentia, it is a well-established habit of thought to rely upon such generic differentia? for pur poses of differentiation and not upon the things them selves that have to be differentiated. Thus visesatva cannot be treated as a jati, since it would jeopardise the distinctive feature of visesas svato-vydvartakatva and
thus involve rupahdni. Negation-ness (abhdvatva) is a feature common to all the varieties of non-existence (abhava) ; but this common feature cannot be regardedas a j&ti, for the reason that there is difficulty in recog nizing the relation of inherence (sa/na: -aya) as a link
36 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
serving to make abhava the substratum of any attribute or the attribute of any substratum. In cases like this, the jdtibadhaka is called asambandha, the required re lation of inherence being impossible. 
Samanya and visesa may appropriately be described as the two poles of the pluralistic realism of the Nyaya Vaisesika system. Satta, the highest sdmcnya, to which the NaiySyikas rise with a true philosophic in stinct, is not allowed to exhibit itself in its full glory as the all-comprehending absolute reality. Between the two poles of s&manya and visesa, the pluralistic uni verse of Nyaya is sought to be fitted to a threefold scheme of external relations contact (samyoga), self linking relation (svarupa-sambandha) and inherence (samavdya) a scheme which, with the eternal and intimate relation of samavdya, turns out to be the Pro crustean bed of Nyaya thought. The Nyaya doctrines of sdtnonya, visesa and samavdya exhibit fatal weak nesses. If uniformity of experience should necessitate the assumption of sdmGnya and if the principle of parsimony (Idghava)should lead to a sain anya being taken to be eternal, strict consistencyin thought would necessarily result in one absolute all-comprehending reality in the shape of satta being recognized and thus the Advaitic monist would find it easy to demolish the pluralistic realism of Nyaya. If an tya-viscsas should be taken to be self-discriminating to avoid anavasthd, why should not the self-discriminating capacity, ascribed to them, be attributed to such eternal sub stances as could not be otherwise distinguished and thus save the Nyaya thought from the cumbersome
CH. i] PERCEPTION 37   
doctrine of visesasl The Nyaya philosopher, whotakes samavaya to be eternal and one and yet seeks to avoid inherence of colour (rnpa-samavoya) being ab surdly jumbled together with the inherence of touch (sparsa-sawiavaya)in air, which is a colourless sub stance, is only swallowing a camel but straining at a gnat, when he refuses to accept the relation of relative identity \tdddtmya=bhedabhedan) in the place of in herence on the ground that bheda and abheda are in 
compatible.

T Non-existence is of 
four kinds: antecedent non 
existence, annihilative non-exis 
tence, absolute non-existence and
mutual non-existence. 
In rendering the term abhava, the two terms non existence and negation are commonly used. Of these two, the former term is nearer to the Sanskrit wordabhava; and the latter term is likely to prove some what misleading, as it primarily refers to negative ex pression rather than to the negative category denoted by such expression. In the previous section, it waspointed out that abhdvatva could not be treated as a jdti. Some Nai>ayikas take abhavatva to be an akhando pddhi, while others describe it as consistingin the negation of sattd (existence) through the relation ofinherence (samavaya) as well as its negation throughco-inherence (ckdrtha-samavdya). Abhava is defined as a thing which neither has samavaya nor is samavaya.
38 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
Things which are yetto be produced are referred to as non-existent prior to their production. Whenthreads are ready and a cloth awaits production, it is said "Here, a cloth will come into being" (atra pato* lha.'isyati). Such expressions conveying the non existence of a product prior to its creation should be relied upon as evidence of antecedent non-existence (pr&gabhara). According to the Naiyayikas, every producible object (knrya) is invariably preceded by its own antecedent non-existence (pra(jabh<na}, which is also regarded as a necessary part of the causal machi nery required for producing an effect. This forms an important element in the creationistic theory of causa tion upheld by the Naiyayikas. They maintain that a pragabhai'd has no beginning but comes to an end at the moment of the creation of its counter-correlative (pratiyoyin) which is the product in question; that its abode is invariably the intimate or material cause (sainavdyi-karana) ; that it is destroyed bythe com plete causal apparatus which immediately produces the effect in question; and that it is usually referred to by an expression which, though affirmative in form, con veys an implied negation such as "Here the jar will come into being" (atra yhato bliavisyati). The Nyayatheory of creation ism (drambha-vada) is as insepa rably bound up with the view that what is destroyed is annihilated completely and can never arise again, as, on the other side, with the view that what is created is produced for the first time and never existed before. Every created bhava (positive entity) is, therefore, hemmed in between two kinds of non-existence, ante-
CH.I] PERCEPTION 39   
cedent and annihilative (prdgabhava and dhvamsa).Pradhvamsa is thus produced; and it can never cometo an end, since the end of dhvariisa would mean the regeneration of what is once annihilated which, ac cording to Naiyayikas, is impossible. Dhvamsa, like frti'iiil>Inl*'a 9 abides in the intimate or inherent cause of what is destroyed and it is presented in experiences, such as 'the jar is annihilated* and 'the annihilation ofthe jar is produced' ('yhato dhrastah', 'yhatadhvariiso j'atah'). Some Naiyayikas of the Nuddea school, like Raglnnulha Siromani, hold that, though it is clearly necessary to recognizedht'aihsa on the strength of cer tain experiences common to all,it cannot be said that prdyabhdva is supported by any such experience andantecedent negation may well be explained as no morethan complete non-existence (atyantabhdva) viewedparticularly in association with the time preceding the creation of the effect in question. The earlier school of Nyaya, however, argues that, if the prior non-exis tence of a cloth (pata-prdyabhava) were not recognized as a special type of non-existence, having no beginningbut coming to an end at the moment at which the cloth comes into being, the absurd result that the same cloth is produced again and again in an endless series ofsuccessive moments (f>atadhdrtif>atti) would follow; and that, if the prior non-existence of a cloth be re cognized as a special type of non-existence formingone of the factors constitutingthe causal apparatus of the cloth, no such absurd result would follow, oneof the causes of the cloth, vis. its own prayabhava, ceasing to exist at the first moment of the creation of
40 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
the cloth. 'On this spot there is no jar' (atra Vhutale ghato ndsti) expressionslike this, and experien ces corresponding to, and embodied in them, refer to a certain type of non-existence which is not restricted to the past, present or future but has reference to all time. In this respect, this variety of abhava stands out in sharp contrast to the two varieties, already men tioned prdgabhdva and dhvamsa and is called atyanta bhava, absolute non-existence, its presence being en tirely independent of its counter-correlative (prati yogin) being produced or destroyed. Absolute non existence (atyantdbhdva)is eternal and the pluralistic universe of Nyaya is wide enough to accommodate in numerable such atyantabhdvas. 
The concept of abhava is complex and involves several factors. In order to encompass completely anabhava in thought, one has to think of it in association with five factors viz.> counter-correlative (pratiyoyin), ^correlated substratum (anuyoyin),the determining ad junct of the former which delimits the scope of counter-correlativeness (pratiyogitavacchedakadharmu], the adjunct delimiting the scope of the substratumness (anuyogitd), and the relation which determines the counter-correlativeness of an object (pratiyoyitd- *uaccHedak(asambandIia*). Taking a specific instance of atyantdbhdva^ such as is embodied in the proposition <On this spot there is no jar' (atra bhutalc ghato ndsti), these five factors may be illustrated. What is intended to be denied, or that object the non-existence of which is referred to here, is not a particular jar
H. i] PERCEPTION 41   
but the whole class of jars. What is soughtto be conveyed is that no jaris present here, not even a single jar. In this case, jar, in general,is the prati yogin and the sphere of its pratiyogitd is delimited byjarness (yhatatva), i.e. it is found wherever jarness is found or in every jar. In other words, in this case jarness (ghatatva)is said to be the pratiyogitavacche dakad/iarma. A reference to the non-existence of anobject amounts to a denial of its existence. When onethinks of the existence of an object, one has to think of its presence in a certain place through some rela tion. This relation which is intended to be broughtwithin the scope of the denial kept in view is knownas the relation determining the pratiyoyila (pratiyo gitavacchcdakasambandha). In other words, it is the relation through which the counter-correlative is in tended to be conceived of as present,in the particular place, if it were present there. The intended relation may vary in different cases. In the case of the abhavareferred to in the proposition 'There is no jarin con tact with this place' (atra samyogcna yhato nasti), the relation kept in view as determining the presence of the object denied (pratiyogitavacchcdakasambandha) is contact (saihyoya). On the other hand, in the case of the abhava referred to in the proposition 'There is no jar inherent in this place' (atra samavayenafjhato nasti), inherence (samavdya) constitutes such a relation. The former of these two propositions maybe true where the non-existence of a jar is predicated *as present in the component part of a jar (kapala) ;
42 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m
while in that case the latter proposition would not betrue. For a kapdla may not have any jar in contact with it; but a kapala must have inherent in it the jar of which it is a component part. The placein which the non-existence of an object is said to be present is anuyoyin and its adjunct which delimits the scope of the substratumness (anuyoyitd)is called the anu- 
.':. '-.*''/ . A specific reference to this '_ 
is necessary. To say 'there is no jar on the earth/ is altogether different. In the former case, this-spot ncss (ctadbhulalatva] is the anuyoyitavacchcdaka dharma; and in the latter case it is earthness (bhutala i va ) a feature common to the whole of this world. For the reason that the cognition of abhdva is so complex as to comprise these five factors, it is placed on a par with a cognitionof an object associated with an adjunct (visistabuddhi),the abliava itself being treated as the chief object (viscsya) and the remaining factors set forth above being reminded as adjuncts (visesana). In the case of prdyabhdvas and dhvam sas also, to know them definitely would be to cognise them in association with these five factors, the contain ing correlative or correlated substratum (iinuyoyln) of these two varieties of abhava being the respective inherent cause (sawardyi-kdraija) and the relation determining their pratiyoyitd being inherence (sama vdya). These three abhdvas prdyabhdi'a, dhvamsa;and atyantdbhdra are otherwise known as /,.' '/ -a abhdva, varieties of non-existence, the praiiyoyitd of which is delimited by some relation other than complete identity (tdddtniya). Mutual negation or differeri-  
CH. i] PERCEPTION 43   
tiative non-existence (anyonydbhara bhcda) amountsto difference; and it is a variety of non-existence, the pratiyogita of which is determined by identity (tddal mya=aikya). <A jaris not a cloth' (yhatah pato na} 
in propositions like this, difference (anyonydbhava, mutual non-existence)is referred to. In this case, the presence of a jar in a cloth, or of a cloth in a jar, through die relation of complete identity, is denied; or, for all practical purposes,the identity of the two ob jects referred to is denied. It should be borne in mindthat tadatmya, in the Nyaya sense, is absolute identity and that tadatmya, in the Bhatta sense, is relative identity or difference-cum-identity. The variety of ablidva is eternal in the case of eternal objects andnon-eternal in other cases. Some old Naiy'ayikas vSpeak of a certain type of ablidva called sdmayikd bhdva, which, according to them, ib a temporaryvariety of non-existence cognized, for instance, in the place from which a jaris removed for a time and to which it is re-introduced afterwards. But the general sense of the Naiyayikasis in favour of equating samayikabhdva with ever-lasting atyantdbhtira, whichmay be cognized for a time and may not be presented in certain forms of thought, owing to the absence of the relation determining the presence of abhavain a certain place. In the case of an abhava, the rela tion which determines its presencein a certain place, or its being contained (adheya)in a container (adhi karana) is known as vaisistya. This is but a variety of self-linking relation (svarupa-sambandha) and con sists in the particular container itself viewed in asso-
44 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
ciation with the particular moment at which the counter-correlative in question (pratiyogin) is not present on that spot; in other words, the particular container, as such, constitutes the raiSistya. 
It is noteworthy here that, according to the Naiya yikas of the older school, total non-existence is never vogni -od in the substratum of antecedent or annthila tive non-existence. (Dhramsaprdyabhtii'tidhikarancat yantdbhdvo ndnyikriyatc). This is not accepted by the later Naiyayikas. Some Naiyayikas hold that the delimiting adjunct of pratiyoyitd, in the case of anatyantQbhava, may be an attribute which never belongs to the particular pratiyoyin. For instance, in the pro position 'A jar does not exist as determined by cloth ness* (yhatah patati'ena ndsti) jar is the pratiyogin and clothness (patatra)is the pratiyogitaracchcdaka dharina. This type of atyantdbltdrais known as I'yadliibarctnadharmtii'acchiHnapratiyoyittikdbhdra a form of non-existence whose counter-correlativeness is determined bya dclisiiiiin^ adjunct which is never co-existent with what is delimited by it. This formof non-existence is omnipresent (kwaltinrciyi) and is co-existent even with its own pratiyoyin which is n >t ordinarily possible. Several later Naiyayika>reject this view and explain cases like 'yhatahpatati'ciui ntisti', by taking the total non-existence of clothness 
(patati'tityanttibhdz'a)to be referred to. Advancedstudents of Advaita would be able to see how the 
theory of 'non-existence delimited by an incompatible adjunct' (vyadhikaranadharniavacchinnapratiyogitaka-OH. i] PERCEPTION 45  
bhara) turns out to be a treacherous device whichAdvaitins could conveniently use in proving the un reality of the world. 
There is much divergence among the different school^ of Indian philosophy in this matter. A stu dent of Nyaya should be able to contrast the Nyayaview of abhtira with the views of the Bhattas andPrabhakaras about abhtira. Like the Naiyayikas the Bhattas also hold that ablidra is a distinct category^ The latter maintain that every reality has a positive side consisting of positive attributes, and a negative side represented by non-existence (abhura). Thus abhdra is an attribute of reality a bhuradhanna or rastudharma. According to the Bhattas, abluiva is cognised by a special instrument of cognition, which is called non-cognition (annpalabdhi) and which consists in the non-cognition of an object when all the condi tions necessary for its cognition are present. In the Bhatta scheme of pram anas (instruments of valid cognition), anupalabdtii is given the sixth place andit is known as the sasthapramdna and it is itself some times called abhdva. The term abhara used in the sense of anupalabdhi, should not be confounded with the abhdva which is the object of this pramdna(prcmcya). The Naiyayikas, on the other hand, con sider that abhdva is known through one or the other, as the case may be, of the pramdnas recognized by them. In fact, of the four pramdnas recognized by them viz.: pratyaksa (perception), anumdna (in ference), upamana (comparison) and sabda (verbal
46 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
testimony) abhdva may come within the scope of the first, second or the fourth, as the case may be. TheNaiyayikas contend that non-cognition, or strictly speaking, effectual non-cognition (yoyyanupalabdhi), serves as a necessary accessory to pratyaksa, in cogni zing abhdva. In the case of a samsaryubhdva, it can be perceived only when its pratiyoyin happens to be perceptible; while in the case of anyonyabhara, it can be perceived only when its annyoyin is perceptible. Forinstance, one would be able to perceivethe non-ex,is tence of a jar on a certain spot, but not the non-exis tence of air in a place; whereas, one could perceive the difference from ether (akasa-bheda)in a jar. TheNaiyayikas further explain that the effectuality ( yoyyalti) of non-cognition (annpalabdhi) when it helps a pramana in ,.,!", abhdva, consists in there being no cognition when all the conditions required for it are present. 
The Prabhakaras refute the theories that abhavais a distinct category and that annpalabdhi is a distinct pramana. They contend that the basis of negative pro positions is the mere container (kcvalddhikarana). For instance, in the proposition"Here, on this spot, there is no jar", the only thing which, in fact, is re ferred to is the empty floor (kcvala-bhutala).If abh&va should thus be equated with the empty container (l^cvalddliikarana) t it might easily be argued from the opposite camp that this is an evasive trick of the Pra bhakaras which could be easily seen through and that the concept of the 'emptiness of the container* inevi tably presupposes non-existence. The Prfibhakaras,
CH. i] PERCEPTION 47  
however, meet this difficulty by explaining that the phrase 'empty container* is only a description of the form of the cognition underlying negative statements and that abhara, strictly speaking, is the cognition of the container, and of nothing ehe, in such circum 
stances as would necessarily lead to the missing object (pratiyoyin) being cognized, were it present. One ofthe greatest Prabhakaras Salikanatha describes abhara thus in the Prakaranapancika:" Abhdva is the cognition of that (container) alone, when the praiiyogin (the thing denied in negative statements) 
ought to have been perceived were it present" (drsycpratiyoyini yd tadckavisayd buddhih sd tadabhdvoryafadisyatc). This view shows a clear idealistic leaning. The weak spotin this theory is that it fails to account adequately for the specific reference to ptatiyogin in negative propositions, since it would be fatal to the Prabhakara view to connect the cognitions underlying them with anything other than the container and it has to be necessarily said that emptiness is not presented as an adjunct in such cognitions. 
In order to avoid needless complications and also endless regression in some cases, abhdvdbhdva is equated by the Naiyayikas with the correspondingbhdva (positive entity), on the ground that a denial of the non-existence of a thing amounts to an affirma tion of the corresponding positive entity. Where oneabhdva is said to be present in another abhava, someNaiyayikas equate the contained abhdva with the other abhdva which represents the ,.-:::,ir!iii,; substratum (adhikarana). It would be useful to note here that
48 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART HI   
difference from a certain object is reciprocally co-ex tensive with the absolute negation of the differentia of that object. Difference from a jar (yhatabhcda) is mutually co-extensive with the absolute non-existence of jarness ((jhatatvatyantabhava). 
Abhava is one of the realities recognized by the Naiyayikas. In a sense, it might be said that it is the reality of the greatest moment in the pluralistic universe of Nyaya. Final emancipation (inukti or apat'arya)is 
the highest aim of spiritual life in Nyaya as well as in other systems of Indian philosophy. In Nyaya, nntkti consists in the annihilation of all evils (dnhkhas), the term dithkha in this context comprising everything connected with voluntary activity and leading directly 
or indirectly to the cycle of death and birth (prctya bhdva) and including in this manner every form of pleasure (snklia). In the language of Nyaya, innkti is Gtyantikadnh'bliadli'i'aiiisa.It would be a mistake to suppose that the Naiyayikas are pessimists. In fact* no system of Indian philosophy can be said to be pessimistic; for pessimism,in a strict sense, affords nohope or solace, but every system of Indian philosophy aims at the attainment of what it believes to be the highest good and expects its adherents to find comfortin the sumnurtn bonum it offers to them. One can easily see why Naiyayikas attach so much importance to abh&va, having due regard to its close relation to the Nyaya conception of wukti. 
At this stage,it would be useful to consider the Nyaya conception of sainbandha (relation), with f arti-
CH. i] PERCEPTION 49  
cular reference to the Nyaya theory of difference (anyonydbhava). The Naiyayikas maintain that rela tion always presupposes difference and that difference invariably involves total exclusion of identity. Accord ing to this view of sambandha, it may be said that relation in the Nyaya system is wholly external, and in no case internal. Bearing this in mind, one cannot easily understand the rationale of the way in which the Nyaya realists bring relations under different categories contact (saniyoga) being brought under quality (guna) tinherence (samavdya) representing a distinct category, and self-relation (srarftpa-sambandha) being reducible to the form of one or the other of the seven categories, as the case may be. The Naiyayikas hole! that not only the simples which unite into complexwholes, but the complex wholes also, exist as indepen dent entities and that neither the simples nor the wholes, when they happen to be the rclata of some relation, lose their independence.In Western philosophical literature those relations are said to be external which bring the relata together without unifying them, and internal relations are said to be rooted in the very nature of things and serve to transform and to unify, though in varying degrees. In Indian philosophy, the relation of difference-cum-identity (tddatmya)is essentially an internal relation^ according to the Samkhya, Bhatta and Advaita systems. In these systems, where difference is not wholly incompatible with identity, where causa tion is not new creation, but transformation to some extent, and where all relations may be said to involve difference and identity in some sense and no relation 4
50 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
can be recognisedin cases of absolute difference, it can be easily seen that no relation is strictly external andnothing which does not unify,in some sense, can be considered a relation. In the Nyaya-Vaiseika system, difference is uncompromising and amounts to a total negation of tadatmya in the sense of complete identity; it is an external reality and not a mere conceptual product; it is presupposed by every relation, and every relation is thus external. It may be asked whether complete identity (atyantdbhcda=tadatmya) ,which is treated as a sambandha by the Naiyayikas in all cases where a thing is equated with itself, is also an external relation. To this question, a Naiyayika would reply that nothing can be said to be rooted in the nature of a thing, in view of the fact that an attribute (dharnia) is wholly different from a qualified thing (dhannin), a composite whole (avayavin} is totally different fromits component parts (avayava), jati is totally different from vyaki, and that in all cases of relation, the relata, as 
such are different from each other. Even in cases wherecomplete identity (aikya = tadatmya) is recognized to serve as relation, though the relation amounts to a negation of difference (bhcdabhava), yet there would be no inconsistency in recognizing difference between the relata as such; for, where a jar is conceived of as existing in a jar through the relation of identity, whatis denied is the difference between a jar and itself, as determined by jarness (ghatatva), the difference presupposed by the sambandha, in that case, havingreference to the relata as such i.e. as determined byrelatedness (sambandhitra). The opponents of Nyaya
CH.I} PERCEPTION 51   
realism point out that the conception of relation, whichis based upon uncompromising difference incompatible with identity, is unsustainable, in as much as the fundamental function of every relation is to unify, in however small a measure it may be, and fot the reason that it would be absurd to speak of anyrelation of proximity or distance between entirely different things such as Madras and Monday or Vara nasi and Friday. A Naiyayika would meet this kind of objection by saying that the fundamental function ofrelation is to bring together and not to unify to glue and not to weld or solder or fuse, and that any twothings can be brought together or glued together through a relation. With an unyielding pertinacity, the Nyayarealism clings to the conception of uncompromisingdifference and seeks to represent that all relations mustbe taken to be external. Nevertheless the philosophical integrity of Nyaya thought pullsin the opposite direc tion and inevitably leads to compromises with the phi losophical systems recognising infernal relations; andsuch compromises are to be found in 'samyoga the most prominent type of external relation which is possible only between independent substances (dravya) 
being regarded as a quality (guna) which, along with the related elements (samyukta) where it inheres, formspairs of inseparables (ayutasiddha) ; in sawiavftya being regarded as an intimate relation and in the somewha t clumsy efforts made to save its externality by makingit eternal and one and by lettingit survive its relata in several cases; and in the very conception of self-rela*

tion (svarupa-sambandha), more especiallyin the con ception of complete identity (abheda)as a variety of self-relation. These compromises are indeed the weakspots in the walls of the realistic fortress of Nyaya,at which the opponentsof Nyaya, like the Bhattas andAdvaitins, find it easy to effect convenient breaches. 4

atoms. Its non-eternal variety 
consists of its products. Again,
it is of three kinds the three 
varieties being the body (sarira), 
the sense (indriya) and other 
objects (visaya). The earthen 
body is the body that belongs to 
the beings of our class. The
earthen sense is the olfactory 
sense by which one perceives

things.

T Ether is that which has 
sound as its quality. That is 
one, all-pervasive and eternal. 
In the texts given above, the first five substances are defined and classified. These definitions, with the required amplification, are faultless, according to the requirements of what a Naiyayika would consider a valid definition. In these five definitions, the relation 
connecting the respective qualities with the respective substances is inherence (samavaya). In order to makethe first four definitions quite accurate so as to cover cases of earth, water, fire and air in the first momentsof their creation (utpatti-ksana),the device of jatigha titalaksana, already referred to on page 10 supra, i& adopted. In the definition of ether (afodsa), the wordquality (guna) is intended to indicate that sound is the only vifesaguna of this substance. In the Nyayasystem, as in the other systems of Indian philosophy,, the five substances earth, water, fire, air and ether are said to be the five elemental beings (bhuta). TheNaiyayikas define a bhuta as a substance having a special quality which may be perceived by one or the
56 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
other of the external senses (bahirindriyagrahya visesagunavat) ; and the bhutas are contrasted withwhat are called murtas in Nyaya. There are five mftrta substances earth, water, fire, air and mind(manas). A murta is a moving substance (kriya Jraya). 
In the case of earth, water, fire and air, twovarieties are spoken of the eternal and the non eternal. The eternal variety in each case is said to be represented by atoms (paramanu).This leads to a consideration of the atomic hypothesis of the Nyaya Vaiseika system. This hypothesisis closely connect ed with the Nyaya- Vaisesika theory of causation andit forms the pivotal part of the Nyaya-Vaisesika cosmo gony. Though it had its origin mainly in the specu lative thought of Nyaya metaphysics, it exercised a profound influence over many a doctrine of the plura listic realism of Nyaya and it is in no sense less worthyof consideration than the corresponding atomism which, till recently, swayed scientific thought in the Westernworld, until it came to be replaced by the theory reduc ing every atom to a miniature solar system consisting of numerous small electrons gyrating round a sun in the centre. The course of speculative reasoning whichled the exponents of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system to formulate the atomic hypothesis should receive dueattention here. All visible substances are compositestructures consisting of component parts joined together and are large, i.e. have the size (parimana) called largeness (mahattva). Largeness (mahattva) and
CH. i] PERCEPTION 57   
smallness (anutva)are the two main varieties of size recognized by the Naiyayikas and they varybetween two extreme limits, the highest and the lowest. The highest limit of mahattva is called paramamahattva and is ascribed to all-pervasive substances (vibhudravya). The lowest limit ofmahattva .belongs to the smallest visible substance say a mote floating in a sunbeam, one of the conditions of visual preception being association with the size, wahat tva, to the minimum degree at least. The highest limit of smallness (anutva) is the smallest conceivable size (anuta'*tatva==pdrimandalya), which is attributed to atoms (paramdnu). Even the smallest visible subs^ tance is a composite structure consisting of componentparts (savayava}, because it is a visible substance {caksusadravya). We know this from our observation of the nature of visible substances like a jar. Weknow also from our observation of the nature of the component parts of visible substances that such parts produce discrete wholes possessing mahattva ( largeness) and are themselves discrete wholes consisting of distinct parts. In other words, from our observation, we arrive at the generalisation whichever forms a part of a large substance (mahadarambhaka)is itself a discrete whole made up of parts (sdvatyava) . So, even the constituent part of the smallest visible substance -say the smallest mote seen floating in a sunbeam is a discrete whole made up of parts (savayava). Anendless assumption of parts would involve the defect of endless regression (atnavastha}, which is generally regarded in Indian philosophy as a fatal objection to
58 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
the recognition of causal relation or to explanation. It would, therefore, be necessary that the process of divi sion should stop at some point and the point at which it stops is the last conceivable part (avayava). It wouldbe most reasonable to recognizethat as the last con ceivable part, beyond which no kind of argument con strains us to recognize further parts. Beyond the parts constituting the component elements of the smallest visible motes, there is no necessity to recognise further parts, the reason constraining the recognition of parts in the smallest visible substances being that the latter are visible and, likewise, the recognition of parts in the constituents of the smallest visible substances being that those constituents cause a composite whole whichis large (mahadarambhaka), and there being no such compelling reason in the case of the component parts of such constituents, since those parts are neither visible nor members of a large substance. The whole argu ment is usually stated thus in the form of two syllo gisms in Sanskrit : 
"falasuryamaricistham yat suksmatammn drsyate tat sSvayflvam, cdksusadraryatvat, ghatavat. Tadara yavo'fi savayavah, mahadarambhakaivat, kapalavai." 
The smallest visible substance forming the minorterm (paksa) in the first of these two syllogismsis called truti or trasarenu and is regarded as a triad orternary product. Its component part forming the minorterm (paksa) of the second syllogism is called anu or dvyanuka, which is a dyad or binary product. Thesmallest conceivable unitx forming a dyad is called ai
OH. i] PERCEPTION 59   
atom (parani&nu). The component part of a truti is not visible and does not possess even the minimummahattva (largeness) ; and it is, therefore, said to be a minute part (anu). This minute part forms a member
(avayava) of the smallest visible substance called truti which has the minimum mahattva; and it is thus maha d&rambhaka and, for that reason, consists of parts. The parts of each component element in a truti mustbe at least two and need not be more than two and they are therefore taken to be two ; and these two parts are the smallest conceivable units which are taken to be the 
smallest ultimates not admitting of further sub-division and are called atoms (paramanus). It is now apparentwhy each component element of a truti is called a dyad
(dvyanukaa. binary product of atoms). For obvious reasons the component elements of a truti itself cannot be less than two; and they are taken to be three in the Nyaya-Vaisesika system. In other words, a truti or trasarenu is made up of three dyads (dvyanuka). Forthis reason, it is also called tryanuka. The reason whythe number of parts in a truti is fixed at three requires explanation. In our experience, we see that the size (parimana) of the parts gives rise invariably to anincreased size of the same kind in the composite wholeand that this increase is only an increase in degree. Our observation is restricted to substances havingmahattva (largeness). This observation leads to the generalisation that, if a size should serve as the non intimate cause (asamavayiktirana)of another size, both of them, the size that causes and the size that is caused, belong to the same variety of size, and the size
60 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
that is caused represents a higher type of the samevariety, as compared with the size that causes. (Fari mftnanam svasajatiyasvotk'rstaparimanarambha'katva niyamah). A strict application of this rule to anutva
would make it clear that, if the anutva (smallness) of atoms (paramanu) or dyads (dvyanuka) were to be taken as the non-intimate cause (asamavdyikdrana) of dyads or triads (tryanuka),the size of the dyads and
triads should represent a higher degree of smallness (anutaratva) . This is an obviously absurd result, for the reason that tryanuka must necessarily have the minimum mahattva at least, since it is the smallest 
visible substance. So, from the scope of the rule set forth above, the sizes of dyads and triads should be taken away; and this is done by assuming that,in the case of dyads and triads, the size of the compositeproduct (avayavin)is caused, not by the size of the component parts but by their number (samkhyd). in such circumstances, unless the number of the componentparts of a dyad differs from that of the componentparts of a triad, the difference between a triad and a dyad in respect of size cannot be accounted for. Thesize of a triad is mahattva; the size of a dyad is anutva ; the number that causes mahattva must be larger than tivo, which is the number causing the anutvaof the dyads. The simplest thing to do here is to assume the next higher integer three as the numberof the component parts of a triad. Those who closely follow the Nyaya-Vaisesika tradition hold that, in the atomic theory, there is clear justification for some res tuction regarding the nature and number of the com.
CH.I] PERCEPTION 61   
ponent parts in the case of dyads and triads and there is no necessity for recognising any such restriction in the case of composite products (avayavins) beyond the stage of triads. It is maintained that the parts of atriad (tryanuka) are composite structures (savayava), and they cannot be less than three and need not be more than three and therefore must be three in num ber. The constituent elements of the composite pro ducts beyond the stage of triads may be four dyads orfive dyads and so on, or four triads or five triads andso on, according to the varying circumstances in eachcase. 
It should also be borne in mind that atoms anddyads are never presented in normal perception andthat they are capable of combining with each other. In the atomic theory of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, it is assumed that the fiat of the omnipotent God, in conjunction with the inevitable vestiges of the worksdone by embodied souls (/*^0/&), causes concretise activities of various kinds in various atoms; and as aresult of such activities, they come into contact with each other and composite products in the shape ofdyads, triads, and so on, arise. Thus creation(srsti) takes place. The Nyaya theory of dissolution involves what would appear to be an unnatural assumption. Disintegration or dissolution (pralaya) begins not from the top, but from the root not in the whole, but in the parts. The fiat of the omnipotent God, again, in the absence of any demand for creation on behalf ofjivas, causes descretive activities of various kinds in atoms, with the result that the contacts (samypgah)
62 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
by which two atoms are held togetherin dyads are destroyed and all the composite products, beginningfrom dyads, crumble to pieces. 
The opponentsof the atomic hypothesis of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system draw pointed attention to its weak points. In the first place,it is difficult to deter mine which is the smallest visible substatice. Themotes in the sunbeam are not all of a uniform size. What happens to be the smallest visible substance to the naked eye would not be such to the visual sense aided by a powerful microscope. Even tj the nakedeye, the smallest visible substance would not be the same, as visual power varies in different individuals. In cases where the size of a composite product is the effect of the size of its component parts, each compo nent part is a composite product. Where, however, the size of the composite product is regardedas result ing from the number of its component parts, one mayvery well stop with the members of the smallest visible substance and take these members to be two in number.The arguments of anavastha and layhani,if pushed a bit further, would knock off dyadsand atoms andwould lead to the smallest visible substances themselves being regarded as the indivisible ultimates of composite matter. Further, how can atoms come together? How can contact (samyoga)arise between two atoms?In our experience, contact (sawyoga)is possible ordi narily between two composite substances (s&i'ayava) or, in some cases, between one compositesubstance andanother all-pervasive substance (vibhudravya). Con*
CH. i] PERCEPTION 63   
tact is by its very nature spatially non-pervasive (avyapyavrtti) ;if it is presentin one part of a thing it is missing in another part of the same thing; and it can never be said to completely pervade its relata. Such being the case, it is hardly conceivable how an indivisible atom can come into contact with another atom. These are the more important defects in the atomic theory and pointed out by anti-creationistic philosophers like the Advaitins, the Samkhyas and the Mlmamsakas. 
A disingenuous attempt is made by some writer to ascribe the origin of the atomic theory of Kanada and Gautama to Hellenic influence. Luckily and justly, that attempt has failed. In the first place, it has to be remembered that, though KanaJa might have been the earliest complete and systematic exponent of the atomic theory, he cannot be said to be its discoverer and it might have been one of the floating theories of the pre-Kanada period of Indian thought. Further a com parison of Kanada's atomic theory with Greek atomismwould show that the divergences between them are more numerous and striking than similarities. In fact, the only noteworthy similarity between the Indian andGreek theories is that both consider atoms impercepti ble. On the contrary, the Greek conception of atomsrecognizes quantitative differences in them and totally dissociates them from qualities; while, in the Nyaya Vaisesika system, atoms are of uniform size, their size 
representing the extreme limit of minuteness called parimandalya or paramanuparimana, and they have
64 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART ni   
qualities, which are non-eternal in the case of colour, taste, smell and touch in the atoms of earth, and eternal in other cases. Another important difference is that the integration of atoms according to the Nyaya theory is the result of the deliberate design of the omnipotent
and omniscient God ; while atoms in the Greek theory are wholly subject to chance drifts and ,v..:i::o '..'\*>\\ of various types. Professor Keith and those who agreewith him are at liberty to think that these divergences, however fundamental they may be, need not be taken to shut out all possibility of Greek influence, it must, however, be remembered that any suspicion of Greekinfluence has to rest almost entirely on the slender basis of temporal proximity or synchronism and that even this flimsy ground is shattered by the evidences in the early philosophical literature of India in favour of the view that atomic theory might have gained currency in India, in some form, perhaps long before the age of Kanada and Gautama. 
The first three of the five elements (bhiita) earth, water and fire are defined through their characteristic qualities; and the fourth element, air, is defined through the quality of touch in association with the negative adjunct of colourlessness (rfipabhdva). The eternal varieties are represented by the atoms whose nature is described above. In the textual sec tions relating to earth, water, fire and air, the threefold classification, which follows the twofold classification into eternal and non-eternal, divides each of these substances again into body (sarira), sense-organ (indriya) and object (visaya). Sanra (body),inCH.I] PERCEPTION 65  
Nyaya, is the field within whose bounds, the soul (atman) has its experiences (bhogdyatanam) ; or it is antydvayavl or a composite whole which never formsthe component part of another composite whole and it serves as the seat of voluntary activity. In the Nyaya Vaisesika system,a body is constituted wholly by earthy water, fire or air; and it is not made up of five elements (pdncabhtiutika) as admitted in the Sdmkhya andVcdanta systems. A body made of earth, for instance, is constituted entirely by earth which forms its material cause (samavayikarana),the remaining elements form*ing merely supportive (upastambhaka), not constitutive 
(samavtiyi), factors. This is the case also in the bodies made of water, fire and air. The belief that these three varieties of bodies (jalryasarira, taijascu sarira, vdyt avlyasarlra) are ultramundane existences 
and are found in the worlds of Varuna, Aditya andVdyu is based on Puranic cosmology and does not require any discussion here. A sense-organ (indriya) is defined in Nya>a as the seat of such contact with manas as causes a cognition, there being in it no special quality which shows (udbhutavifrsaguna), except sound (sabda). The Sanskrit definition of a sense organ runs thus : "Sabdctarodbhutavisesagunana srayatve sati jnanakdranamanassamyogasrayatvamindnyatvam." It may be noted here that perceptible qualities like colour, touch, etc., may be present in asubstance either in a condition in which it shows(udbhtitd't'dstha) or in a sub-perceptional condition in which it does not show (anitdb hut avast hd). Colourin the former condition, for instance, is visible and
66 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
actually visualised when all the circumstances necessary for visual perception are present and it is present in all visible substances; while, colour in a sub-percep tional condition (anudbhutavastha) though not in herently invisible, is never actually visualised. The term visaya in the threefold classification of earth, water, fire and air turns out to be somewhat misleading in the case of some people. Professor Keith, for instance, takes this term to mean 'an object of sense-perception* and accuses Annambhatta of inadvertence for having brought atoms under visaya. It will be seen that there is no inadvertence on the part of Annambhatta thoughsome of his readers may lose sight of certain matters in their bumptious presumption. The term visaya here means object of cognition (jndnavisaya) ; and in the classification of earth, etc,, what is referred to is 'a variety of earth which is neither body (sarlra) norsense-organ (indriya)'. In other words though Sarlra and indriya are also visaya in the sense of object,it is obvious that, in the classification referred to in the text, they are not intended to be denoted by the termvisaya. Intelligent students of philosophy would not find it difficult to appreciate the ontological and episte m )l<)^ica1 significance of this threefold classification. The knowing souls (jivdh) form the fulcra of the pluralistic universe of the Nyaya realist, in whosephilosophical setting all the things would fall mostnaturally into three groups the cognitional groupcomprising various forms of cognition, their instru ments and their field (bhogayalana),the group ofknowing souls, and the objective group comprising
CH. i] PERCEPTION 67   
cognised objects. The Nyaya realist would thus like to fancy the universe as a bunch of three distinct flowers fastened together by some kind of external relation; while monistic philosophers would feel sorry that the pluralism of Nyaya mistakes an integral three-petalled -flower for a motley cluster. 
In the textual section dealing with fire (iejas), gold and such other valuable metals are said to comeunder the mine-born (d&araya) variety of fire. Through speculative reasoning, the Naiyayikas seek to maintain that gold is light. The yellow metal that we see and handle has some weight. Yellow colour belongs to earth and weightiness to earth and water. So, the metal which has these two properties yellow colour and weightiness, should be taken to be a variety of earth. However, the yellow and weighty substance that we see and handle and commonly regard as gold cannot all be earth; for, however much you may heat it, it does not completely lose its fluidity (dravatva), and any variety of earth, which preserves its fluidity under heat, does so only when it is associated with a substance which is not earth and has fluidity and is capable of counteracting the effect of heat on fluidity. This may be seen in certain varieties of earth, like ghee, placed in water. Thus the yellow substance referred to, though it is itself a variety of earth, should betaken to preserve its fluidity for the reason that it is associated with some other substance which is not earth and has fluidity and counteracts the destruction of fluidity by heat. The latter substance which coun teracts and which has occasional fluidity (na\mitt\k<i-
'68 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
dravatva) cannot be brought under water characterised by natural fluidity (samsiddhikadravatva) ; nor can it be brought under any of the colourless substances, since it has colour. So, the counteracting substance associated with the yellow lump of earth should be a variety offire or light (tejas). This reasoning has got merelyan antiquarian interest and rests upon premises involv ing pre-scientific notions about solidity and fluidity. Even the old-world physical science of India, as knownto ancient Ayurvedic writers, would not accept the assumption that gold never loses its fluidity. 
With regard to air, there is some difference of opinion between the earlier and later Naiyyikas about its perceptibility. The former hold that air is inferred is the substratum of touch which is neither hot nor:old. The latter maintain that air is perceived by the sense of touch. Though it is the same throughout, it :omes to have different names as prdna, apdfta, vyanar uddna and samdna, when it passes through the body, the heart, the anus, the whole body, the throat and the navel. These five aspects of the air are known as the 
vr ital airs. 
The senses of sight, taste, smell and touch arerespectively constituted by light (tejas) ,water (/a/a),, earth (prthivl) and air (yayu). They are all large enough (mahat), the senses of sight, taste and smell (caksns, rasana and ghrana) being triads of the res pective elements (bhuta) and the sense of touch (tvak) spreading all over the body. Though they are large enough, they fall outside the range of external sense-
CH. i] PERCEPTION 69   
perception, for the reason that their qualities are sub perceptional (atoudbhuta),or to be more accurate, for the reason that they are not associated with perceptible colour (udbhntarupa"). 
Ether (Akasa) is inferred as the eternal and all pervasive substratum in which sound inheres. Accord ing to the Samkhyas and Advaitins, it is an element produced and destroyed in the same way as other ele ments. In Nyaya, the sense of hearing is represented by ether delimited by the orifice of the ear. Ether is all-pervasive (rtbhu)in the sense that it comes into contact with all the movable (muria)substances of finite size (paricchinnaparimana*). An all-pervasive substance does not admit of any movement and is one and eternal, divisibilty and non-eternity being incom patible with all-pervasiveness. The sense of hearingis equated with space (dik~ spatial direction) by the Mimamsakas. It should be remembered that the term ether is the nearest approximationto dkdsa as under stood in Nyaya and that the function of serving as the medium of light and heat, which modern science ascribes so ether, does not belong to akaSa.

The above definitions of time and space, or direc tion in space, indicate in simple and clear language, the way in which the exponents of the Nyaya-Vaisesika realism arrive at the two substances known as kala and dik. One of the firmest convictions of the Nyayarealist is that there are objective realities exactly cor responding to the elements constituting the subjective form of every valid experience (annbliara) and that propositions and expressions recognised to be correct should be relied upon as the unmistakable indexes of the forms of experience which they are intended to express. The Naiyayikas argue that events are refer red to as past, present or future, anterior or posterior, simultaneous or occurring in succession, slow or quick, and that such references cannot be accounted for except by the hypothesis that there is a distinct substance 
(dravya) known as kala (time). 'Now the jar is' (idariim ghatah^sudi propositions are understood bythe Naiyayikas as referring to some relation betweenthe jar and the sun's motion, on the basis of the old world astronomical theory that the sun moves on the sky without ever coming to rest. The Naiyayikasbelieve that the sun's motion can be ascertained through perception as well as inference. The common-senseview of men connects the concept of now (idanlm) with the sun's motion (sfiryaparispanda), brought into relation with the thing denoted by the word collocated with id&nlm in expressions like 'iddnim ghatah*. The
CH. i] PERCEPTION 71   
sun's motion is directly related only with the sun, such direct relation being inherence (samaraya)in this case. A jar can be connected with the sun's motion only 
through some indirect relation. The principle of eco nomy (layhava) makes it necessary that the simplest conceivable relation of an indirect nature should be thought of as connecting the sun's motion with a jar. The simplest form of indirect relation that may beconceived of in this case is 'contact with the thing which is in contact with the intimate substratum of the motion in question viz., the sun' (srasamai'dyisam yuktasamyoya). In this chiin of indirect relation the two extreme ends are the two relata viz., motion onthe one side and jar on the other. The sun is the intimate substratum of the motion (svasamavayl) ; the thing in direct contact with it is not the jar, as weknow, but something else; and that something should be taken to be in contact with the jar. The relation of contact being possible only in the case of two subst ances, the soviet/liny, which forms the intermediate link between I:ri":,~i, (the sun) on the one side and contact with the jar (yhatasamyoya) on the other, must be a substance (dravya). This substance is called time (kdla). 
How are we to know that this intermediate sub stance that bridges over the gulf between the sun andajar, is one, eternal and all-pervasive, and does not come under any of the other substances? It is presented! in every experience or expression, explicitly or impli citly, as substratum of other objects; it is not percep tible, nor has it the qualities of colour, touch and
72 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
sound; so, it must be different from the five bhutas; it would be reasonable to suppose that it is of infinite magnitude (paramamahattva),since it is taken to be one and eternal for the sake of economy (Idghava) ; and in view of the distinct cognitions we have of the past, present and future, as compared with the east, west, north and south, we should take time (kdia)to be different from space (dik). In a similar mannerspace (dik) is also inferred by the Naijayikasas the substratum of the contact which serves as the non inherent (asamai'dyi) cause of spatial proximity anddistance (aparatva and paratra),referred to in state ments like ' This lies farther', 'This lies near'. Bothtime and space (kclla and dik) are imperceptible according to the Naiyayikas and are all-pervading substances in which all the things in the Universe maybe said to be present through the self-relation of time or space (kdlikasambandha or daisikasawbandha).While time or space taken by itself (wahdkdla or ckhandadik) is regarded as the containing substratum (adhikarana) of every thingin the world, eternal or non-eternal, only non-eternal objects, among the rest, may be regarded as container (adhikarana) of other objects through time-relation (kdlikasambandha). Thisis embodied in the oft-quoted dictum of Nyaya 4t nityesu Kalikayogah." 
Any producible thing may serve as the condition ing adjunct of wahdkdla (the immense and indivisible time), and anything of limited size as the conditioning adjunct of dkhandadesa (the immense and indivisi ble space). The Naiyayikas say "Janyamatram
CH. i] PERCEPTION 73   
Kdlopddhih, murtamdtram digupddhih." Though time and space are indivisible and all-pervasive, temporaland spatial divisions are conceive! of through associa tion with delimiting adjuncts in the form of someproducible thing (janya) or of something limited in size (murta). In this way, divisions of time to a moment (ksana) downward and divisions of space are arrived at. 
The Vaiyakarana philosophers speak of time andspace as modifications of the subtle sound (sabdatan mdtra), which is a substance (dravya) according to them. The Buddhist idealists regard time and space as merely forms of momentary and fleeting consciousness (rijndna). The Advaitic monists look upon time andspace as phenomenal appearances super-imposed uponthe absolute Brahman, which is the only reality trans cending them. The SarhUiyas would bring both time and space under the elemental evolute (bhuta) called akdsa. Modern Naiyayikaslike Rayhnn&tha Siromanibring time and space under God (Ih'ara) and regard them as phases of the omnipotent and omnipresent Lord. In Chapter II, ahnika I, sutras 40 to 44, of the Nyayasiltrabhtifya, Gautama and Vatsyayana elucidate the conceptions of the present, past and future. Vatsyayana points out that time is presented in our experience mainly through the help of motion and not through association with distance. The F>lia.*\;ikiira observes under 11 1 41, "Nadhvavyahgyah kalah, kim tarhi kriydvyangyah". A kriyd, as understood by Vatsyayana in this context, is not a single activity but
74 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
a series of activities. The conception of a kriya or!karma9 even in its strict sense, is inseparably bound upwith the conception of duration, every kriya lasting for four ksanas (moments)as already explainedin page 16, part in, supra. In this connection, it should be remembered that though there can be no contact between two all-pervasive substances (vibhudravya),there is contact between one such substance andanother substance limited in size;for contact presup poses movement, and in the case of a substance limited in size, movement is possible, though it is not possible in the case of an all-pervasive substance. 
11 
T The substratum in 
which cognition inheres is the 
soul (dltnan).It is of two
kinds the supreme Soul and
the individual soul. Of these 
tv\o, tlie supreme Soul is one
and is the omniscient Lord. 
The individual soul, on the other 
hand, is different in association 
with different organisms or
bodies, though it is all-pervasive 
and eternal. 
12 
T Mind (manas) is the 
sense by means of which plea 
sure and such other (perceptible 
qualities of the soul)are direct-CH.I] PERCEPTION 75   
ly apprehended. There are 
innumerable minds (manamsi),. 
since they are specifically linked 
up with each soul and they are 
atomic and eternal. 
Atvicui (soul)is the substratum in which know ledge inheres. This definition is quite adequate to indicate that the soul is a substance (</nrrw/) and to differentiate it from other substances. One's ownsotd or self is, ;. v v : lii j to N)fiya, revealed in one's inner perceptual experience arising through the inner sense of mind, independently of the external senses,. i.e., in one's nianasa-pralyaksa which takes the forms
'I know', 'I will1,'1 feel', 4 wish' ('ahain jan ami', 'aluvn yale',l aham sukhi', 'aliam icchumi').It should be noted that, even in such inner experiences, it is never presented by itself, but it is presented only as the substratum of knowledge or consciousness (;fla//a) t volitional effort (krliyatna), pleasure and pain (sukha, duhkha) and desire (taVm). For this reason,, the Naiyayikas hold that one's own soul or self is revealed in mental perception (in anasapratyaksa}, only in association with one or the other of its perceptible 
special qualities (yoyyaviscsayunayoycnaiva'). It is believed by some that the Vaisesikas hold that dtman is imperceptible and that they differ from the Naiyayikas in this respect. The authority of Kanada's sutra VIII
2 (tatratma manatcapratyakse} is also invoked in this connection. Prasastapada also seems to support this view in his statement that, though dtman is subtle
76 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
and imperceptible, he is inferred as the conscious agentwho uses the senses as instruments in producing cogni tions : Cf. 
11 Tasya sauksmyat apratyaksalvc'pi karanaih sabdddyupalabdhyamtniitaih srotrddibhih somadhi-(jamah kriyate" (PrasastapddabhdsyaViz. S. S. page 69). This belief is based on a misapprehensionwhich threatens to become a permanent feature of manyan English treatise dealing with Indian logic. Thefact, however, seems to be that both Kanada (Cf. Vais. Su. Ill ii 9 and 10) and Prasastapada (Cf. Bhtisya Viz. S. S., pages 70 187) admit that one's own dtwan is revealed in one's own mental perception. Sridhara also draws attention to this in his Randall(Viz. S. S. page 71) when he observes that, thoughdtman is directly perceived by the wanas, as agent or owner through association with the body and senses with which he came to be invested as a result of his own deeds, yet imperceptibility (atyratyaksatva) happensto be predicated with reference to &tmant merely in view of the soul fallingoutside therange of the external senses. The leading exponents of the Nyaya-Vaisesikasystem are, however, agreed that one person's soul cannot be perceived by the nianas of another person andthat, even in the case of one's own soul, mental percep tion (mdnasapratyksa)is misleading since it often lumps up dtman and body into one jumble. For this reason, in order to prove the existence of soul as a distinct entity and to differentiate it from the body,the senses, the vital airs and such other things,it would
CH. i] PERCEPTION 77be necessary to resort to inference. Two typical argu ments adduced by the Vaisesikas and Naiyayikas in this connection are worthy of consideration. From the movement of a chariot, one ordinarily infers the pres ence of a charioteer who drives it; even so, one infers an individual soul who drives a body, from its various activities. Knowledge and such other qualities, nor mally perceived only by the inner sense manas, require an intimately related substratum in v\hich they inhere, for the reason that qualities invariably inhere in subs tances; all other substances being eliminated, a distinct substance, in which knowledge and such other qualities inhere, should be recognised; and that substance is called dtman. Since individual experiences vary in a definite manner, the individual dtman associated withone body should be taken to be different from the individual dtinan associated with another body. Atthe same time, in order to account for remembrance of previous experiences and for the first instinctive effort which a new-born baby, immediately after its birth, puts forth to preserveits life by means of the usual suck, it would be necessary to assume that every indivi dual soul is permanent and eternal. It is an accepted principle that everybody reaps as he sows and never reaps what he does not sow; and in order to avoid conflict with this principle,it would be necessary to ascribe to every jii'a, pre-natal existence and persistence after death. The soul cannot be atomic in size; for, cognition and such other special qualities are perceived by the inner sense manas, while the qualities of atomscan never be perceived. Nor can the soul be of medium  
78 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
size (madhyamaparimana); for, anything which hasthe size called mahattva (largeness) and which is not all-pervasive (vibhn), is non-eternal and therefore comes to an end; but Citman cannot come to an end as already explained. On these grounds, the N"ya)a-Vai sesika system maintains that there are innumerablesouls and every dtman is eternal (w/va)and all-perva sive (vibhn). Though the soul is present everywhere,consiousness and other special qualities attributed to it are produced within the sphere delimited by body(sarira) ;and this is the reason why body is described as the field of titman's experience (at memo bhogtiya tanam sariram). 
According to Nyaya, dtman is of two kinds the individual soul (jlva) and the supreme Suul (paramat jmw). Fourteen qualities are ascribed to the former vis.: number, size, contact, disjunction, separateness, cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, dislike, volitional effort, merit, demerit and reminiscent impressions; andeight qualities are ascribed to the latter viz. ; number,
size, contact, disjunction, separateness, cognition, desire, and volitional effort. The Naiyayikas accept the supreme authority and infallibility of revealed texts (sruti) and recognise, on the authority of those texts, 
the existence of omnipotent and omniscient God. Heshould be brought under the class of substances called dtman, for the reason that he is the intimate substratum 
(samavayiii) of eternal knowledge. With a view to removing such doubts, misapprehensions and difficulties as may arise in this connection, the Naiyayikas seek to
CH.I] PERCEPTION 79   
support their theistic doctrine, ultimately based on by means of syllogistic arguments. Udayanacarya of the tenth century A. D., who is the greatest champion of STyaya theism, suggests no less than eight syllogistic arguments in supportof the Xyaya view that the whole creation is made by God who is omniscient, omnipotent and eternal. Earth and such other products (karya] constituting the created world should have been created by a conscious agent having a full and definite know ledge of all the details relating to the required causal apparatus; and such an agent in the case of the whole creation cannot conceivably be a jlva (individual soul) and should therefore be the supreme Soul (Paramutman
Isvara). At the beginning of creation (vr$/i), the volitional effort (yt atna) leading to the concretive activity (dyojana), which produced contact between two atoms, should be taken to inhere in a conscious being; and the concious being cannot be jlva andshould be Isvara. The various planets are sustained in their position and do not sink down or dash against each other; this should be due to the sustaining effort (dhrii) of some conscious being, who is Isvara. Theintelligent being, who is originally responsible for the first introduction (pada)into the world of certain indispensable crafts and arts like weaving and pot making, cannot be jlva and should be taken to be Isvara. The infallibility of the Vedas depends on the unfailing validity of the knowledge derived from them;that knowledge is always valid on account of the eternal purity of the source from which the Vedasoriginated; and that source is the omniscient God. The
80 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
vedic texts consisting of sentences should have been composed by some intelligent author; and that authorof supreme intelligence is the omniscient God. Thenumber 'two' (dvitvasoriifchyd), belonging to twoatoms, is the cause of the size of dyads (dvyanuka} \ two and the higher numbers are all products resulting from the enumerative cognition (apcksdbuddhi)of the person who counts; and at the beginning of creation, such enumerative cognition could be attributed only to the omniscient God and to none else. All these eight arguments are summed up by Udayana in this verse (Kusumanjali V. 1): "Kdryayojanadhrtytideh padat pratyayatah sruteh; Vdkydt samkhydvisesdcca stidhya visvavidavyayah" 
it would be useful to compare the Nyaya viewof dtman with the corresponding theories in other systems of Indian philosophy. In the Sarhkhya-Yogasystem, there are innumerable souls (pnritsdh) andevery purusa is an unrelated, attributeless, self-lumi nous, eternal and omnipresent being who is identical with consciousness (cit). In the Yoga system, in addition to the ordinary pnrusa, God is recognised as a special type of purusa (purusavisesa'), who is not affected by any of the defects by which the ordinary purusa is affected and who is pre-eminently and eter nally omniscient and functions as the first teacher of all the ancient teachers. The Bhattas and Prabbakaras, for all ostensible purposes, banished God from their systen1,for fear lest the sovereign authority andsupreme pre-eminence of the Veda might be detracted from. The soul in the Bhatta system is the substratum
CH. i] PERCEPTION 81   
of consciousness and the object of inner perception (manasapratyaksa), though cognitionitself is only inferred and not perceived by the manas \ and in each 
body a different soul which is eternal and all-pervasive, is embodied. The Prabhfikaras also recognise differ ent, eternal and all-pervasive souls in different bodies; and the soul, however, is not the object of mentalperception (manasapratyaksa), according to their system. Expressions like 'I cognize myself (mamjdnami) are understood to refer to dtmau, not as the object (karma) of cognition, but merely as comingwithin the scope of cognition. The Prabhakara school holds that in every cognition, three factors are invari ably presented viz., the object (visaya),the soul as knower or the substratum of cognition (jfiata), andthe cognition itself (jnana-svarftpa). The followers of Sri Ramanuja and certain other Vaisnavas hold that the individual soul (jlva)is different in different bodies and is atomic in size (anuparimana). TheBauddha idealists would not recognise a permanentsoul and would reduce it to momentary consciousness (ksanikavijnana) ; while the Jaina realists would makethe soul commensurate with the body. The Advaitic monists hold that the individual soul (jiva), whichappears to vary in association with mind (antahkaraya) and to partake of the latter's vicissitudes, is in fact identical with the immutable and absolute reality called Brahman. 
Mind (manas) is described by the Naiyayikas as the inner sense which directly apprehends pleasure,
82 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
pain, cognition and such other perceptible qualities ofthe soul. To avoid confusion of one's experiences with those of another, it should be taken to be different in different individuals. On the ground that a percep tual experience can arise only through some sense (indriya) being brought into relation with what is per ceived, an inner sense (antarindriya) is inferred to account for the inner perception of pleasure, pain etc. One can have only one cognitionat a time; v :':., to the Naiyayikas, more than one cognition cannot arise simultaneously. This fact (yugapajjnananutpatti)is relied upon by Gautama as the chief argument to prove the existence of manas an an atomic substance. Aivnan is all-pervasive (vibhu) and comes into relation with all the senses and their objects at the same time. Howare we then to account for the fact that two or morecognitions never arise simultaneously but come into being one after another? This has to be explained through the assumption ot a substance which can comeinto relation with only one of the external senses at a time; and this substance is the atomic manas ({para manuparimanam manah). The Nyaya-Vaisesikasystem ascribes eight qualities to manas number,atomic size, separateness, contact, disjunction, remote ness, proximity and rapidity. The Prabhakaras agree with the Naiyayikas in the view that manas is an eternal atomic substance, but would not accept the view that dtman is the object of mental perception (manasa pratyaksa). The Bhattas maintain that manas is all pervasive and is in eternal contact with the all-perva sive fitman; that dtman and manas, in contact with
CH. i] PERCEPTION 83  
each other, function only within the sphere of the body(sarira) with which they happen to be associated; andthat our experience is inconclusive and cannot be said to be such as would rule out the possibility of several cognitions arising at the same time. The Advaitins regard antaliJtarana or the inner instrument of know ledge as a substance constituted by light (tejas) andmaintain that it is not a sense (indriya)in the strict sense of the term and that its modifications (vrttayah) may assume a cognitive,volitional or emotional formaccording as circumstances vary. 
The unswerving fidelity of the Naiyayikas to realism in a strict sense is mainly responsible for the somewhat extreme views which they have chosen to adopt in regard to atman and manas. It would appear that the fundamental distinction between spirit andmatter is either misled or ignored in the Nyaya theory which reduces atman to a mere substance and places it on a par with forms of dead matter like a stone, andwhich treats consciousness as a quality arisingin atmanunder certain conditions. The Nyaya realist, howeverf would point out that his theory of atman is free fromthe weak holes through which the idealistic inundation may sweep away everything, such as, for instance, a shrewd mind might easily notice in the Samkhya viewthat the soul (piirusa)is identical with the self-lumi nous consciousness. It should be remembered that the Naiyayikas have provided adequate safeguards against the materialist (carvaka) fraternising with them, in the facts that atman is always the seat of reminiscent
84 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
impressions (bhdvana),merit (dhafma) and demerit (adharma) till the moment of final release and that, even after final release, dtman is the seat of the annihi lation of all evils (dtyantikadiihkhadhvamsa) and not reduced to the form of an eternal stone, as some critics may fancy. Manas, in the Nyaya theory, is in no waybetter than any form of dead matter, except in respect of its fitness for a special kind of activity and of contact with atman\ and it is so in most of the other systems of Indian philosophy.It is, however, wherethe Nyaya theorist endeavours to maintain the eternity of dtman by making it all-pervasive (vibhu),that heallows himself to be tripped up by the Advaitic nionist, who would triumphantly draw attention to the ultimate merger which the recognition of innumerable all pervasive souls might inevitably result in. It is here that the Nyaya theory of dtman stands foredoomed. 
It is suggested by some writers that neither Kanada nor Gautama could be said to have intended to give a place in their systems to the conception ofGod. But it would be difficult to believe that Kanada,who believed in seers and the immense scope and capa city of their knowledge (drsajndna), did not believe in the existence of the omniscient God. There are goodreasons to believe that Gautama, who would ascribe the authorship of the Veda, to the Greatest Apia (truth speaker), took God for granted and that Uddyo takara, Vacaspatimisra and others were right in suggesting that the refutation of God's causality in the fourth chapter of Gautama's sutras shouldCH.I] PERCEPTION 85   
be understood to have reference to the relation of material cause (npaddnakdrana) and effect, and not to that of the agent, an instrumental cause (nimitta karana). It is also worthy of notice, in this connec tion, that the Nyaya theory of creationistic causa tion (dfambhavada) and the atomic theory wouldbe incomplete and unintelligible in certain respects, without explaining, as Udayana points out, the first concretive activities of pairs of atoms to form dyads, by attributing them to the volitional effort of the omni scient Creator, If the Naiyayikas had confined them selves to the creationistic argument to prove the existence of God, their God would be reduced to a 'demiurgic potter of the macrocosmic pot' (Brahmanda ktiiala). But luckily for the Nyaya theism, Udayana carya based many a theistic argument in his Kusumdn jali on the moral values recognised in the Hindusociety. In the history of Indian theism, that Udayana's theistic contribution is of particular value in demonstrating the extent to which theism may press reason into service where revelation fails, as in the case of anti-Vedic Buddhists, is a fact which every student of Nyaya should remember. It is this fact that emboldened Udayana to claim to be the saviour of the world's Saviour in the following verse which tradi tion attributes to Udayana : 
"Aisvaryamadamatto'si mdmavajndya vartase\ "Upasthitesii bauddhesu madadhind tava sthiiih\\" In Thy almighty power, inebriate thou art andthou dost not care for me. But Thy very existence depends upon me, when the Bauddhas approach.

cation of heat and are no
eternal. In the case of othe: 
substances, they are eternal ir 
such of them as are eternal am
they are not eternal in such oi 
them as are not eternal. 
The word 'only'in the definition of coloui excludes the sense of touch. Thus the definition amounts to this: that colour is quality which is per ceived in the normal way by the sense of vision anddoes not come within the range of the normal percep tion arising from the sense of touch. In this definition 
it is necessary to refer to 'normal visual perception*,
88 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
since even smell and such other qualities may, accord ing to the Naiyayikas, be brought within the range of the super-normal perception arising from the sense of vision. The word quality (ginia)in the definition is necessary and it excludes the jdti, colourness (rupalva), common to all the colours and the total negation of colour (riipdbhdva) ; for, a sense which peiceives an object perceives also its jdti and abhtiva under normalconditions and rnpatva and rufxlbhdva can thus be normally perceived by the sense of sight. The defini tion of colour, as explained above, is not satisfactory; it is applicable to contact between a ray of light and a wall (prabh&bhittisamyoya),the contact in such cases being visible, though not tangible. To obviate this ativydfiti, the definition of colour has to be modified in this manner: 'Colour has the differentia of a species of gunas, which is normally visible but not tangible'- 
(''Tvagagrahyacaksnryrahyagiuiavibhajakopadhimat").The definitions of taste, smell and touch set forth above have to be understood in a similar way. Thesepre-scientific classifications of colour and other qualities have only some historical and speculative interest. In the list of colours, the Naiyayikas have included the variegated colour (citrariipa) as a distinct variety. The reason why they have clone so is to be found in their theory of avayavin (composite structure), whichis ultimately attributable to their creationistic view of causation. In the Nyaya theory, a composite product (avayavin) is entirely different from its componentparts (avayava)',a cloth which is made up of threads of different colours, is seen as having a variegated
OH. i] PERCEPTION 89  
colour; the different colours belonging to the threads cannot be said to produce the corresponding colours in the single composite whole, for the reason that colour is a pervasive (vya^yavrtti) quality, unlike the non pervasive (avyapyavrtti) contact, which may be at oncepresent arid not present in a composite unit, and for the reason that one composite unit can thus have only onecolour; were it true that the cloth of variegated colour has no colour apart from those of the componentthreads, the composite cloth itself would be devoid ofany colour and would therefore become normally invi sible, visual perception ordinarily depending upon the presence of colour which is not sub-perceptional (amidbhfita) but perceptible (udbhuta) ; and on these grounds, in order to account for the visual perception of a variegated cloth,it becomes necessary to recognize variegated colour (citrarUpa)as a distinct variety of colour. In cases where a composite product is madeup of component parts having different tastes or different smells, the avayarin itself has no taste or smell and the different tastes or smells that may be perceived belong to the avayavas. In such cases, there is no necessity for postulating any distinct variety of taste or smell known as citrarasa (varied taste) or citragandha (varied smell). 
Colour, taste, smell and touch admit of change in earth through baking (pdka), which is explained by the Naiyayikas as amomiJiiix to contact of a special kind with fire (vijdtiyatcjassaniyoya). The Vaisesika theorists hold that, when a pot is baked or when a mango ripens through heat, the composite products get
90 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART ni   
disintegrated down to the stage of atoms; the qualities of colour, taste, smell and touch in those atoms are destroyed by heat; and a different colour, taste, smell and touch are produced ; and then integration takes 
place, new dyads, triads and other composite products being formed in accordance with the adrstas of the individual souls concerned with such products. Thistheory of pdka is known as pilvpakavuda or 'the theory of atoms being burnt'. The Nyaya theorists, on the other hand, hold that composite products are left intact in pdka and are not disintegrated and that their colour and such other qualities are replaced by corresponding qualities of different species. This theory of pakamaintained by the Naiyayikas is known as pitharafdka uada or 'the theory of composite wholes being burnt/ It should be remembered, in this connection, that in the Nyaya- Vaisesika system, earth is the only substance which admits of the special process of burning called pdka, though contact with fire is quite possiblein the case of any other substance.

T Number is the special 
cause of enumerative expres 
sions, such as one, two and so 
on. It is present in all the nine 
substances and it is represented 
by numbers beginning from
one and ending with parardha
(one thousand croresof crores). 
Number one may be everlasting
CH. i] PERCEPTION 91   
or non-eternal everlastingin 
everlasting substances and non 
eternal in non-eternal substances. 
Number two and the higher 
numbers are non-eternal every 
where. 
The -Nyaya-Vaisesika theory of 'number' is oneof the instances of the realistic excesses of the Nyaya Vaisesika ontology. Number is a quality (gitna) according to this system and is an objective reality. Number being a quality, how would the Nniyayikasaccount for propositions like 'there are twenty-four qualities' (catitrviiiisatirgnnah)? They would explain such propositions as referring to numbers co-existent with qualities in substances or as referring to the relation of objectness (visayata) between qualities andpeculiar type of cognition known as cninneratirc cognition (apeksdbnddhi). According to the Nyaya Vaisesika theory, two (dvitva) and the higher numbersare produced in the substances which are counted andcome within the scope of cnumerative cognition (apeksdbnddhi). Apeksdbnddhi in this system is the cognition involved in the process of counting and it takes the form 'This is one; this is one; and thus these are two' (ayam ekati, ayam ekah, dhatya, dvau). Though a cognition lasts only for two moments(ftsana) and comes to an end in the third moment fromits origin, apeksdbnddhi lasts three moments from its origin and comes to an end in the fourth moment.Why the exponents of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system
92 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
allow a longer lease of life to apeksabuddhi than to other varieties of cognition requires some explanation. Apeksabuddhi is the cause of 'two' (dvitva) and the 
higher numbers. If apeksabuddhi were to come to anend at the third moment from its origin, dvitva wouldcome to an end at the fourth moment of apeksabuddhi. Apeksabuddhi arises at a particular moment; at the next moment, dvitva arises, and may come into relation with an external sense say sight at that moment; the indeterminate perception of dvitvatva (dvitvatvanirvi kalpaka} conies into being at the third moment and the determinate perception of dvitva arises at the fourth moment; if apeksabuddhi were to come to an end at its third moment, dvitva would cease to exist at the fourth moment, when it is actually seen; and to say that a thing is seen at the moment at which it ceases to exist is obviously absurd. In order to avoid this absurd result, the Nyaya-Vaisesika hypothesis of apeksabuddlii allows to it a life of three moments, its end taking place at the fourth moment from its origin and being followed at its fifth moment by the end of dvitva, which continues to exist and comes to be seen at the fourth moment. In Nyaya terminology ekatva, dvitva and such other terms ordinarily denote number(samkltya). and may, in certain cases, denote the rela tion of being the object of a particular enumerativecognition (apeksabuddhi-visesa-visayatva). Ekatvamay also be taken occasionallyin a negative sense, when it is understood to mean uniqueness or 'being not seconded by another thing of the same species' (sva sajanyadvitiyarahityam).In Vaisesika treatises like
CH. i] PERCEPTION 95  
Sarhkaramisra's Sutropaskara, the process by whichapeksdbnddhi originates and functions is described thus: "The sense concerned conies into relation withthe thing in which dvitva is to be produced ; then the indeterminate perception of ekatvatva, common to all the numbers called ckatva, arises; then the co-ordinat ing group-cognition (satnulialaJiibana) of two units of ckatva arises; then dvitva itself comes into being; then the indeterminate perception of dv'Uvatva, the jati common to all the numbers called dvitva> arises; then follows the determinate perception of dvitva; then the two substances having dvitva are cognized; and lastly such a cognition produces the corresponding impres sion (saniskara) in the soul/' While ckatva is com pletely contained in a single container (pratyeka paryapta), dvitva and the higher numbers are partially contained (vyasajyarrtti)in each of the containers and completely contained only in groups of two andso on. 
The NySya conception of number more especially of two and the higher numbers as qualities inhering in substance may be described by the opponents of the Nyaya-Vaisesika realism and pluralism,as well as by the exponents of the modern school of Nyaya (navya ny&ya), as specimens of the warty overgrowths dis figuring the complexion of Nyaya realism. But shrewdcritics who can probe into the heart of Nyaya may be able to find in it an effective check to monistic thought which seeks to efface completely all the numbers andtheir metaphysical implications holding together the component parts of the social fabric.

T Size is the special cause 
of expressions pertainingto 
measurement. It is found in all 
the nine substances. It is of 
four kinds atomic, large, long 
and short.

T Separateness is the 
special cause of expressions 
such as 'this is separate from

T Contact is the special 
cause of expressions such as 
'these are in contact with each

substances.

T Disjunction is the 
quality which destroys contact. 
It is found in all the substances. 
23 
T Remoteness and proxi 
mity are the special causes of
expressions such as 'this is 
remote/ 'this is near'. They
are found in the four substancesCH. i] PERCEPTION 95   
beginning with earth and in 
Dianas. They are of two kinds, 
those that are due to time and
those due to space. In a remote
substance, spatial remoteness is 
found ; and in a substance lying 
near, spatial proximity is found. 
In an older person, temporal
remoteness is found; and in a 
younger person, temporal proxi 
mity is found. 
It will be seen that sections 18 to 21 and section 23in the text define number, size, contact, remoteness andproximity as special causes of the respective expressions which refer to them. The term vyavahdra is used in the text and is usually understood in the sense of'expression in words' or 'putting into words' (sabda prayoga). One cannot say 'this is one' (ayamckah)or 'this is large' (ayam mahdn), unless the thing referred to has the attribute connoted by the words'one' (cka) or large (niahat). By elimination, the attribute ekatva or mahattvatzn be shown to be distinct qualities. In the case of the expressions referred to* our experience enables us to establish the relation of causality between them and the qualities connoted bythe expressions used. God, time, space and adrsta (the unseen impressions resulting from good or baddeeds) are believed by the Naiyayikas to be commoncauses of all products; and to exclude these commoncauses (sadharanakarana) ,the phrase asadharana-
96 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
karana (special causes) is used in the definitions ofnumber, size, contact etc. All these definitions are based on the supposition that the expressions referred to are all correct and should be taken in their popularsense. 
In the Nyaya-Vaisesika system,the size of the atoms called tyQrimawdalya and the size of all-perva sive substances (vibhu") called paramawahativa are eternal. The cause which produces a size is the corres ponding size of the component parts, as in the case of all the degrees of mahattva above that of a triad andbelow that of an all-pervasive substance; or it is the number (sanikhya)of the component parts, as in the case of the sizes of a triad and a dyad; or it is loose contact (pracaya)of the component parts as in the case of a ball of cotton. The two sizes denoted by the words 'long* and *short' (dirghatva and hrasvatva) may well be brought under mahattva and anutva andneed not be recognised to be distinct varieties of size. 
The distinct position which separateness (prthak tva) occupies in the list of qualities recognised by the Vaisesikas is dependent chiefly upon the view that the experience embodied in the proposition 'A jar stands out separate from a cloth' (ghatah patat prthak)should be distinguished from the experience embodied in the proposition 'A jar is not a cloth' (ghatah pato na) and that the former should be interpreted as an affirmative proposition referring to the positive entity called prthaktva and the latter as a negative proposition refer ring to the negative category of reciprocal non-existence called anyonyabhava. Though the older Naiyayikas
CH. i] PERCEPTION 97  
support this view, some of the Naiyayikas like Raghu natha Siromani shrewdly see that this way of differ entiating prthaktva from anyonyabhava would only amount to the recognition of some useless distinction without any real difference and they discard prthaktvaalong with similar useless qualities like remoteness anddistance, which are merely temporal and spatial rela tions involving a larger or smaller number of interven ing contacts (Vide part III p. 14). 
It would be useful to refer again, in this connec tion, to the remarks at pages 51 and 52 of part III, about the Nyaya conception of contact (samyoga) as aquality and as an external relation possible only between two substances. The N)5,ya theorists wouldnot recognize contact between two all-pervasive sub stances. Contact may arise from activity (kriya) orfrom another contact. The latter variety is to befound in the contact which arises between one's bodytaken as a whole and a book, when the book is held in one's hand; and this variety of s\ii'ii\'oya called samyo gaja-samyoga is an inevitable result of the N}aya viewthat a composite whole (avayavin) is totally different from its component parts. The contact which arises whenone hits with force is called abhiyhata (striking) and it causes sound or some activity resulting in disjunction between the things joined by such contact; and a con tact which does not cause sound or does not cause someactivity of the kind described is called nodana (push ing). In the N>aya system, contact is a typical instance of a non-pervasive object (avyapyavrtti). Certain*
98 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
things are spatially non-pervasive (daisikavyfipyavrtti) ; for instance, contact with a monkey (kapisamftoga)is spatially non-pervasive in the sense that it may be said to be present and not present in the same tree at the same time, with reference to its top and foot. In a similar way, all the producible things (jdwyapaddrtha) are temporally non-pervasive in the sense that they maybe said to be present and not presentin undivided time (Wahakala) ,with reference to the periods preceding and following their production. Advanced students of Advaita may realise that the conception of avydpya vrttitva developed by the Naiyfiyikas is, indeed, used bythem as their life-belt when they have to save their realism from being drowned in the Advaitic deluge in which everythingother than the absolute Brahmansinks down to the level of mithyd (unreal) and turns out to be relativelyreal in the sense that it co-exists with its own non-existence. 
The Vaisesika theorists argue that disjunction (vibhtiga) should not be equated with the negation ofcontact in any form; and the older Naiyfiyikas support them. Disjunction cannot be the antecedent negation of contact (samyoga'prdgabhdra) ; for, in cases wherewe have the experience 'these are disunited' (imauvibhaktau}, we do not have the experience 'these will come into contact with each other' (imait samynktaul)havisyo>ia\i). Disjunction cannot be the total negation of contact (samyogdiyantdbhdva) ; for, in that case, one should have the experience 'these two qualities are disunited' (imau gunau vibhaktau), but one never has
CH.I] PERCMPTION 99   
such experience of vibhaga in the case of qualities. In every case of disjunction, one invariablyrealizes that contact is destroyed; but disjunction itself cannot be identified with loss of contact (samyoganasa}, for the 
reason that contact is also lost when one of the substan ces in contact with each other happens to be destroy ed and that, in such cases, one does not speak of dis junction (vibhaga}. Loss of contact between twosubstances which continue to exist has to be accounted for. It cannot be the direct result of discretive move ment (kriyd). For, in a case where a particular finger, as a result of its activity, comes into contact with a tree and the hand likewise comes into contact with the sametree as a result of its movement, the linger may be moved away from the tree and thus lose its contact with the tiee; in that case, one speaks of the hand also losing contact with the same tree; the movement of tiie finger may cause the loss of contact between the finger and the tree; and this movement does not belong to the hand and cannot, theiefore, have anything to do with the loss of contact between the hand and the tree. In such instances, the loss of ? a;;, \otja should be attributed to a cause other than movement (karma) and this cause is called vibhaga or disjunction. By a process of elimination, disjunction is brought under the category called guna. This argument set forth by the Vaisesikas to maintain that vibhaga is a distinct quality involves many an assumption which canLot be satisfactorily sustained. The later Naiyayikas realize the weakpoints in this argument and bring vibhaga under loss ofcontact (sathyoganasa).

The qualities mentioned above, viz. number,size, separateness, contact, disjunction, remotenessand proximity, and fluidity and viscidity are capable, of being perceived by two of the external senses the sight and the touch. Sections 25 and 26 in the following text deal with fluidity and viscidity. 24 
T Weight is the non-inti 
mate cause of the first downward
motion (of a falling substance) 
It is found in earth and water. 
25 
T Fluidity is the non-inti 
mate cause of the first flow (of
a fluid substance).It is found
in earth, water and light.It is 
of two kinds natuial fluidity 
and artificial fluidity. Natural
fluidityis found in water. Arti 
ficial fluidityis found in earth 
and light. In certain varieties 
of earth like ghee, etc., fluidity 
of the artificial variety is 
brought about through contact 
with fire; and it is also found in 
gold and such other varieties of
light. 
26 
T Viscidity is the quality 
which causes the lumping up of
H. i] PERCEPTION 101   
powder etc., i.e. the particles 
of powder, etc., to adhere to each 
other. It belongs only to water. 
The above definitions of gurutva, dravatva andsneha have hardly any scientific value and they are based wholly on speculation resting upon certain popular notions. 'It should be noted that gurutva (weight)* according to Nyaya theorists, is beyond the range of 
sense-perception (atindriya). The Naiyayikas main tain that, though oil and such other substances appear to have viscidity (sneha), it really belongs to water which forms part of those substances. 
27 
T Sound is a quality 
which is perceived by the ear. It 
belongs only to the ether. It is 
of two kinds viz., noise and
alphabetic sound. Noise is found
in a drum and alphabetic sounds 
form languages like Sanskrit. 
The Nyaya-Vaisesika theorists <li*!iiinnMi between inarticulate noise called dhvani and articulate alpha betic sounds called varna. They further distinguish three varieties of sounds, in view of the three kinds of causes which may produce them. These three varieties are: (1) the sound caused by contact (samyogaja), (2) the sound caused by disjunction (vibhagaja), and(3) the sound caused by another sound itself (sabdaja). The first variety arises when a drum is beaten by a .stick; the second variety arises when a bamboo is split;
102 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
and the third variety is to be found in the series ofsounds successively arising in the akasa intervening between a drum, for instance, and the sense of hearing* In Indian philosophy, a considerable measure of specu lative value is attached to the N>aya theory of sabdaja sabda or series of successive and exactly similar soundsarising in a continuous chain, beginning with the first sound caused in the portion of ether delimited by the substance that is struck, such as a drum, and ending with the last sound that is caused in the portion of ether representingthe sense of hearing and is actually heard. The Naiyayikas explain the way in which a sound-series is producedin auditory perception, bymeans of two illustrations vis., the illustration of 'little wave and big wave* (vlcitaranganyuya) and the illustration of kadamba buds. These two illustrations suggest two ways of i \;>1, lining how a sound comes to be heard on all sides and in all the ten directions, in cluding the intermediate points and up and down. Alittle circular wave springs up; around it a bigger wavearises; around it a still bigger wave and so on; in this way, a circular wave of sound is caused, around it a bigger sound-wave and so on, until at last a certain sound-wave is produced in such a way that it reaches the senses of hearing which may be fit and ready to hear in all the ten directions. In this explanation, there is only one series consisting of several circular sound waves, each coming into relation with all the ten direc tions. One kadamba filament which first shoots up, causes several kadamba filaments to shoot up simul taneously in all the parts of a kadamba flower; in the
CH. i] PERCEPTION 103   
same way, the first sound, produced at some point, causes ten sounds to spring up simultaneously in all the ten directions; and they cause ten other sounds to spring up in all the ten directions and so on; and thus the sound in question comes to he heard on all sides. In
this explanation, the series of sabdaja-Sabdas consists of several groups of sounds, each group being taken to be a ten. In the illustration of kadamba bud, it should 
be remembered that each bud-like filament of a kadambQflower is described as a bud in the phrases kadamba mukulanydya and Jtadambakorakanyaya. The expla nation suggested by the second illustration is consider ed unsatisfactory and cumbrous. 
The Bhattas and Prabhakaras hold that alphabetic or articulate sounds (varnatmakasabda) are eternal. The former maintain that varna is an all-pervasive eternal substance (nityam vibhu dravyam} ; while the latter hold that varna is an eternal quality (n'ityaguna}. The Mimariisakas seek to support their view that varnais eternal by referring to the recognition which we are conscious of in the case of the same varna and whichtakes a form like this: 'This sound g which I nowhear is the same as that g which I heard several times before' (So'yam gakarah). One can easilysee the reason why the Mimarnsakas are particularly solicitous to maintain the theory of the eternity of varnas if oneremembers that the Mimamsa theory of the eternity of the Vedas rests upon 'the eternity of varnas. TheVaiyakaranas hold that the transcendental substratum of varnas called sphota is real and permanent and that
.104 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
varnas themselves are not permanent. The Nyaya Vaisesika system maintains that every varna is causedand the Vedas themselves were produced by God, the recognition of the same varna like 'This g is that* (So'yam gakdrah) being interpreted as referring to the 
permanent jati called gatva and not to the same#-sound (ga-vyakti).

Buddhi is an ambiguous term and it is used in various senses in Sanskrit philosophical literature. Sometimes it is used in the sense of antahkarana the inner organ of knowledge. It is also used in the sense of determination (niscaya), which is an aspect or modification of antahkarana, according to the Sariikhyas and Advaitins: and the connected wordsmail and manas are contrasted with buddhi in this sense, the word matt being used in the sense of imagi nation or imaginative cognition of something yet to come about (ii:a!inlffm(linijoc{ inl) and the word manasin the sense of a dubitative activity of antahkaranawhich corresponds to doubt (vimarsdlmakam nianah). The Naiyayikas are quite consistent and definite in their use of the term budrthi, and they always take it to be synonymous with matt, upalabdhi and jndna; andthey take manas to be equivalentto antahkarana. 
In the text, Annambhatta's definition of buddhican be explained in two ways. The former part of the text sarvavyavyharaheiuh may be taken to form
106 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
the definition with the addition of the word guna(quality) and the tei m jnana in the text maybe under stood as merely emphasizing the idea that there is no
difference between jnana (knowledge) and buddhi(cognition). Or the latter part of the text jnanambuddhih may be taken to constitute a satisfactory definition of buddhi and may also be understood as incidentally emphasizing the idea that buddhi and jnanaare identical. According to the first explanation, the definition of buddhi amounts to this "Cognitionor knowledge is a quality which is the cause of all inter communication through language/' As the oft-quoted dictum 'artham buddhva sabdaracawa" puts it, collo cation of suitable words always follows ideas of things; and from this point of view, it is obvious that cogni tion is the invariable and indispensable antecedent of intercommunication through speech. But this mode of defining cognition is defective for the reason that it does not cover cases of a peculiar type of cognition called indeterminate cognition (nirvikalpakajfiana), which does not involve any kind of relation and whichcan only be inferred and can never be embodied in anyproposition. Nirvikalpakajnanais called avyapadesyaand it does not admit of being embodied in words; so, it cannot be regarded as the cause of intercommunica tion through expression; and thus the definition "sarvavyavahdrahctuli' is vitiated by the defect ofavyapti (partial inapplicability or narrowness).In order to remove this defect, the usual device of j&ti ghatitalaksana is resorted to and the scope of the defi nition is increased in this modified form "Knowledge
CH. i] PERCEPTION 107   
or cognition has a jati which is not found in colour andsuch other qualities and which is co-existent with the causality of intercommunication through speech". This is indeed a clumsy definition. Annambhatta him self sees this and suggestsin his Dipika that the formerpart of the text "sarvavyarahdruhctith'9may be taken to be merely explanatory and the latter part "jfianam buddhih" as the definition. In the Dipika, Annam bhatta says "Janamityannvyavasuyayaviyam jnanatva meva laksanam iti bhdvah." Thus ;icccnliiii: to him, Indnatva (cogniticnness), which is the generic attribute (jati) ^\ , , i :'.. , all cognitions, is the distinctive feature (asddhdranadharma)of cognition. He also suggests that the jdtil called jnanatva, is arrived at through the uniform experience of a cognition whichinvariably assumes a form like this 'I cognise a jar* (yhat am aham janami), or 'I cognise a cloth' ('pat amahatu jdwami). In such cases, the speaker is awareof the fact that he is cognising ajar; or,in other words, he has the anuvyavasaya of his vyavasaya9 \i\s cognition of a jar being called vyavasaya and his awareness or consciousness of snch cognition being called anuvyavasaya. It is only by a-Miming a generic attribute (jati), called jnanatva, as the commoncharacteristic of all cognitions, that the uniformity in the anuvyavasaya referred to can be satisfactorily accounted for. And this jati may, with advantage, be taken to represent the distinctive feature of cognition. 
The phrase jnanam buddhih9,in the text underconsideration is also to be understood as implying a refutation of the Sarhkhya view that buddhi, upalabdhi
108 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
and jnana denote different things. In 1 1 15, Gautama, the author of the Nyaya-sutras, says that the terms buddhi (cognition), upalabdhi (apprehension), and jnana (knowledge) should be understood to signify 
-the same thing ( buddhirupalabdhirjhanamiiyanar thdntaram). Vatsyayana, Vacaspati and Udayanainterpret this sutra as refutingthe Sarhkhya- view that these three terms denote entirely different things. In the Sarhkhya system, the term buddhi stands for the first evolute called inahattattva, the etymological mean ing of the word buddhi being that which first springs up (V &wd/*=V ndbudh=io spring up) and that of the word jHoAaf being that which grows out of, and into something else (\/ uiah=to grow or evolve). Thisprinciple called bnddhi is the first evolute evolved out of the primordial matter, called mfilaprakrti, and is, in itself, but a form of dead matter. However, throughproximity to the self-luminous consciousness (cit), called purusa, the mateiial evolute, buddhi, comes to be enlivened, as it were, by consciousness (cailanya) andundergoes various transformations, of which one of the most important is called adhyavasaya (determinative cognition). Adhyavasaya, in the Sarhkhya sense, usually takes the form "This should be done by me"(idam kartavyam maya). The Samkhyas describe buddhi, in its adhyavasaya phase, as consisting of three constituent factors (amsaftayavati buddhih). Thesethree factors are the eyoic element (madamsah), the element of voluntary decision (kartavyamiti vyaparam sah), and the objective element of this* (idaniamsah).
CH. i] PERCEPTION   
The egoic element or madamsa, in the Sarbkhya termi nology, is said to represent what is called punisoparaga, which is an unreal element cor. -I'M inn in the reflection of the absolutely passive and self-luminous cit called purusa, in the reflectory, mirror-like, matter called buddhi^ or which is the result of the erroneous identification of purusa with buddlri. The element of voluntary decision is a real 'factor and representsa real modification of buddhi. The objective element of 'this' (idawamsah),is but an objective modification of buddhi unfoldingitself through the sense-organs; and this element is known as knowledge or cognition (jnana} and is real. Apprehension or upalabdhi is the relation between the objective factor, called visayoparagaand represented byidamaihsa and equated with jfiana, on the one hand,and the absolute purusa, on the other; and upalabdhi is thus an unreal factor, for the reason that purusa, ac cording to the Samkbyas, cannot be conceived of as having any real relation. The well-known illustration of a mirror being held before a person's face is used in this connection by the Sarhkhyas to explain these dis tinctions. When a mirror is held before the face of a person, the reflection of the face is seen through the mirror. If that person happens to breath out on the surface of the mirror, the surface looks dim and the re flected image of the face also looks dim. One mayfancy, in these circumstances, that the face also is dim.In this illustration, the dimness caused on the surface of the mirror is real and the fancied relation betweenthis dimness and the face itself that is reflected in the mirror is unreal. Similarly, jndna which is the cogni-
110 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PARTIH  
live modification of the first e volute (buddhi),is a real factor; and it conies to have a false relation with puru sa through his reflection in buddhi, in the sameway as the dimness of the mirror comes to have a false relation with the real face through its reflection. Thisfalse relation is called upalabdhi (apprehension).It will be seen that, in the Sarhkhya theory, jnCma is entirely material in its nature and origin and becomesapparently spiritualised to some extent when it comesto have a false relation with purusa,', and this false relation with the spiritis called upalabdhi and is presented in experiences like 'I apprehend' (ahamupalabhc). The Naiyayikas contend that the sub stratum of voluntary decision (krti) ought to be regard ed as the substratum also of knowledge or cognition (jndna) which there is hardly adequate reason to distin guish from consciousness (cailanya)or apprehension (upalabdhi). This contention is embodied in Gautama'ssutra"uuddhirupalabdhirjildnaniityanarthdntaram"; and students of Nyaya, are reminded of the view embo died in this sutra, when they consider Annambhatta'sstatement jntinam bnddhih ". 
Cognition is first divided into two main headsrecollection (smrti) and experience (anubhava).Annambhatta defines recollection as a cognition caused solely by impressions. The impressions referred to here are reminiscent impressions (bhdvand) derived from prior cognitions. In this definition, the word'solely' (jndtra)is intended to exclude recognition (pratyabhijnd), which is a perceptual experience (pratyaksa) arising through the relation of a sense-
CH.X] PERCEPTION 111   
organ with some object (indriydrt/iasarnikarsa) andthrough reminiscent impressions derived from a prior cognition of the same object. 'This is that person* 
(so'yam purusdh) : cognitions of this type are ins tances of recognition and should not be confoundedwith cases of recollection. {While the Advaitins andBhattas would explain riTngnitinn (pralyabhijfiu)as a cognitive complex consisting of two parts, one repre senting perceptual experience (pratyaksa) and the other recollection (smarana), the Naiyayikas, as champions of consistency, would not accept such explanations and would banish from their world all such centaurian and monstrous complexes. Thus, in the N}fiya theory, it has become necessary to bring recog nition under perceptual experience of a special type and to exclude it from the scope of the definition of recollection (swrti). The Nyaya theory of smrtt is that certain kinds of cognition, which are different fromindifference (upeksd), invariably leave reminiscent impressions (bhuvanaritpasawskara)in at man and that these impressions are kindled up under certain condi tions and cause recollection. Every group of reminis cent impressions causing a recollection comes to an endimmediately after its effect is produced. But this would not mean that after once recollecting ><>;:, i ihing, it would no longer be possible to recall it again to memory; for, every recollection would, in its turn, cause a reminiscent impression. Thus, according to the older Nyaya theory, every recollection, even whenit relates to the same object,is caused by a different set of reminiscent impressions. Later Naiyyikas and
112 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
Advaitins, on the other hand, hold that the recollections of the same object are all produced by the same set of reminiscent impressions, which merely acquire enhancedintensity through every recollection. Cognitions whichadmit of being reproduced in memory through reminis cent impressions are classified under three heads by the Vaisesikas and Naiyayikas of the older school: patupratyaya, abhyCisapratyaya and adarapraiyaya. The normal type of cognition which involves the mini mum degree of attention sufficient to ensure reprodu cation in memory is called 'vivid cognition' (patupra tyaya}. By repeatedly revolving a certain idea in one's mind, one comes to have what may be called 'repeti tional cognition' (abhyasapratyaya}. When one's mindgets riveted to a wonderful or extraordinary object, the cognition that arises is known as 'regardful cogni tion' (adarapratyaya}.All the cognitions other than recollection (stnrti) are technically known as anubhava*This technical use of the term unubhava is common in sfistraic literature and it has to be rendered by the English equivalent 'experience'. In its technical sense, as used in Nyaya-Vaisesika literature, it may denote any kind of experience direct or indirect, perceptual (pratyaksika), or inferential (anuw&nika), or verbal (s&bda). In some places, the word anubhava is somewhat loosely used in the sense of direct experience or direct realization. Students of Nyaya should take care to avoid confusion between these two uses of word anubhava. 
Anubhava is divided in Nyaya literature into real (yathartha) and unreal (ayathartha). The first variety
CH.I] PERCEPTION US  
is also called pram& and the second variety is also called bhrama. The etymology of the term pramd drawsattention to the fact that the experience denoted by that term is sound or valid, as the prefix pro, indicates. Theetymology of the term bhrama draws attention to the fact that the thinker's mind goes astray in every case of erroneous experience. The term yathartha meansexactly corresponding to the object; and the definition of valid experience, that it cognises an attribute as belonging to an object which really has it, is directly based on the meaning of the term yathdrtha; andlikewise, the definition of erroneous experience, that it cognizes an attribute as belonging to an object which,, in fact, does not have it, is based on the meaning of the term ayathartha. To cognize a piece of silver lying before one as a piece of silver (purovartini rajate 'idam rajatam9iti pratltih)is valid experience; and to cognize a shell, or mother of pearl, or nacre as it is called, as a piece of silver (hiktau 'idam rajatam9iti prat) tih) is erroneous experience. 
In order to understand correctly the definitions ofvalid and erroneous experiences, as given in the text, it is necessary to acquire some knowledge of the termi nology by which the Naiyayikas indicate the content of a cognition, with a measure of quantitative precision which is nor ordinarily achieved through English ex pression. Every determinate experience involves anobjective complex as representing its objective con tent. The objective content of cognition is called visaya (objective) ; the cognitionitself is known asvisayvi (subject) ; and the relation between a cognition 8
114 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
and its object is known as visayavisayibhdva (subject object-relation). In the Nya>a-Vaisesika system, this is conceived of as an external relation between twodistinct relata which are two realities connected with each other for the time being. The problem of the relation between the subject (visayin=jndna) andobject (visaya) is solved by the Naiyayikas in this way. Objects like a jar or a piece of cloth exist out side the sphere of cognition (jiiana)as realities inde pendent of cognition. Through visayata (objectness), which is a kind of self-linking relation (svarupasam bandha) and is merely a phase of the object cognized, an object comes into relation with cognition, which hasthe correlated counterpart of visayaid known as visayitd (subjectness). Visayitd is also a kind of self-linking relation and is merely a phase of the visayin which cognizes. The Nauayikas hold that, while several realities n ay exi.st independently of cog nition, the latter never exists independently of, and as dissociated from, the objects that arc cu:;ni/id ; and this is regarded by the N)fi\a theorists "s a state of things fatal to idealism. They forget, however, that their realism ultimately rests upon experience and what is relied upon as the only guarantee of the objective rea lity of the external world is the content or form whichis involved in experience, and which idealism or sub jectivism can easily merge in cognition. 
The Nyava relation of visayavisayibhava involves two correlated parts known as visayaid (objectness) and visayitd (subjectness) and the correlation of these two parts is denoted by the word nirupita. TheCH.I] PERCEPTION 113   
objective content of a ^ determinate cognition or judg ment is constituled by three parts, vis., the principal or leading concept called viscsya (substantive), one or more subordinate concepts called visesana or prak&ra 
(adjunct), and a relation (samsarga^ connecting the visesana and visesya. These three parts form the complex object (z'isaya) of a judgment; the aspect of visayatd which belongs to the viscsyais called viscsyatd 
(substantiveness) ; that which belongs to the visesanais called viscsanatd (adjunctness) ; and that whichbelongs to samsarya is called .^(uii^arijatC: (relation ness). In ihe judgment 'the cloth is red* (raklah 
patah), cloth i-> the visesya, red col ur is presented as the visesana, and the relation between the redness andcloth is inherence (samavtiya) and that is presented as the samsarya. The visayatd which belongs to these three things is presentedin three forms, viz., viscsyata, visesanatd or prakarata and samsaryatd. These three aspects of visayatd are correlated to each other and to the visayita (subjectness) which belongs to the cogni tion in which they are presented. The correlation of these factois is expressed in Sanskrit by the symbolic terms nirupaka and ninlpya. The boundary of each of the objective factors is exactly defined bya reference to the delimiting feature which is also presented in the cognition under consideration. In the example referred to, cloth is presented as visesya, not under the aspect of dravyatva (substanceness), but amder the specific aspect of patatva (clothness) ; red colour is presented as vUesana or prakdra, not under the aspect of gunytva.{qqalityness), but Under the specific jaspect of raktatva
116 A PKIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
(red-colourness) ; and samavayo (inherence)is pre sented as samsarga, not under the aspect of samban dhotva (relationness), but under the specific aspect of samavayatva (inherenceness). The required specifi cations in these cases are made by referring to patatva, raktatvanml samavayatva as the delimiting adjuncts (avacchedaka) respectively of the viscsyata in the cloth, the prakaratain the red-colour and the samsar gatd in inherence. Thus by a clever use of the terms avacchedaka (delimiting), ayacchedya or avacchinna(delimited), and nirupaka or nirupila (correlating or correlated), in the instance taken for illustration,. viz., the judgment 'raktah patah' (the cloth is red), the objective content may be described in the following way, with a considerable measure of quantitative pre cision : "It is a ((/Bullion whose visayita (subject ness) is correlated to the viscsyata (substantiveness) delimited by clothness (patatva), the viscsyata in its turn being correlated to the prakarata (adjunctness) delimited by red-colourness (rakta-rapatva), and the sariisargata (relationness)correlated to the said praka rata and viscsyat& being delimited by inherenceness (samavayatva). The Sanskrit expression whichexactly describes the objective content of the judgment, the cloth is red* (raktah patah), may be set forth thus :"raktatvdvacchinnaprakaratanirupita patatva vacchinnaviSesyataniriipita samavayatvavacchinna samsargatanifupita visayitat&li jndtiam". In this waythe disposition of the component factors of the objec tive content of a cognition is exactly indicated bymeans of the symbolic words avacchedaka and
CH. i] PERCEPTION 117   
The definitions of ffama and bhrama, as givenin the text, are somewhat defective, since they do not indicate correctly the correlation between the visesyatd andprakdratd. In the definition of pramd, for instance, as given in the text, the substantive having a certain attribute is referred to as viscsya and the particular attribute as prakdra. This amounts to saying that in Pramd, if silverness is presented as prakdra, silver having silverness (rajatatva) in it is also presentedas vtiesya. Though, for all practical purpose?,this looks like a correct definition of pramd, it would break clown when considered in the light of certain group-cogni tions (samiihdlambana), in winch two or more sub stantival factors (visesya)are presented as co-ordinate objects associated witli certain adjuncts. Nacre and silver (sukti and rajata) may both be presentin a cer tain place; a gioup-cognition, which at once mistakes nacre f >r silver and silver for nacre, may arise; it is a sajnuhdlambanabhraina which takes the form. ''These are silver and nacre" (ime rajatasitkti) ; the definition of pramd as given in the text would be applicableto this case of bhrama for the reason that silverness (rajatatva) and nacreness (suktitva) are presented as attributes (prakdra) and the two things, nacre and silver, which really have the two attributes mentioned, are presented as leading concepts (visesya). There is nothing in the definition of pramd, as given in the text, which would exclude such cases of samuhalambana bhrama. To exclude such cases, it is necessary to point out that the adjunctness (prakdratd) of the attribute presented in a valid cognition is correlated with the
118 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
substantiveness (visesyata) of the thing really having that attribute. In the erroneous group-cognition (sannl halambana) above referred to, the substantiveness of nacre is not rightly correlated with the adjunctness of nacreness but wrongly correlated with the adjunctness of silverness; and similarly the adjunctness of nacreness and the substantiveness of silverness are wrongly correlated with each other. A correct des cription of this erroneous group-cognitionin accord ance with the technical terminology of the Nai^ayikas would facilitate a correct appreciation of these remarks. This samuhalambana may be described thus in Sanskrit: 
"rajatatvanistha-prakaratdnirupita- sukiinistha- vi sesyata ckd, suktitvanistha-prakarataniriipita-rajatonis thaviscsyatd apara, etddrsavisesy itadva\anirupita-visa yitasdli 'ime suktirajate' iti saniuh&lanibanam." 
Thus it will be seen that the correct and complete definition of prama or valid cognition is that it is a cognition in which the thingthat is presentedas sub stantive (v sesya) has the attribute which is presented as adjunct (prakara) and the substantiveness (vife syatd) of the former is presented as correlated with the adjunctness (prakdratd)of the latter. For a similar reason, the definition of bhrama, as givenin the text, should be amplified with a view to securing greater precision. A bhrama is an erroneous cognition in which the thing that is presented as substantive (visesya) does not have the attribute presented as adjunct (Prak&ra), though the substantiveness (visesyata) of the former is presented as correlated
CH.I] PERCEPTION 119   
with the adjunctness (praktiratd) of the latter. Thisdefinition would he applicableto cases of erroneouscognition like 'this is silver* (idam rajatam), wherenacre is mistaken for silver; and it also excludes cases of valid group-cognition (sawuhalambanaprama) like 'these are silver and nacre* (imc rajatasuktl), whereboth silver and nacre are seen as such and not con founded with each other. 
In this connection, it is desirahle to say a fewwords ahout the way in which the Nyaya theorist solves the problem of knowledge and the connected questions of truth and error. The realism of Nyaya,which recognizes complete difference (bheda) betweenthe object (visaya) and subject (visayin) or betweenthe known object (jncya} and the cognizing knowledge(jnana) lias inevitably to face UK* piobiemof truth anderror and to suggest some solution which may be con sistent with the Nyaya theory. If the jneya should bewholly different f rom jnuna, lu w is the gulf betweenthese two real factors to be bridged over, seeing that they are fundamentally different? How is knowledgepossible at all? Knowledge is a real factor and its object is also a real factor existing independently of knowledge. To a Naiyayika,esse can never be pcrcipi. If it is the nature of knowledge, as the Naiyayikacon tends, to come into relation with a real object existing outside knowledge, what is it that bridges overthe gulf between these two factors? The Nyayatheorist who recognizes a scheme of external relations finds it easy to point out that through the self-linking
120 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
relation (svarupasambandha) of subject and object (visayavisayibhava} 9 the cogipzid reality (jfieya) andthe cognizing reality (jfiawa) cnn Le brought together. The secret of the N\aya conception of svariipasam Sandha is that relation is but a phase of reality andevery real object involves that phase. From the N>ayapoint of view, it is perfectly inuiii^ihlc that knowledgeis knowledge of a real object external to it and is not simply knowledge of ideas which are only copies of ob jects. It is one of the advantages of the Nyaya concep tion of relation being wholly external that the Naiya 
yikas can account for cognition without the mediation of ideas as idealists and subjectivists find it necessary to do. So, in Nyaya epistcmology, it may be said that the Naiyayika has no difficulty in solving the problem of knowledge, the term knowledge being understood as 
cognition of objective reality, while there is real diffi culty in'for the difference between truth anderror, or valid cognition and erroneous cognition, con sistently with the realistic standpoint oi Nyaya meta physics, not to speak of the difficulties involved in the Nyaya theory of external relation. In a valid cognition like 'this is silver' (idam rajat am), where silver is seen correctly as silver, the Naiyayika contends that its objective content exactly corresponds to the external realities represented by the attribute 'silverness', the thing possessing that attribute, vis., silver, and their relation of inherence (samardya). It should be re membered here that according to N>aya epistemology, the objective content of a cognition is not contained in cognition but exists outside it and it is called 'content*
CH. i] PERCEPTION 121   
only in the sense that the relation of object and subject (visaya and visayin) connects it with jiidna. In a valid cognition, the exact correspondence betweenjnana and jncya, as already explained,consists in the correct correlation of the phases of visayavisayibhdva, viz., adjunctness (prakdratd), substantiveness (vise syatd) ai.id relationness (samsargatd).In an errone ous cognition like 'this is silver' (idatn rajatam), where nacre (su /f mother of pearl)is mistaken for silver, the objective content does not exactly corres pond to the external realities represented by silverness, silver and their relation; and the lack of correspond ence in such cases is due to a wrong correlation of the phases of visayavisayibhava, the a< junctness (prakd ratd) of the real silverness \vhich belongs to the real silver existing elsewhere being erroneously correlated with the substantiveness (visesyat a) which belongs to the nacre presented as idam (this). Thus, a careful analysis of the Nyaya definition of pramd nnd bhramawould make it clear that the Naiyfuikas are prepared to regard truth and error us rmixi.MJng in correspond ence and lack of correspondence with objective reality. 
The Nyaya theory of bhrama is known as anya th&khydtiv&da or the theory which explains erroneous cognition as misapprehension of one thing as another thing. In the phrase anyathakhyati, the term khydti means 'cognition' and anyathd means 'otherwise than what it is'. When nacre is wrongly seen as silver, the erroneous cognition that arises takes the form 'this is silver' (idam rajatam). Here, 'this' stands for nacre
122 A PRIMER OF INDJAN LOGIC [PART m  
lying in front of the knower; and it is first seen as a white piece and not as nacre, the distinctive feature of nacre being missed cither through some defect in sight 
or in the particular situation in which the visual per ception arises. The visual perception of racre as 'this* (idam) arises in the ordinary way, through laukika scwnikarsa or through the normal sense-relation ofcontact between the sense and the object seen. Thereal silverness (rajatatva), which belongs to the real silver existing elsewhere, is presented in this visual perception as the attribute of nacre seen as 'id am9in a general form; neither the real rajata nor the real rajatatva could be said to be connected with the sense of sight through normal sense-relation (laukikasauni karsa) ; and without sannikarsa (sense-relation) being established between the sense-organ concerned and the object to be perctivcd, perception cannot arise. So, the Naiya>ikas hold that the real silver and silverness come to be connected with the sense of sight through anextra-normal t) pe of sense-relation (alaitkikasanni karsa) which is called jnanalaksanapratyasatti (sense relation represented by cognition). The details relating to the different kinds of extra-normal sense-relation causing extra-normal perception will be fully explained under section 30, infra. In the present instance oferroneous cognition, features like white colour andbrightness, wi.ich nacre possesses in common with silver, are noticed; they remind the knower of the real silver and silverness which he might have seen else where; and the recollection (smrti) of the real silver ness (rajatatva) constitutes the exta-normal relation
CH. i] PERCEPTION 12$  
represented by cognition f jiidnalaksanapratydsatti), which brings silverness within the scope of the visual sense seeing nacre as 'this1(tWaw?)in the ordinary way.Thus, according to the Naiyayika*, the visual mis apprehension of nacre as silver is an extra-normal variety of visual perception (alaukikacdksusa). It may he noted here that the proposition 'One thing is mistaken for another' (anyat anyat lid grhyate), whichbrings out the meaning of the technical phrase anyatha khydti, is interpreted in two ways in Nyaya literature. The earlier Naiyayikas like Vacaspatimisra would take this proposition to mean 'One realityis mistaken for another reality' (sadantaram sadantaratmand grhyate) ; while later Naiyayikas like Garuresopadhyaya wouldtake it to mean, 'A real object which does not have a certain attribute is mistaken in an extra-normal percep tion as having that attribute, which exists elsewhere' (tadubhCivavat vaslu [nival jndyatc). 
Students of Nyaya epi*>temology cannot adequate ly estimate the phil sophical value of the Nyaya theory of anyathdkhydti without comparing it to some extent with the theories of bhrama (khyativ&da) propounded by the other schools of Indian philosophy. There are five theories of bhrama; viz., the theory of self-appre hension (dtmakhydti), the theory of non-being's appre hension (asatkhydti),the theory of non-apprehension (akhydti), the theory of misapprehension (anyathd khydti), and the theory of indefinable^ apprehension (anirvacanlyakhydti). The Yogacara school of Bud dhism, otherwise known as the Vijfianavada school, explains erroneous cognition as consistingin (he 'self*
124 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
which is identical with consciousness, externalising itself in the form of objects like silver; all determinatecognitions of objects, according to the Yogacarasubjectivists, are erroneous; this theory otbhramaiscalled atmakhyativada (theory of self-apprehension). The nihilistic school of Buddhists, otherwise known as the Madhyamaka school, explains bhrania as consisting in the cognition of a non-being (asat) ;in the case of the erroneous cognition 'this is silver* which arises wherethere is no silver, the object of the cognitionis a non being (asat) ;on the strength of experience, even non being should be taken to admit of being cognized; this theory of bhrama is known as asatkhydtivada. TheP^abhakara school of Mimarhsakas explains all cases ofbtirama as cases of non-apprehension. They contend that, in the cognition of silver where only nacre is seen, two cognitions arise in fact, one cognition being the perception of nacre in a general way as this (idam) 
and not as ;; 
--: the distinctive feature of 
nacreness, and the other cognition being the recollection of silver previously cognized elsewhere. The recollec tion of silver in this case is not identified by the knoweras recollection, but is cognized by him merely as cogni tion, since the object of recollection viz., silver is thought of merely as stiver, stripped of its association with past time and the particular place where it wasseen. The Prabhakaras describe such recollection by the phrase frramustatattakasmarana or 'recollection of an object robbed of its thai-ness.9In certain other cases of bhrama like 'the conch is yellow' (pitahCH. i] PERCEPTION 125   
sankhah), the Prabhakara theorist explains that twoimperfect perceptions arise, one being the visual perception of a conch as such, its real colour being missed, and the other being the visual perception of the yellow colour of the bilious matter which causes jaundice (pittadravyapitima) ,the relation of the yellow colour to the bilious substance beingmissed. Thus in all cases of bhratna, two distinct cognitions either aperception and a recollection or two perceptions arise; their distinction is missed; and the difference betweenobjects comes to be missed for the time being; as a result of such non-discrimination, volitional decision (pravrtti or y&tna) leading to voluntary activity arises;, a voluntary activity with a view to seizing the object of bhrania, such as silver, folows; the knower in such cases,, acting on his knowledge, realises through his experience that his activity has become futile, as he finds only nacre on the particular spot and no silver at all; and ia those cases, in view of the fact that the volitional decision {pravrtti) of the knower concerned leads to a futile activity, the cognitive antecedent of such a futile pravrtti is technically called bhrama. It will be seen that, while the Prabhakaras are prepared to give a place to the term bhrama in their vocabulary, they maintain that all experiences are valid (anubhutih prama)andthat the so-called cases of bhrama are only undiscri minated jumbles of cognitions whose objects also happen to be undiscriminated for the time being (jnanayohvisayayosca vivekagrahat bhramah).In other words,according to the Prabhakaras, to experience is to experience validly and to err in experience is to expert*
126 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
<ence imperfectly, though validly, the imperfection con sisting merely in non-discrimination and not in misapprehension. The Nyaya theory of anyathdkhyatihas already been explained. The Bhattas, for all practical purposes, adopt the Nyaya theory of bhrama,with this difference that they describe a bhrama as viparitakhydti or contrary experience; that they do not account for bhrama through extra-normal sense-rela tion; and that the relation (saihsarya) between nacre and silverness (Yajaiatva) or 'fc/aMand rajatam' ('this' and 'silver'), in the case of the misapprehension of nacre as silver,is a non-being (asat). Among the Vedantins, those of the dualistic school (dvaitinaty) maintain what they call their own version of anyathd khyati and contend that, in cases of erroneous experi ence like suktirajatabhrama, the silver which is presented in bhrama is non-being out-and-out (atyantdsat) within the sphere of nacre, though it is real elsewhere; and the chief argument in support of this view is that the siiblaiing cognition (bddhaka pratlti), which arise* later takes the form "Therewas no silver at all here in the past; it is not here now;and it will never be here in the future" (natra rajatamdslt, asti, bhavisyati), and it totally denies the existence of silver. within the sphere of nacre in the past, the pre sent and the future. The Vedantins of the Visistadvaita school adopt the Prabhakara theory of akhyati with certain modifications and their version of akhydti is known as 'non-apprehension cum apprehension of reality9(akhyatisamvalita-satkhyati).Sri Ramanujaand his foJJovvers hold that the object of bhrama is
H. i] PERCEPTION 127   
always real and there is strictly speaking no invalid cognition at all. In the perception of nacre as silver, it is the silver which is included among the component parts of nacre that is seen. They assume that subs tances which are similar must have some component parts in common, that silver is made up of parts of nacre and parts of silver and is called silver because the constituent parts represented by silver predominate; that in the constitution of nacre, likewise, the pre domin; ting part is represented by nacre and there is a small portion of silver; and that this small portion of silver it is, that happens to be seen when nacre is seen as silver. Thus according to the school of Sri Rama nuja, a person who errs in cognition really blunders into a subtle truth which, under normal conditions, is mi.^sed or ignored. 
A critical student of Indian philosophy would find reason to be dissaf isfied with every one of these theories of bhiama. The non-existent or mm-! ring (ova/) is an absolute zero and cannot be perverted in any experience, though the Madhyamakas insist that we are helpless in the matter and have to nrogni/.c the possibility of asat being presented in experience on the strength of experienceitself. The Yogacara idealist endeavours to improve upon the nothin^istic explana tion of the Madhyamakas by saying that consciousness comprises its configuration (sdkdram vijfianam), and in its externalised form, it is presented in itself as its object. But one can easily see that this explanation in volves a number of inconsistencies. The Nyaya realist realizes that nothing but reality (sat) adimtsotbt'mg
128 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
presented in experience; he explains that error consists in i>inf->;iihlin^ one reality with another reality andcomplicates his theory hy trying to bring the absent reality within the range of the sense-or^an concerned through the extra-normal relation (a'aukikasannikarsa) represented by some form of cognition itself (jfiana laksanapratydsatti). The Bhatta realists, while adop ting the theory of onyathukhytiti, find it necessary to accommodate themselves to the asatkhyuti theory, in holding that the samsarga element in the apprehension of nacre as silver and in such other cases is a non-being (asat). The Prabhakara realist sees the danger of compromise with the asatkhyuti on the one side, and onthe other side, sees how the Nyaya theory that onereality is presented as another reality (sadantaramsadantardttnand grhyate) would inevitably reduceitself to a variety of asatkhydti for the obvious reason that one reality never exists (is asat) in the form of another reality. In order to avoid these difficulties the Prabhakara realist adoptsthe extreme theory of akhydti. Though this is the only theory which could be said to be perfectly consistent with realism, it is not adequate to account for the volitional decision (Pravrtti) and the further activity that follows a bhratna. As Vacaspatimisra points out in his Tdtparya tika and Bhawatl, (in the akhydiivdda) one could find as much justificationin non-identification (abhedd gr&ha), for the two cognitionsin cases of bhramaappearing as two cognitiveunits and consequently for the two objects in such cases appearing as different, as in non-discrimination (bheddgr&ha), for the two-
CH. i] PERCEPTION 129   
cognitions and their two objectsin such cases appearingas one and the same; and as a result, if there should be volitional decision in the direction of activity on the latter ground, there should be volitional decision in the opposite direction of abstention on the former groundand the knovver should hang between pravrlti andnivrtti. These difficulties, the Advaitins endeavour to meet by propounding the theory of anirvacanlyaTehydti and explaining bhrama as experienceof a relatively real object, which is neither absolute being (sat), norabsolute non-being (asat), nor both. According to the Advaitins, when nacre is seen as silver, for instance, what happens is this: over the real substratum (adhisthana) represented by a nacre, or more correctly, nacre-delimited spirit (suktyavacchiiinacoitanya) the beginningless positive mist of nescience (anudibhava riipajnarla) happens to be thrown; when the sense of sight comes into relation with nacre in a general way,the mist is partly dispelled by the cognitive modification of antahkorana which takes the form 'this' (idamd karavrtti) ; the mist of nescience, however, continues to veil the nacreness of what is seen as this (idam) and, reinforced by the prepossessions of the knower'smind and by the similarity between the object seen as 'this' and silver, undergoes transformation, with the result that silver comes into being also with the cogni tion of silver, which is but a cognitive modification of nescience (suktyavacchinnacaitanyadhisthitavidya raja tarapena rajatakuravrttirupena ca parinamate); silver which thus conies into being has relative reality ; it is said to be anirvacaniya in the sense that it does not 9
130 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
admit of being definitely described as sat (being), or asat (non-being) or both; and it is also said to be prdtibhdsika in the sense that it is coterminous with its presentation in cognition.It will thus be seen that the Advaitin's theory of bhrama regards it as a cognitive complex consisting of two cognitive factors, one of them being a vrtti of antahkarana and the other being a vrtti of avidyd. According to this theory, the object of a bhrama is real in a relative sense and comes into being along with the bhrama and lasts as long as the bhrama lasts; and there is no need for accommodationto asatkhyati or for any complication in the form of extra-normal (alaiikika)sense-relation. That the Advaitins have no particular animus against the advocates of anyathdkhydtivdda is evident from the way in which they are readily willingto accept the explanation of anyathdkhydti in the case of what is known as sopddhikabhrama, where the object of bhramahappens to be within the normal scope of the sense organ, as, for instance in the erroneous perception of a crystal (sphatika)as red-coloured when a japd (Chinarose) is seen to be in its vicinity. Such students ofIndian philosophy as are capable of critically reviewingthe five 'theories' of bhrama (khyativdda) set forth here would not find it difficult to conceive of an appro priate graph by means of which the epistemological inter-relation of these theories may be exhibited andcomprehended. If one could imagine that epistemo logical thought starts with asatkhydti as centre and, in its endeavour to escape from it, swings forcibly betweenthe two diametrical termini of anyathdkhydti and
OH. i] PERCEPTION 131   
akhyati, it would not be difficult to imagine that such thought inevitably describes a comprehensive epistemo logicai circle in the form of anirvacanlya'khyati, whicheasily accommodates itself to akhydti in respect of the non-discrimination of the two vrttis constituting abhrawa and to anyathdkhycLti by complete surrender in the case of sopddhikabhrama. 
It would be quite appropriate to consider here the Nya\a view regarding the way in which the validity and invalidity of a cognition, or truth and error, orprdmdnya and aprdmdnya have to be accounted for andascertained. The Naiyayikashold that validity andinvalidity of cognitions are made out through extrinsic considerations and are brought about by extrinsic circumstances. In other words, according to the Naiyayikas, validity and invalidity cannot be said to be intrinsically made out (svalograkya)or intrinsically brought about (svatojanya). Intrinsicality (svatastva) in respect of the knowledge of reality consists in reality being made out by every means by which the cognition having it is ascertained but not ascertained to be invalid. This definition of svatogrdhyatva is expressed thus in the technical language of Nyaya : "(rdmdnyasyajfiaptau svatastvam 'a !.iprl ii,;.'!ry.l ;r'i!t j7'ayCi: a/;iTJ*:a grahakasamagrigrdhyatvam." Whenever a person knows that he cognizes and does not know for the moment that he errs, he also knows that he validly cognizes: this is the contention of the advocates ofsvatograhyatva or the theory that validity is intrinsically made out. THUS, if a person could become aware ofthe existence of a cognition in him in a hundred
132 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART UI   
without becoming aware that that cognition is erroneous and in any one of those cases he becomes aware of the cognition only without becoming aware of its validity, the definition of svcttograhyatva would not hold goodand the view that validity is made out extrinsically (paratggrahya)has inevitably to be accepted. TheNaiyayikas explain their position thus in regard to this question. A determinate cognition like "this is silver" (idam rajatam) is called vyavasaya and it is presented first in the anuvyavasdya (after-cognition or conscious 
ness of a cognition) which takes a form like this "I cognize this silver" (idam rajatam janami), and in this anuvyavasaya, the validity of the cognition referred to 
is not presented.If such anuvyavasaya were to in variably take cognizance of the validity of such vyava saya, it would not be possible to account for the doubt which an inexperienced person feels regarding the vali dity of such vyavasaya. So, in such cases, the validity of the vyavasaya "this is silver" should be ascertained through the practical result to which it leads.- If the voluntary decision and activity following such vyava saya should turn out to be fruitful and if the knowershould actually find himself in a position to get the silver which he wanted, such vyavasaya (cognition)is recog nized to be valid. The process of inference through which one's mind may pass in such cases is usually put in this form: "This cognition is valid, because it leads to a fruitful effort; any cognition that leads to a fruit ful effort is valid, as another valid cognition already realized to be such in experience, (idam jndnamprama', saphalapravrttijanakatvat; yadyat saphala-
CH. i] PERCEPTION 133   
pravrttijanakam tat jnanam prama; yathti praman taram). It should be borne in mind, in this connection, that causing fruitful effort is, according to Nyaya the ground of inferring validity, while validity itself con sists in the cognition in question cognizing a thingas possessing an attribute which it really has. In that the Naiyayikas make the ascertainment of the truth of acognition 'dependent upon its agreement with its expec ted workings or, in other words, with the consequenceswhich are expected to arise from it in the experience ofthe active subject, their view would appear to be closely similar to that of the modern pragmatist. However,they do not lose sight of the fact that pragmatism is only a method of ascertaining truth, that this methoditself presupposes truth whose nature has to be explain ed independently of agreement with practical workingsand that, if the truth presupposed by the pragmaticargument were itself to be ascertained pragmatically, through inference, the fault of regressus ad infinitum would inevitably follow. Having due regard to such difficulties, the KTaiyayikas define truth as consisting in correspondence with reality and thus combine their pragmatic theory with a theory which has much in common with what is known as the correspondence notion of truth in western philosophical literature. TheNyaya definition of validity (pramatva) makes it clear that truth consists in correspondence with reality. TheNayiyayikas also point out that, only in cases where acognition leads to effort in practical experience or it happens to be pravaftaka, it becomes necessary to ascertain the validity of such cognition in order to
134 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
ensure unfaltering effort (niskampapravrtti) ; and that, on the first occasion of halting effort (sakampapra vrtti), it is not necessary that the cognition leading to such effort should have been definitely made out to be valid and it would do if such cognition should not havebeen definitely ascertained to be invalid. It can be easily seen from this that there is no room for any fear of anavastha (endless regression) or atmdsraya (self dependence) in the pragmatic method of inferring truth as employed by the Naiyayikas.In respect ofthe question how validity and invalidity are brought about, the Nyaya theory is that they are brought about by certain extrinsic circumstances which, for the sake of convenience, are called gunas (good features) anddosas (defects) ;in other words the Nyaya theorists maintain paratastva (extrinsicalit)>)in respect of the utpatti (production)of validity and invalidity of a cognition as well as in respect of their jnapti (know ledge). For instance the validity of a perception is secured by the good feature (guna) consistingin the adequacy of the contact between the sense-organ con cerned and its object; and its invalidity is the result of defects such as distance and some disease affecting the 
sense-organ. 
It would be interestingto contrast the ITyaya theory of truth and error with the epistemological theories put forward by other schools of Indian philo sophy about truth and error. The Sarhkhyas maintain that both validity and invalidity are intrinsically madeout in the sense that it is by virtue of the reflection or proximity of the same cit (self-luminious conscious-CH. i] PERCEPTION 135   
ness), that the existence of a cognitive vftti and its validity or invalidity are illuminated. PrSbhakaras make no difference between vyavasdya and anuvyava saya and maintain that,in every cognition,the knower, the known object, and knowledge itself, along with its validity, are presented. They advocate the theory of intrinsicality (svatastvapaksa),in so far as validity (pramdtva) is concerned; and there is no question of error (apramatva)in their theory, since they maintain that all experiences are valid (anubhutih pramd). TheBhattas contend that co-nil ion is to be inferred through its effect, called jndtatdor prakatya, whichconsists in what some of them describe as a temporaryluminosity (prakdsa) arisingin known objectsandi referred to in propositionslike 'this is known' (ayamfndtah) ;and that in such inference the cognition whichhas caused fndtatd, and its validity are presented. Thevalidity which is thus intrinsically made out may bestultified by a subsequent sublating cognition ; and thus, in the Bhatta theory, invalidity (apramdtva)is extrin sically made out. The Bhattas are, therefore, to betaken to advocate svatastva in the case of validity andparatastva in the case of invalidity. Murarimisra, whodoes not go the whole hog either as a Prabhakara or as a Bhatta, but who is undoubtedly a A amamsaka, recog nizes, like a Naiyayika, that a cognition (vyavasaya) is cognized by its after-cognition (anuvyavasaia) ,but maintains, unlike a Naiyayika,that the validity ofvyavasaya is also presented in the same anuvyavasdya.It will thus be seen that Murarimisra is an advocate of the theory of the intrinsicality of validity (pram&-
136 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
tvam svato grhyate). The Bauddhas, on the other hand, hold that all determinate knowledge (savikal- $aka) fin so far as one is conscious of it, is erroneous (aprama) and its apramdtva is intrinsically made out; 
while, through inference, the validity (pramatva) of indeterminate cognition (nirvikalpaka}is extrinsically made out. The Buddhists thus advocate the theory of extrinsicality (paratastvapaksa)in regard to validity 
and intrinsicality (svatastvapaksa)in regard to invali dity. According to the Advaitins, the validity of a cognition is intrinsically made out in the sense that the witnessing inner spirit (saksicaitatoya), which illumi nates the valid cognitive vrtti, also illuminates its vali dity (prawatva); and the invalidity (apramdlva)of a cognitive vrtti is inferred extrinsically, through the resultant effort becoming futile. In order to evaluate adequately the different theories of pramatva andapramatva set forth here, it is necessary to note that the Naiyayikas would answer in the affirmative, the question 'Is error possible in realism?1 and wouldexplain the possibility of error by showing how a real substantive (visesya) and a real attribute (prakdra) may be erroneously correlated when they are presented in cognition and thus save realism itself from being ruined by conceding the possibility of error. ThePrabhakara realists think that any concession of the possibility of error (bhrama) would spell the ruin of realism and insist that all experiences are valid (anubhfltih pramd) and that the so-called bhramasinvolve an element of non-discrimination (aviveka). The Bhafta realists adopt the anyathdkhyati of Nyaya
CH.I] PERCEPTION 137   
with suitable modifications ; and in order to preserve realism effectively, they would make the knowledge of cognition (jndna) dependent upon the knownness
(jndtatd) of the object (jneya) and thus provide an effective counterblast to idealism which seeks to mergeall jneya in jndna. The Buddhist idealist rules out truth and considers all determinate knowledge (savikal paka) erroneous. The advocates of the theory of intrinsicality of validity (pramdnyasvatastvavddinah'), more especially the Bhattas and the Advaitins, wouldgenerally emphasise the ideas that, in a valid cognition, the object is not stultified by a subsequent sublating cognition and is not merely re-exhibited through a reminiscent impression, the former of these two fea tures being stressed in particular; and this way of looking at pramdtva would be quitein accord with the view that aprawiatva is made out extrinsically andpramatva intrinsically.It may also be noted, with advantage, that, in the Nyaya theory, anuvyavasaya(the subject-centred after-cognition)is regarded as self-luminous (svaprakasa) in the sense that it reve; Is itself along with the vyavasdya (the object-centred cognition in which the knower and knowledge are not presented) ; and that, in this respect, the Nyaya realist seeks to combine in a way his objectivism with anaspect of subjectivistic thought which is not incom patible with his realism. In this kind of compromise,a danger is lurking, as students of Advaita may easily see, and this danger consists in the manner in whichthe Nyaya view lends itself to ^anuvyavasaya being treated as a fragmentary appearance of the absolute
138 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
reality represented by the absolute, self-luminous consciousness called cit. 
An intelligent attempt to review syntheticallyall the theories of bhrama known to Indian philosophy will bring to light the fact that, in some manner or other, a negative element is involved in every one of the five khyativadas (theories explaining the nature of bhrama). In the asatkhyati doctrine, the' negative element is obvious; and in dtmakhydti doctrine, it is obvious in so far as objective externalityis concerned. In the anyathakhyati view, the negative element is to be found in the samsarya part or in the idea that onereality is presented as another reality which it is not or that a real substantive is presented as having a real attribute which it has not; and in the akhydti doctrine, one can easily detect the negative element in the idea of non-discrimination (aviveka). The anirvacaniyakhyatidoctrine appears on the surface to eschew the negative element from the conception of bhiama; but, in fact, the negative element is replaced by relativity whichimplies a negative element and transfers the negative element from the side of object to the side of definite predications (nirvacana) with reference to the object. A careful investigation of the Advaitin's anirvacamya khyati, as compared with the other theories of bhrama^would lead to the mystery of error being unravelled through the disentanglement of negativity, which is the inner core of bhrama. But this would not amount to all the theories of bhrama being reduced to the level ofasatkhy&ti; for, it should be remembered that negativ ity is only the other side of relativity and an aspect of
CH. i] PERCEPTION 139  
reality. If one might be permitted here to indulge for a while in epigrammatising, one might well saythat yes (sat) and no (asat) are the fulcra of all epistemologyas they are of all metaphysics ; that yes and no are but phases of the same reality; that all appearancesare the offspring of a cross between yes arid no\ that it will be evident through the gemination of yes and no, that yes is no and no is yes; and 'that error (bkrama)is the antechamber of truth (pramd). 
In subsections (f) and (g) of section 28 of the text, valid experience (pramd) and its instrument are each divided into four kinds. The term pramdna is used in this section in the sense of the efficient special cause or instrument (karana) of valid experience. Theword pramdna is sometimes used in the sense of valid experience (pramd), as for instance in the proposition 'idam rajatam iti jfidnani pramd' (thisis siver this is valid experience). /In the word pramdna, the suffix ana denotes an instrument in the former case; and in the latter case, it denotes bhava (the meaning of the root itself). The Indian materialists, called Carvakas,recognize only one pramdna, viz., perception: the Bauddhas and the Vaisesikas recognize two pramdnas*viz., perception and inference; the Samkhyas recognize three, viz., perception, inference and verbal testimony; the Naiyayikas recognize four, viz., perception, inference, assimilation and verbal testimony; the Prabhakaras recognize five, viz., the above four pra mdnas and presumptive testimony (arthdpatti) ; the Bhattas and Advaitins recognize these five pramdnasand non-cognition (anupalabdhi)as the sixth pram&na;
140 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART n  
and the Pauranikas recognise these six pramdnas and, in addition, recognize necessary inclusion (sambhava)and traditional hearsay (aitihya)as the seventh andthe eight prawi&na. The leading exponents of Indian philosophy are unanimous in discardingthe last two, sambhava and aitihyajfthe reason is obvious; the former which enables one, for instance, to be sure of fifty when hundred are guaranteed is nothing morethan a plain case of immediate inference; and the latter, which consists in traditional hearsay like 'a spirit dwells in this banyan tree* (ihavate yaksastisthati),is no 'pramdna at all until it is verified, and when verified, it comes under verbal testimony. The argumentsadvanced by Carvakas to reject even anumana and the grounds on which the Vaisesikas and Bauddhas wouldbring upamana (comparison or assimilation) and sabda(verbal testimony) under inference will be considered under appropriate heads in chapters II, III and IV, in/ra. The Naiyayikas would bring presumptive testi mony (arthapat ti} under anumdna (inference), and in some cases, under sabda (verbal testimony). A refer ence to pages 44 to 47 supra would show how the TTaiyayikas and Prabhakaras discard anupalabdhi(non-cognition) as a distinct pramdna and how the former reduce it to the level of a necessary acessory to pratyaksa, in perceiving non-existence (abhava). Fromchapter III it will be seen that the PTyaya view of upamana is different in several respects from the MImamsaka's view of that pramdna. 
It would be useful to consider here how the chief champions of arthdpatti, the Bhattas and Prabhakaras,
CH. i] PERCEPTION 141   
maintain that it is a distinct pramdna and should not be brought under anumdna or sabda and on what groundsthe Naiyayikas refuse to recognize it as a distinct prdmana. According to the Bhattas, a knowledge of some fact which is unaccountable otherwise than bypresumptively granting another fact is the instrumentin the case of arthdpatti and the knowledge presump tively arrived at of the explanatory fact is the resultant cognition (upapdd^ajndnam karanam, upapadakajfidnamphalam). For instance, Devadatta is alive and not present in his house; this fact has to be accounted for (upafddya), and cannot be accounted for otherwise than by presumptively granting that he must be present in some place outside his housd[bahissadbhdvakalfa<namvind nopapadyate). In the Bhatta view, the etymologyof the word arthdpatti should be explained in two waysaccording as the word is taken in thesenseof thejnstru mental cognition- (karanibhutajndna) or resultant QOgftitiQrTl^halibhutajndna).In the former caey HuT~~woFd is to be explained as denoting the knowledge of the fact which has to be accountedfor and is otherwise unaccountable the knowledgethrough which the needed explanatory fact is presump tively arrived at (arthasya upapddakasya kalpandyasydh anyathdnupapannasya upapddyasya pratitehsd). In the latter case, the word denotes the presumptive knowledge of the required explanatory circumstance (arthasya upapddakasya kalpand). The Bhattas define arthdpatti to be a pramdna which consists in such aconflict between two valid cognitions, of which onetakes a general form and the other takes a specific form
142 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
of a conflicting character, as necessarily leads to the presumptive knowledge of a fact which removes the conflict. One of the stock examples given by themmay be set forth thus: It is known for certain that Caitra is alive; he must be present in someparticular place; he is not present in his house; so, he is presumably present elsewhere. ThatCaitra is alive and present in some particular place is an established fact which is presented in the valid cognition taking a general form (sadhdrana pramdna). That he is not present in his house is also an established fact which is presented in the valid cognition taking a specific form (asddhdranapramdna).The conflict between these two pramdnas is not of the nature of the irreconcilable conflict which one notices between two contradictories; but it is of the nature ofthe conflict between a general affirmation and specific exclusion or between a general rule and an exception (sdmdnya and visesa). The Naiyayikas contend that, in such cases, there is no real conflict at all since both the general affirmation and the specific exclusion may be true. The Bhattas point out in reply that conflict neednot always be thoroughgoing as in the case of two con tradictories, and that partial conflict is quite conceiv able. In instances like the one cited above, there is real conflict, though of a partial nature and there is a stage in the process of thought, at which the validity of the general affirmation is about to be completely imperilled. Caitra is alive and must be present somewhere ; he is not present in his house; between this stage in thought and the final stage of presuming Caitra's presence out-
CH. i] PERCEPTION 143   
side his house, the truth of the pre-establishedfact ofhis being alive stands imperilled; thus, just at this intervening stage, there is the possibility of the know ledge that Caitra is alive being falsified; and the knower's conviction that this knowledge is true induces him to presume that Caitra is present outside his houseand to prevent the possibility of falsification frombecoming actualised. The Bhattas maintain in this manner that arthdpatti, as an instrument of valid cog nition, is represented by a kind of conflict between a sddhdranapramdna and asddhdranapramdna (a valid cognition in the form of a general affirmation and a valid cognition in the form of a specific denial orexclusion), and that the resultant prama arising froma consciousness of such a conflict is a presumptive type of knowledge. If the essential element in arthdpatti is that a certain fact like Caitra's being alive and n0t being present in his house is unaccountable withoutpresuming another fact like Caitra's being outside his house, could not arthdpatti be reduced to inference based on negative concomitance (vyatirekyanumaaa) ? This is what the IsTaiyayikas ask. To get over this difficulty and to prevent arthdpatti being reduced to anumarta, the Prabhakaras urge that, in the exampleabove referred to, it is not the possible falsification ofthe knowledge of Caitra being alive that constitutes the pramdna called arthdpatti ; but it is the doubt regardingCaitra being alive (fivanasamsaya), which arises fromthe conflict indicated above, that serves as the means ofthe resultant cognition which consists in the presump tive knowledge of Caitra being outside his house
144 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART IB   
(bahissattvakalpana). While the strong point in the Prabhakara view of arthapatti is that by treating doubt as the means of presumption, the pramana in question is redeemed from the grip of anumana, the weak spot in that view is that it exalts doubt to the rank of a pramana', but the Prabhakaras, who hold that all experience is valid, wr ould be quite willing to take this criticism as a compliment. The Bhattas meet the difficulty raised by the Naiyayikas, by pointing out that the fundamental element in the mental process involved 
in arthapatti is presumption through negative concomi tance (vyatirekavydpti)while the fundamental element in the mental process called anumdna is subsumptionunder positive concomitance (anvayavyapti) ; and that presumptive knowledge is cognition of a distinct t>pe belonging more to the side of imagination than to inference belonging more to the sphere of hypothesis than to the sphere of inferentially established thesis, and it is articulated through propositions like 'I pre sume* and not through propositions like 'I infer*. TheBhattas do not approve of the way in which the Prabhakaras have exalted doubt in this connection to the rank of a pramana. It is also pointed out by the Bhattas that there are certain cases of presumptive knowledge which do not admit of being reduced to inference. For instance, Devadatta is known to be present in the third house from mine ; it is presumedthat he is not presentin any other house \ this presump tive knowledge refuses to be reduced to inference; it would not be a sound argument to say that any place other than the third house from mine is not a placeCH.I] PERCEPTION 145   
Devadatta is, on tha ground that such a place happensto be different from the third5 house from mine and onthe analogy of the second house from mine; for with equal force it might be argued that any place other than the three houses which have come within the scope of my observation is the place where Devadatta is pre sent, on the ground that such a placeis different fromthe two houses adjacent to the third house in which heis present and on the analogy of that third house. TheNaiyayikas would, however, explain their attitude in the matter by pointing out that, where one has to rely exclusively on negative concomitance (vyattrekavyapii) one's mind has to pass inevitably through a stage olpositive concomitance (anvayavyapti) before it arrives at the resultant cognition; that presumptive knowledge(kalpatoa) is really the anticipatory forestalling by the imaginative side of one's mind of what its somewhatslower ratiocinative side arrives at through inference; and that such foreshadowings through negative con comitance (vyaiirekavyapti) may well be broughtunder anumana as a distinct variety of it and need not be exalted to the rank of a distinct pram&na. It should be remembered in this connection that the Bhattas* maintain that what the Naiyayikas would treat as in ference based exclusively on negative examples andnegative concomitance {kevalavyatirekyanum&na) is. realty no inference at all and demands a distinct place as pramana, since it lacks the essential feature ofinference vie., direct subsumption to positive con.. comitance. The Bhattas realize the danger that this 10
146 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
way of merging vyatirekin in artttdpatti may lead to the entire province of anumana being swallowed up by the latter; and this fear they remove, by drawing attention to the fact that the inference of fire in a mountain from
Smoke, for instance, through the concomitance of fire and smoke in all observed cases, may be reduced to arthapatti, and that the universal concomitance of all smokes and all fires, including the few observed and*nany unobserved cases, is a clear case of inference -which cannot be accounted for by any pramana other 4han anumana. The Bhattas speak of two kinds of vrthdpatti, srut&rth&palti and drstarth&patti, according as the upapadya (the fact requiring explanation) is made out through perception or through verbal testimony. 
In section 28 of the text, four kinds of pramanasare referred toby Annambhatta. A pratnanais a karanaof a valid cognition (prama). The concept of karanahas to be elucidated. The author proceeds to define 
karana in section 29 (a) and this leads on to a detailed Consideration of the Nyaya view of causation. 29 
T (a) Karana (efficient 
or instrumental cause) is a
special cause. 
(b) The invariable antece 
dent of an effect is its cause. 
(c) -An effect is the coun 
ter-correlative of its antecedent 
non-existence.
CH. i] PERCEPTION 147   
(</) Cause is of three 
kinds, the three varieties being 
inherent cause, non-inherent 
cause, and occasioning cause. 
(e) That is called inherent 
cause, in which the effect inheres 
when it is produced. For in 
stance, threads are the inherent 
cause of a cloth, and a cloth 
of its colour and such other 
qualities. 
(/)_That is called non 
inherent cause, which serves 
as a cause, while co-inhering 
with its effect, or with the 
inherent cause of its effect. For
instance, contact between
threads is the non-inherent 
cause of cloth; and the colour 
of the threads is the non-inher 
ent cause of the colour of the 
cloth. 
(9) Occasioning cause is 
a cause not coining under either 
of the above-mentioned kinds. 
For instance, the shuttle, the 
loom and such other things are
the occasioning causes of cloth. 
(h) Of these three varie 
ties of causes, only that is called
148 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PAfcTiti   
an efficient or instrumental cause 
(karana), which operates as
special cause. 
Annambhatta's definition of karana uses the phrase asftdharanakGrana. The terms sadharawa(general) and asQdharana (special) are vague andhave to be interpretedin relation to the context in which they are used. In the present context, sadharana karana should be understood as a cause which is believed to be the common cause of all the conceivable effects in the world; and in this sense, according to the Nyayatheorists, God, time, space and such other things are general or common causes. Asddharanakarana should be understood as a cause which is not common to all the effects but is the special cause of particular effects or classes of effects; and in this sense, the componentparts of a pot called kapala (potsherd),the potter's stick and such other antecedents of a pot are its special causes. The Naiyayikas of the older school would
define a karana as a special and mediate cause (asadha ranakarana), its mediacy consistingin its causal opera tion depending upon the co-operation of its intermedi ate effect in producing its final result. The intermediate 
factor which a karana causes and which, in its turn, co-operates with the karana in producing the final result is technically called vyapara. The term vyapara, in this restricted sense, should not be confounded with 
the same term used in the generalsense of activity. In the restricted sense of the intermediate accessory of a karana, a vyapara is defined in Sanskrit in this way tajjanyah tajf&nyajanakasca vyaparah*
CH, i] PERCEPTION J49   
(A vydfdra is caused by a karqnp, and in associa tion with it, causes its fin^l effect). The full defini tion of a karana, according to the older Naiyayi kas, is this: vyapdravat asddhdranakdranam karanam.Annambhatta considers it expedient to adopt this defi 
nition. A potter's stick (danda) is karana in the sense that he uses it in revolving his wheel and it causes the pot through the rotation of the wheel (cakrabhramana).A sense-organ is pramdJiarana in the sense that in asso ciation with its intermediate vydpdra, which consists in its relation with the object (sannikarsa),it produces a valid perception (pratyaksaprama). The Navyanaiya yikas are not in favour of this definition of karana. They would define it as a cause which is felt to be mostnecessary for having the effect, or for want of whichit is believed that the effect is not produced though all the other causes are duly .present (phaldyoga vyavacchinnaW kdranam karanaw). Understood in this way, a potter's stick may be looked upon as karana;and likewise the rotation of the potter's wheel or eventhe contact between the component parts of a pot; in other words, according as the view-point varies, onemay refer to an instrument or to its intermediate func tion or even to asamav&yikdrana as karana. The viewof the later Naiyayikas thus agrees with that of the Vaiydkaranas in respect of 'fyaranatva, the Paninlyanconception of a karana being that it is most efficient ofall the causes (sddhakatamam karanam). 
The Nyaya theorists define a cause (karana)as aninvariable, immediate and indispensable antecedent ofan effect. In Sanskrit, the full definition of a karana
150 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
is set forth thus: MryaniyatGvyavahitapftrvavrtrtananyathasiddham ca karanam. This definition insists upon three conditions being satisfied before an antece dent and a consequent could be connected as cause andeffect. The antecedent should immediately precede the consequent; the two should be invariablyco-existent with each other; and the antecedent in questionshould not be made out to be otherwise than indispensable. Mere co-existence or even invariable co-existence, as in the case of a pot and threads which may be found in the same place, or of earthness (prthivitva) and smell, is not causality. Immediate sequenceis one of the essential elements in causality. The adjunct ananyaiha sfddha, introduced in the definition of a cause, literally means 'not made out to be otherwise t^an indispen sable*. Anyatha means otherwise] siddha meansmade out; otherwise, in the context of causation, means other-wise than indispensable; ananyathasiddhar as an adjunct to an antecedent factor, thus means 'not made out to be otherwise than indispensable* or 'not made out to be such as one can do without*. This use of the word anyathasiddha should not be confoundedwith its use as an adjunct with reference to the result kept in view (prayojana).In phrases like ananyatha siddham prayojanatn, the result kept in view is described as something which cannot be accomplished otherwise than by particular means. With reference to a cause, ananyathfisiddha means, as already explained, an antecedent which is not made out to be otherwise than indispensable. A may be seen to be an invariable antecedent of B; still, one may be justified in thinking-
CH.I] PERCEPTION 151that it is not indispensable ;in that case, A should not be regarded as cause of B. The Naiyayikas have madean attempt to classifyall the conceivable varieties ofdispensable antecedents (anyathasiddha) and usually recognize five classes of dispensable antecedents. Athing is made out to be invariable antecedent, only a&determined by a delimiting adjunct; for instance^ thread (tantu) is an invariable antecedent of cloth, under the aspect of threadness (tantutva) ;this delimit ing adjunct, though it finds a placein a definite concep tion of the causality referred to, does not participate in the creative process involved in such causality and is therefore felt to be dispensable in the sense that the causal process does not depend upon it; all such de limiting adjuncts of causeness (karanatavacchedaka) form the first class of anyathasiddha. Invariable sequence between an antecedent and a consequentis generally made out through a knowledge of invariable concomitance between these two factors and betweentheir negations in other words, through a knowledgeof anvaya and vtfatireka; the colour of thread may be made out to be an invariable antecedent of cloth;but in this case, the anvaya and vyatireka, with reference to the colour of thread and cloth, cannot be made out independently of the invariable concomitance between thread and cloth on the positive and negative sides; the colour of thread is therefore anyathasiddha withreference to cloth and is typical of the second class of dispensable antecedents. The third class of dispensable antecedents is represented by ether (dkdsa)in relation to a cloth; in this case, ether being eternal,,it max be:  
152 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC   
easily shown to precede every effect ; but it has to be conceived of as cause through the delimiting Adjunct ctherness (akafatva), which involves causal relation with sound; a thing which cannot be specifically thought of except as the cause of a certain effect may well 
be imagined to be a tiling whose causal efficacyis com pletely pre-occupied in the direction of that effect and is 410 longer available in any other direction; and the feeling, therefore, in the case of akasa, is that it maysnay be dispensed with in producing a cloth. Thefourth variety of anyathdsiddha is represented byinstances like the weaver's father with reference to a cloth woven by his son ; only as the weaver's father, he is made out to be the invariable antecedent of the cloth, and not in his own right; and the feelingin that case is that one can do without the weaver's father in ac counting for the production of a cloth. The fifth variety is represented by instances like an ass; it mayso happen that in the case of an individual cloth, a certain ass precedes it; the particular ass necessarily turns out to be the invariable antecedent of the parti cular cloth; but it is felt that certain antecedents, other than the ass, which are known to be quite adequate to account for the production of similar cloths, must be 
adequate in the case also of the particular cloth underreference; and so, the ass, in that case, is anyathasiddha. Annambhatfca, following Gangesopadhyaya, wouldcombine the first two varieties into one, and likewise the third and fourth varieties, and would thus recognise only three classes of dispensable antecedents. In fact, later Naiy^yikaa show that all these five varieties inay

(sarlra) or thought (upasthiti) or relation (samban dha) as the case may be, should be eliminated as a* dispensable antecedent (anyathasiddha) ; this principle holds good in all the five varieties of anyathasiddha. Thus all the five varieties may be brought under the comprehensive formula that invariable antecedents of a simpler type being quite adequate to account for the effect under reference, another antecedent, though in variable, has to be discarded as a dispensable antecedent (anyathasiddha) . This formula is expressed in thi$ way in Nyaya literature"laghuniyatapurvavartinaiva karyasqmbhave tadbhinnam anyathasiddham,"Theadjunct anatiyathdsiddhain the definition of a cause is intended to eliminate all such antecedents as one can reasonably feel one may well do without. After introducing the qualification'not made out to be otherwise than indispensable* (anayathasiddha),it has to be considered whether the adjunct 'invariable' (niyata) is accessary. It would appear that most of
154 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
the antecedents which are not invariably concomitantwith the consequents in question can easily be eliminated as dispensable antecedents; for instance, an ass is neither an invariable nor an indispensable antecedent ofa certain cloth. However, when the whole species of effects represented by cloth is sought to be connected as effect with some species as cause, the general formula of anyathdsiddha does not hold good ; for, one can never say that the antecedents recognized as causing another species of effects,like a jar, would be adequate to produce the species under reference, viz., cloth; andin such cases, the only way in which accidental antece dents like an ass can be eliminated would be through the adjunct 'invariable' (niyata). 
The conception of a karya or an effect involves, according to the Nyaya theory of causation, the idea that the effect is invariably preceded by its antecedent non-existence. To say that a jar is produced meansr in the Nya>a theory, that it is created for the first time and that it never existed before. Consistently with the creationistic view of causation (arambhavada\ Annam bhatta defines an effect as the counter-correlative of antecedent non-existence. In this connection students are advised to consider again the remarks about pragabh&vain pages 37 to 40, part III, supra. Positive product (bhavakarya) has three kinds of causes; the first being of the nature of component parts or of the nature of the substratum in which the effectuated quality or activity inheres and called 'inherent cause' (samav&yikarana) ; 
the second being of the nature of the Conjunction of parts producing the whole or of the nature of theCH. i] PERCEPTION 155-   
quality or activity inhering in the component parts or a substratum and producing a corresponding quality in the whole or disjunction in the same substratum, andcalled non-inherent cause (asamav&yikdrana) ;and the third being of the nature of agent and such other causes, not falling under either of the first two heads, and being called occasioning cause (toinrittaltararia).It would be a mistake to suppose that all the nimittas are less important than the other two varieties. For, karla or the intelligent agent, in whose absence the other causes become ineffectual, is technically a nimitta, but is, in a sense, the most important of all the varieties of causes. 
That is a samavayikarano, in which the effect inheres as it comes into being. The component parts (avayavah), like threads, thus form the inherent cause of a composite substance (avayavin}, like a cloth; andlikewise a substance, of the quality or activity which is produced in it. To secure precision and avoid confu sion, the delimiting adjuncts of effectness (kdryatd) and causeness (karanata') karyaiavacchedakadharmaand kfiranatavacchedakadharma should be specified in defining the relation of cause and effect in every case, as also the relations which determine the co-existence of the antecedent and the consequent in question kdryatuvacchedakasambandha and karanatavacchedaka sambandha. Causality involves invariable co-existence between an antecedent and a consequent; their co-existence (sam&nddhikaranya) is their presence in the same place; when they are present in the same place they should each be connected with the common sub-
156 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
stratum through a relation ; the relation which connects the antecedent with the common substratum (samdna dhikarana) is known as the determinating relation ofcauseness (karanatavacchedakasambyndha); and the relation which connects the consequent with the samesubstratum is called the determining relation of effect ness (karyatavacchedattasambandha). The exponentsof the Nyaya-Vaisesika doctrine of causation contendthat, by a careful observation of the invariable con comitance between an antecedent and a consequent, as determined by particular delimiting adjuncts and rela tions, as also of the invariable concomitance betweenthe negations of such antecedent and consequent of anvayasahacdra and vyatireTtasahacdrathe, causal re lation in every case can be accurately defined so as to obviate every conceivable hitch. In the case of a samavayikurana, like threads in relation to a cloth (tant avaJi patasya), the simplest and the most accurate way in which the causal relation may be defined is this: 'the causeness delimited by thrcadness and by the rela tion of identity (tantulvdvacchinnd tadqtmyasam bandhdvacchinnd ca kdranata) is correlated to the cffcchu'ss delimited by clothness and by the relation of inherence (patatvavacchinnasaniavayasQinbandhavac chinnakaryatanirupita). It will be seen here that, in every case of samavayikarana, the simplest way of defining the cainal relation (karyakaranatyiava) wouldbe by referring to the cause itself as the common subs tratum (samanadhikarana) in which the antecedent andthe consequent under reference co-eaist. In Nyayadefinitions pf cau&ality, the common substratum kept
CH. i] PERCEPTION 157   
in view is generally suppressed; and the student ofNyaya has to find it out first before trying to interpret such definitions. It should be noted here that the Nyaya conception of samavayikorana, while it includes what the Vcdantins call the upadanakarana (material cause), is not exactly parallel to it ; because, upadana(material cause)is the substance which enters into the make-up of its product and this is true, in the Ny&yatheory, only in the case of the component parts andtheir composite product, and not in the case of a sub stance and the quality or activity arising in it, the cause and effect in the latter case representing fundamentally different categories.It should also be observed here that the phraseinherent cause, samavayikdrana, is somewhat misleading, in that it may lead one to suppose wrongly that it is the cause that inheres in the 
effect but the fact is thr.t the phrase here means 'a cause which is capable of producing an effect that inheres in it*. It may appear at first view that the 
phrase 'intimate cause* is a better equivalent ; but it turns out to be more misleading when the correspond ing phrase non- intimate cause comes to be used as the equivalent of asamavdyikarana, as may be seen presently from the next para. 
The phrase cu/imar Jv/foJrii>:a means a cause which, under no circumstance whatever, could be treated as a samavayikarana (inherent cause). Substances only can be treated as samav&yik&rana and they can never be treated as asamav&yikfirana. Qualities and 
activities only can be treated as asamavayjk&rana.
158 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
While the two kinds of causes inherent cause (samavdyi) and non-inherent cause (asamavdyi)are absolutely exclusive of each other, the third kind viz., .occasioning cause (nimittakdrana)includes causal factors which, while being the nimitta of certain effects anay well ba the inherent or non-inherent causes of certain other effects, as the case may be. The phrase non-inherent cause used as the equivalent of asama vdyikdrana should not be taken to mean that the cause referred to does not inhere in any substratum, since every non-inherent cause, on the contrary, inheres somewhere; but this phrase should be understood to stand for, like its Sanskrit equivalent, a cause which, under no circumstance whatever, could be treated as inherent cause. In defining the causality of a non-in herent cause, the inherent cause of the effect in ques tion should be kept in view as the common substratum(samdnddhikarana),inherence (samavaya) should be referred to as the relation determining the presence of the effect in questionin the common substratum (kdryatdvacchcdakasambandha), and either inherence 
or co-inherence (samavdya or ekartha-sanuwaya)should be referred to as the relation determining the presence of the cause in question in the common subs tratum (kdranatdvacchedakasantbandha). The con junction of threads (tantusarhyoga) is the non-in herent cause of cloth; and in that case, the commonsubstratum is thread; the relation connecting cloth with such substratum is inherence; and likewise, the relation connecting the conjunction of threads with such substratum is inherence; this is one type ofnon-in-
OH. i] PERCEPTION 159   
4ierent cause. Another type of non-inherent cause is to <be found in the colour of the threads forming the com ponent parts of a cloth ; in this case, the colour of the 
threads is the non-inherent cause of the colour of the .cloth; the common substratum is the cloth; the relation connecting the effect with such substratum is inherence 
and the relation connecting the cause with it is co inherence. It should be remembered here that, accord ing to the Nyaya-Vaiseika system, the special qualities >(visesagunah) of soul (atman) should not be treated as non-inherent cause in the case of any effect, thoughthe general definition of such cause holds good in the -case of knowledge in relation to desire, of desire in relation to voluntary decision or effort (yatna) and in such other cases. The chief reason why the special qualities of soul should not be treated as non-inherent cause in the case of any,effect is that, in all such cases, it would be simpler to treat the contact between the soul .and the mind (dtmamanassamyoga) as non-inherent cause and in the case of any effect, more than one non inherentcause need not be recognized. In view of this, in the general definition of non-inherent cause given in the text, it is necessary to introduce the qualification that such cause is different from the special qualities of soul { &tmavise$agunabhinnam ). 
The atomic hypothesis of the Nyaya-Vaieikasystem and the creationistic view of oausation main tained in that system are closely bound up with each other. The Nyaya-Vaisesika theory of causation is known as aratnbhavddd (creationism) as distinguished from the parindtnavdda (evolutionistic view of causa*
160 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
tion) of the Samkbyas. In the Nyaya-Vaisesikasystem, 'to come into being' means 'to spring up at acertain point of time and not to have existed before'; for this reason, the Nyaya theory of causation is known as asatkdryavdda. The expression asatkdrya vdda, according to Naiyayikas, means 'the view that every effect is invariably preceded by its antecedent non-existence' and it should not be understood to imply that an effect arises out of nothing. On the contrary, according to the Nyaya theory, a positive product(bhdvakdrya) is invariably preceded by a causal machinery, the full complement of which includes several positive antecedents and two negative antece dents,^., the antecedent negation of the effect in ques tion (kdryaprdgabhdva) and the absence of counter acting causes (fratibandhakdblidva}. The Naiyayikasare anxious to repudiate the suggestion that their theory of asatkdryavdda implies that an effect mayarise out of nothing; and they point out that antece dent negation (prdgabhdva) would be inconceivable without thinking of a suitable anuyogin (correlated substratum ) and pratiyogin ( counter-correlative ) , and that in the case of prdgabhdva, as in the case of annihilattve negation (dhvamsa), while the effect itself represents the latter, the inherent cause (sawav&yikdrana) represents the former. Invariable concomitance between an antecedent and a consequent(nfyataptirvavartitva) and absence of such circum stances as would justify the idea that the antecedent in question is not indispensable (ananyathdsiddhatva) these are the two essential elements in the Nyaya con-
CH. i] PERCEPTION 161   
cept of causality. The former, according to theNaiyayikas, is generally made out through a know ledge of the invariable sequence between two positive factors (anvayasahacara) and of the invariable con comitance between the negations of those two factors (vyatirekasahacdra). The formula for anvayasaha~cdra is usually stated thus: "Whenever C precedes, Efollows"; and that for vyatircksahacara thus; "Whenever C does not precede, E does not follow/* The latter formula is intended to serve as a corrective to the former and effectively eliminates the mistakewhich may arise through an exclusive adoption of the former formula and which consists in mere co-exist*- ence or sequence being taken for causality. There arecertain cases where it is not possible to make out negative concomitance (vyatirckasahacara); for ins tance, where a cause, like God, is ex hypothesi present everywhere and the invariable antecedent of every conceivable effect, the negative formula of vyatireka cannot possibly apply. In such cases, the affirmative formula of anvaya alone is available and dependedupon. In all other cases, the Naiyayikas insist that causality should be determined through an application of both the formulas of anvaya and vyatireka. Wherethese two formulas are applied to instances falling1 within the range of direct observation (fratya'ksa) andas a result causalityis made out,it is said to be madeout through praiyaksa. Students of Western logic, who
are familiar with the experimental methods formulated by Mill for determining causal relations, may be able to
162 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
(find in the combination of the Nyftya formulas ofG#vaya and vyatireka a parallel to what is known as the /*jfil method af agreement and difference. The Naiya ylfcas are keenly alive of the difficulties in determining causality, which are brought about by cases of plurality of causes and intermixture of effects. They contend that, strictly speaking, there can be no plurality ofcauses or intermixture of effects. If fire appears to be the effect of straw (trna), or tinder-sticks (arvni), orlens (wow), the fact is that the same effect is not pro duced from these three causes and the effect in each case has different properties. Such differences in effects may be apparent in certain cases and may be subtle andiiave to be noted with care in others. In a similar way, Che effects of different causes may be mixed up; and in such cases, these effects should be carefully distinguish ed. The Naiyayikas are never tired of remindingthemselves and others of the need for carefully observ ing and making out the relation of invariable concomit ance between particular classes of antecedents and^consequents, as also between their negations. Thisaaeed is embodied in Udayana's dictum "Concerning4ie truth about the affirmative and the negative con comitance, one should he particularly careful" (tattve fyRtntwatQ bhavyam wvayavyatire&ayoli).It is con tended by the JTaiyayikas that our experience of several things as existing only during a particular period of time and never existing before that time in other words, as being kadacitka in their nature cannot be satisfactorily explained except by assuming causal rela tion between such things and certain antecedents. The

causa) factors also-r-gpme pf them at least should themselves be occasional (kaddcitka) and contingent, for the reason that, otherwise, the prior non-existence 
of the effects in question cannot be accounted for. This would mean that a beginningless chain of causes and effects should be admitted ; and the Naiyayikas donot hesitate to say that the stream of causes and effects is beginningless (karyakaranapravaho'nadih), for the simple reason that the starting point,if any, of the causal stream lies far beyond human ken. 30 
T (a) Of those prainanas, 
perceptive instrument (prat 
yaksa)is the means of percep 
tion. 
(&) Perception is the cogni 
tion which is produced through
sense-organ coming into relation 
with an object.It is of two
kinds: indeterminate anddeter 
minate. 
(c) Indeterminate percep 
tion is a cognition which docs 
not involve any attribute or
adjunct (prakfra). 
(d) Determinate perception 
is cognition which involves an
attribute or adjunct. It is em 
bodied in propositions like 
"This is E>itthtf\ Tbtf ii a
164 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PARTin   
Brahmana", "This is black9', 
"This is a cook". 
The definition of perceptive instrument (prat ya&sapram&na) is based on Gautama's sutra 1. 1. 4, which runs thus : indriy&rthasannikarsotpannam jnanam avyapadesyam avydbhicari vyavasayatma kam pratyaksam". This s&tra may be rendered thus: "Perception is cognition which arises through sense-organ coming into relation with object, and which is non-verbal, unerring and of the nature of ^dubious knowledge". The Sutrakara is evidently defining valid perception (pratyaksapramd)in order to definitely indicate the nature of the instrument of valid perception (pratyaksapramana). According to the earlier interpretation of this sutra, as given in Vatsya yana's bhafya, the adjunct 'unerring' (avyabhicari) excludes erroneous perception; and the adjunct 'indubi ous1 (vyavasQyatwaka) excludes doubt. The adjunct 'non-verbal' (ovyapadesyd)in the sutra is understood in various ways by different scholiasts. Some of the old scholiasts take this adjunct to mean 'not coming within the scope of expressions referring to objects' (sabda karmatdm dpannam na bhavati yat) ; and in this sense, it differentiates perceptionas described by the expres sions referring to objects from perception as it arises, the former having become objectified as prameya andthus ceased to belong to the subjective sphere of pra mana (valid cognition). Some other Naiyayikas of anearly school would take the adjunct 'non-verbal' (avyapdefya) in the sense of 'not being caused by wordCH. i] PERCEPTION 165   
in association with sense-organ* (anubhayafaorfabdaksobhayajabhinna) ; and, in this sense,it should be understood as excluding cases where the meaning of a word is made out through the perceptual observation of the way in which an object is referred to by that word, or in other words, cases where a word is first made out to be significative of a certain objectthat is actually being perceived by a sense-organ. In such cases, they hold that the cognition in question should be brought under verbal cognition (sfibda} and not under perception. Another set of early Naiyayikas f (like Jayantabhatta) would take avyapadesya in the sense of asabda (non-verbal) and would explain its purpose as consisting in saving determinate perception (savikalpaka?) from being merged in verbal cognition (sdbda) on the ground that the cognitive process involved in such perception invariably results throughthe operation of a sense-organ in association with the recollection of a scheme of words with which the knower happens to be familiar. Vacaspatimisra andseveral others who follow him 'would take the wordavyapade&ya (non-verbal) and vyfivasay&tmaka (definite and determinate) as referring to the two kinds of perception viz., indeterminate (nirvikalpaka) anddeterminate (savikalpaka). They maintain that the former adjunct (avyapadesya) refutes the view of the grammatical philosophers who refuse to recognize nirvikalpaka and hold that knowledge is impossible except though some language and no objectis cognized by itself and without being associated with the wordsignifying it (Mi so'sti pratyayo loke yatra iabdo na
1<6& A PRIMER OF ItffclAtf LOGIC [PxfcT m  
The latter adjunct (vy&vasaydtmaka) , they further maintain, refutes the Buddhist doctrine that indeterminate perception (r.irvikdpaka)is the only genuine type of valid perception and that all determinate 
cognitions (savikalpaka) are illusive. The last expla nation given by Vacaspatimisra and his followers is generally accepted by later Naiyayikas and Gautama'ssfttra dealing with perception (I. 1.4) is believed 10 presuppose both the types of perception determinate 
(savikalpaka) and indeterminate (nirvikalpaka). What exactly is the nature of indeterminate pecep tiofc and how does it differ from determinate peception? The answer suggested by Annambhatta's definitions of nirvihalpaka and savikalpaka, which follow Gangesa'sview, may be explainedin this way. In the first place, it should be remembered that the Nyaya distinction of erroneous cognition (bhrawa) and valid cognition (pramft), which is intended to apply onlyto cognitions leading to some activity (pravartaka), holds good only in the case of determinate cognitions and cannot haveany reference to indeterminate cognitions. The relation of object and subject (visayavisayibhQva) involved in a determinate cognition is a definite complex consisting of three correlated phases adjunctness (prakaratti)* substantiveness (viSesyata) and relationness (samsar g&t&). In an indeterminate cognition, on the other b&ftd, there is the relation of object and subject; andwhile a thing, its attribute such as a generic feature (//*) and their relation are presentedin it, they arenot presented in a specific manner in their respective forms as a qualified substantive (viscfya), as a qualify-
CH. i] PERCEPTION   
ing attribute (vifesantf) a!nd as a relation of a definite type (samsarga). Such indeterminate cognitionshanre only to be inferentially arrived at through determinate cognitions, on the basis of the observed causal relation 
between a cognition of a certain attribute (vifef^n^jnana) and a complex cognition of a thing as havingthat attribute (viSistajtitina). On this ground,the determinate cognition of a jar, for instance, one cannot possijly have without previously having an indeterminate cognition in which the substance in question,its generic attribute and even their relation are presented in a vague and undifferentiated form. Indeterminate cognitions are therefore said to be alindriya (beyondthe scope of any sense), while determinate cognitions are generally perceived by mental perception (m&nasa*pratyaksa) and presented in anuvyavas&ya. It mayalso be noted that a nirvikalpaka can never be directly expressed in a proposition and that every proposition* according to Naiyayikas, embodies and conveys a deter minate cognition (samsargavagahijndnaor 
The grammatical philosophers (fabdikas)as already stated, refuse to recognize nirvikqdpoka. Allthe otlier philosophers recognize the distinction betweennirvlkalpaka and savikabpakain one form or other. Inthe first place, the Buddhists hold that the nirvikalpako is the only form of valid perception and it cognizes the absolute, unrelated, momentary existence called svalak sana (the mere thinu-in-it$elf); while the determinatecognitions (savikalpvka) arc illusive in that theyinvolve wholly fictitious fabrications (vikalp* of
168 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
fialpana), which usually take the forms of a namei(n&ma), a generic attribute, (/dtf), a quality (guya), an activity (kriya) and a substance (dravya). TheAdvaitins hold that indeterminate cognition (nirvikal fiaka) may arise from propositionslike 'This is that Devadatta' (so'yam devadattah) and 'That thou art1 (tat tvam asi); and that the absolute existence alone (sanmatram), which is identical with Brahman, is pre sented in indeterminate cognitions (nirvikalpaka). TheMimamsaka view of nfrvikalpakais that it is an indeterminate perception which consists in the direct and simple awareness of an individual object (vyakti) and its generic attribute (j&ti) which arises immediate ly after the sense-organ comes into relation with them;and that it misses the definite feature of the jati as being common to several individuals belonging to a particular class and the specific character of the vyakt \ as being different from others i.e., the element of anuvrtti in the former case and of vyavrtti in the latter case. This is closely similar to the old Vaiseika viewof nirvikalpaka. Prasastapada describes indeterminate perception as simple awareness (tilocanamatra) andKumarila, in his description of it, uses the same expres sion and compares it to the unverbalised dumb experi ence of a child or a dumb person. Indeterminate perception is only to be inferred like any other cognition, in the view of Bhattas; while it is presented in itself along with the knower and the known object, as in the case of other cognitions, according to the Prabhakaras.The Vedantins of the Visisjadvaita school adopt the Prabhakara view of indeterminate perception and main-
CH. i] PERCEPTION 169   
tain that every cognition, however simple it may be, involves a substantive, an attribute and their relation; that both sdm&nya (generic attribute) and vie$a (the 
individual vyakti)are presented in nirvikalpaka alongwith difference in the form of the individual object (vyaktisvarupa); and that, at the stage of nirvikalpafca, the knower does not realize that the generic attribute pre sented in his knowledge is common to all the individuals belonging to the same class and that these individuals are different from the individuals belonging to a different class, and he is not, therefore, in a positionto articulate his indeterminate perception through verbal expression. 
The Advaitic view of nirvikalpaka that the abso lute existent (SattaBrahman) is the only thing whichis presented in it and that the highest form of truth realisation which leads to final emancipation is a nirtn kalpaka is an inevitable development of the doctrine 
of nirvikalpaka as adopted by the exponents of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system. The Nyaya-Vaiseika realists have shown how a permanent reality, and not a momen tary isolated 'this' (svalaksana or thing-in-itself) as in the case of the Buddhist theory of nirvikalpaka, may be presented in indeterminate perception; and it has thus become easy for the Advaitins to push the Nyaya theory of nirvikalpaka to its logical conclusion and to maintainthat the true nirvikalpaka is one in which Brahman, the only absolute and permanent reality,is presented. This 5s, indeed, one of the several instances in whichthe Advaitic Monist effectively uses a weapon made in
170 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PAUT iu   
the Nyaya forge against its maker himself to annihilate his pluralistic universe. Jayantabhatta, an authorita tive exponent of Nyaya, observes in a significant manner that the only way in which one may get out of the mess which various Indian theorists have made of the content of nirvikalpaka would be by adopting the view that the same reality that is presented in savifcal paka is presented in the nirvikalpaka, the only difference between them being that the former is invariably boundup with a linguistic scheme or verbal image while the latter is not and cannot be specifically articulated through any verbal expression. The sub-joined extracts from the Nyayamanj.iri (Viz. S. S. page 99)deserve a careful consideration in this connection: 
"Tasmad ya cva vastvatma savikalpasya gocarah ; Sa eva nirvikalpasya Sabdollckhavivarjitah. Kimatmako'saviti ccd yad yada pratibhasatc\ Vastupramitayascaiva prastavya na tit vadinah. Kvacijjatih kvociddravyam kvacitkarma kvacid gunah , 
Yadevasavikalpena tadev&nena grhyate. Iha tabdaMisandhanwnatramabhyadhikam param"The Nyaya-Vaiseika definition of pratyaksto 
(sense-perception) generally imibts that sense-data forra its essential feature and that it is invariablythe result of a special type of relation called s&ttnikarsa between a sense and an object. This definition takes into account only perceptual experiences which are pfo 
duted from certain causes and does not hold good in the case of the eternal omniscience whidi is also called
CH, 1} PERCEPTION 171   
and which is ascribed to God. Strictly speak 
ing, the etymology of the word fraiyaksa would sup port its application only to perceptual experiences arising from the senses. However, usage has extendedthe term to all cognitions which are characterised byimmediacy. God's omniscience has the highest degree of immediacy conceivable. So, in order to cover nitya pratyafesa, also, perception is defined as a cognition which does not arise through the instrumentality of another cognition ; (jnanakaranakam jnanam prat yaksam). It should be remembered that, though a determinate perception arises from an indeterminate perception, the latter does not operate as karana
(efficient instrument). 
It would be desirable to consider here whether per ception, in the sense in which it is used in the Nyaya*Vaiesika system, may correctly be called intuition. Without misapprehension, the term intuition may be used with reference to perception (pratyaksa), only in the sense that it possesses a comparatively greater degree of immediacy, as compared with non-perceptual cogni tions. If intuition should be taken to exclude absolutely mediacy of any kind whatever, the praiyaksa of the Nyaya system, which arises through a special kind ofrelation between an object and a sense-organ, cannotbe callel intuition. In the strict sense of the termintuition, it may be proper to use it only withreference to what is sometimes called pratibkd or the innate Capacity of the mind to immediatelyperceive certain things ; and it may also be appropriate to describe the Advaitic realisation of the one absolute
172 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
reality as intuition, in view of the fact that it results from the intuitive faculty of mind to perceive reality -coming to have a full, free and efficient play after the 
required preliminary discipline of studying and under standing (fravana),reflective thinking (manana) andconstant meditation (nididhyasana).In fact, in the Nyaya system, all knowledge is mediate in a sense, except the eternal knowledge ascribed to God, evenindeterminate perception depending upon the mediationof a special kind of relation between sense-organ andobject ( indriyarthasannikarsa ). 
The Bha^ta MImamsakas adopt, for all practical purposes, the Nyaya definition of perception andwould, like Naiyayikas, lay special stress on indri 
ysrthasannifcarsa. The Prabhakaras, on the other hand, define perceptionas 'direct awareness* (sdksat pratltih)', and according to them, even recollection* inference and such other cognitions, usually considered non-perceptual in their character, are really perceptual 
on the subjective side, in so far as they themselves andthe knower are concerned (svSmie jnatramse ca), though they are non-perceptual on the objective side, in so far as their objects are concerned (visayatnse). The Advaitic theoryof perception rightly points out that the Nyaya view gives undue prominence to indri ytirthasannikarsa and belittles the importance of the element of immediacy which ought to be treated as the essential element in pratyaksa. The Advaitins seek to remedy this defect by treating sense-relation as anantecedent necessary only for certain kinds of percep-
CH. i] PERCEPTION   
tion and by insisting that immediacy consistingin subject-object-unity is the essential feature of all per ceptual forms of experience, and not sense-relation. Consistently with usage in language,ihe Advaitins dis tinguish the pratyaksatva (perceptuality) of a cogni tion from the pratyaksatva (perceivedness) of anobject. They describe cognition (jfiana) as pratyaksa(perceptual experience), when it comes to be unified for the time being with its object,in the sense that consciousness as conditioned by cognition (pramana caitanya or vrttyavacchinnacaitanya} becomes equatedwith consciousness as conditioned by object (visaya caitanya). In a similar way, they describe an object 
(visaya) as pratyaksa (perceived), when the knower(pramdtrcaitanya) becomes equatedwith object or consciousness as conditioned by object (visayacaitanya)* It maybe noticed here that the idea that immediacy in the sense of subject-object-unity forms the essential element in pratyaksa has turned out to be wholly foreign to Nyaya realism, mainly because the relational schemeon which the realistic edifice of Nyaya is erected con sists entirely of external relations, and because the object-subject-relation (risaymisayibhtlru),in parti cular, is conceived of as being entirely external in its character, chiefly with a view to keeping the dangerousidealist always at a safe distance.

When a jar is perceived by
the sense of sight, the sense 
relation is 'contact'. When the

relation is 'inherence in a thing 
which has come into contact', 
the jar, in that case, having
come into contact with the visual 
sense and colour being connected 
with the jar through the relation 
of inherence. When colourness 
(rtipatva)in the colour of a jar 
is seen, the sense-relation is 
'inherence in what is inherent in 
a thing which has come into 
contact'; for, in that case, the 
jar has come into contact with
the visual sense, the colour of
the jar inheres in it and colour 
ness inheres in colour. 
When sound is perceived by
the sense of hearing, 'inherence' 
is the sense-relation; for, the 
ether bound within the auricular 
orifice is the auditory sense,. t] PERCEPTION 175   
sound is a quality of ether, and
the relation between a quality 
and its substratum is inherence. 
When soundness (sabdatvd) is 
perceived by the auditory sense, 
the sense-relation is 'inherence 
in a thing which inheres'; for, 
soundness inheres in sound
which inheres in the auditory 
sense. 
In the perception of non 
existence, the adjunct-substan 
tive-relation is the sense-relation ; 
for in the case jf the visual per 
ception which takes the form 
"The seat of the non-existence 
of jar is floor", the 'non-exis 
tence of jar' is an adjunct to 
the floor with which the visual 
sense has come into contact. 
Thus the cognition which 
arises from one or the other of 
these six sense-relations is per 
ception ; and sense-organ is its 
efficient instrument (Tarawa), 
Therefore, the senses constitute 
the efficient instrt^nent of per 
ceptual experience (pratyakfa*

[THUS ENDS THE CHAPTER ON PERCEPTION]*
176 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC   
In the foregoing portion of the text, the schemeof sannikarsa adopted by the Naiyayikas is set forth. The term sannikarsa is used in a technical sense; it is not a mere relation, nor is it exactly contact, for the word 'contact' is generally taken to be equivalent to samyoga. It would be correct to describe sannikarsa as a special type sense-relation which determines and constitutes the extent of the perceptive reach or range of the sense-organs. In Nyaya literature, the term sannikarsa is generally used in this technical sense. The scheme of sannikarsa set forth above relates to normal perception (laukikapralyaksa) and com prises normal sense-relations (laukikasannikarsa}. The Nyaya-Vaisesika theory rcpii'dintf the nature and constitution of the sense-organs (indriya) is already set forth on pages 65, 66 and 68 supra. According to the Naiyayikas, the visual sense (fafow/i), constituted as it is by light, travels to the spot where the visible objects happen to be and visualize them and it is there fore said to be prapyakarin; the remaining senses are said be aprftyyakarin,in the sense that they do not leave their place but, remaining where they are, they perceive the objects which come within their reach. Some early exponents of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, like Jayantabhajta and Srldhara, hold that all the senses are pr&pyak&rins> in the sense that they function with reference to objects within their reach, it being immaterial whether a sense reaches an object or an object reaches a sense. Samavdya (inherence)is
CH.I] PERCEPTION 177   
recognized as a distinct type of sannikarsa in order to account for the auditory perception of sound. TheNyaya theory of the perception of sound (fabdaprrt* yaksa) is already set forth and explained on pages 101 to 104 supra. The Nyaya view regarding the percep tion of non-existence is that, through the help of effectual non-cognition (^iiyytihHpalaltilii), a sense organ perceives the non-existence of an object which is perceptible to it. As a rule, a sense-organ which perceives an object can also perceive its j&ti (generic attribute) and its abhava (non-existence). The Nyayaview regarding this matter is usually expressed in this Sanskrit dictum "Yenendriyena yd vyaktih grhy^ie% tannistha jatih tadabhavasca tenendriyenaiva grhyate". It is necessary, in this connection again,to refer to pages 45 and 46 su'fira. The relation of v\$e$ana visefyabhava, which is recognized as the sannikarfa connecting non-existence with a bense-organ, is, in fact, an indirect relation iiuvliin^ one or the other of the 
other sannikarsas. For instance, in the visual percep tion of the non-existence of jar (ghat&bh&va) as adjunct of the empty floor (bhutala),the visual sense comes into contact (samyoga)with the empty floor with which the non-existence of jar is connected as adjunct ; so, the complete chain of sannikarsa, in this case, is not mere vise$anata, but caksussamyuktavife- $anata (being adjunct to a thing with which the visual sense has come into contact). 
In the case of iriner perception through the inner >ense (antarindriya)called manas,it is necessary to
178 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
recognize three distinct sense-relations; viz., samyoga,samyuktasamavaya and samyuktasamavetasamavdya, in order to account respectively lor ihe mental perception (mdnasapratyaksa)of the soul (atman),of the cogni tion in it and of cognitionness (jnauatra).In connec tion with the auditory perception of sound (fabda) and soundness (fabdatva),it is necessary to iccognize two distinct sense-relations : viz., samavaya and sawa vetaswnav&ya. The sense relation of visesanavisesya bhava is necessary to account for the perception of 
non-existence. Would it be necessary to use the first three sense-relations (samyoga etc.)in accounting for external perception through the external senses other than the auditory sense? No substance which does not possess at least the minimum degree of mahattva(largeness) can be perceived by an external sense; and in the case of every external perception of substance or quality other than sound, association with mahattva is a necessary condition. So, in all cases of external perception, except auditory perception, one has to take into account only composite substances (avayavin), from a triad (iryanuka) upward.It would appear that, in such cases, the first two sense-relations may be dispensed with, and the third samyuktasamavetasama v&ya would be quite adequate to account for any per ception. For instance, the visual perception of a triad of earth (prlhivitryanuka) or its colour (rtipa) or its colourness (rfcpatva) can easily the accounted for by taking sathyuktasamavetasamovGya as the sense-rela tion;this chain should be understood in the first case (tryanuka) as consisting of contact between the visual
CH.I] PERCEPTION 17$   
sense and the atoms, the inherence of dyads in those atoms and the inherence of the triad in those dyads J the first link in this chain in the second case (r&pa) is contact between dyads and the visual sense; and m
the third case (rupatza) ,the first link in this chain is contact between the triad and the visual sense. To the above question, the Nyaya theorists replythat the first three sense-relations are indispensable and explain thei^ necessity in this way. Take, for instance, visual percep* tion ; the conditions of visual perception such as udbh&* tar&pa (perceptible colour) and mahattva (largeness) should be regarded as the co-existing determinants 
(avacchedaka) of contact with the visual sense (indriya samyoga) ; it would not do if they are associated in somemanner with^ffie object visualized; otherwise, the earth* ness (prihivltva)in the atoms of earth and the blueness 
(nllatva) in the blue colour \\ -i , :: to an atom of earth should be visualized, the former (prthivltva) being asso^ ciated with largeness (mahattva) in a jar and the latter (riilatva) being associated in some manner with large* 
ness through the blue colour of a jar; or otherwise, as a result of indirect association with mahattva andudbhfttarftpa in a jar, the jati called sattft should bevisualized in air (vdyu) as well as its touch (sparSa); in order to avoid these absurdities, mahattva and stui other conditions in the case of visual perception should be referred to as avacchedaka (co-existing determinantof contact with the visual sense (caksttssamyoga),in all cases of visual perception ;In these circumstaftcel^ it becomes necessary to leave entirely out of account: contact between the visual sense and atoms or djads;
WO A PRIMER OR INDIAN LOGIC [PAIT id   
thus, samyoga, samyuktasamavaya and samyuktasama fttastmav&ya are shown to be indispensable iti account ing for external perception of a substance (dravya), LU Duality (guna) and the generic attribute (;<Hf ) in the quality. 
The scheme of six sense-relations explained above relates only to cases of normal perception (laukika- }r#tyaksa} and these sense-relations are called laukika so*nikar$ah (normal sense-relations). In the case of perception through the external senses, the complete icheme of relation necessary to bring about perceptual experience consists of contact between soul and mind, mind and sense-organ and sense-organ and object (atmama*as& samyujyate, mana indriyena, indriyam wtkena). The first of these three factors viz., con tact between mind and soul (dtmamanassamyoga) is a general condition of knowledge (jndnasantanya). In cases of m&nasapratyakfa (inner perception through the internal sense-organ manas), this general condition tfftelf (Atmamanassamyoga)assumes the specific formof sense-relation (indriyarthasannifcarsa). 
The Naiyayikas also recognize three types ofauper-normal perception (alaukikapratyakja), as aris ing from three kinds of super-normal sense relations {((wawSfJ&arannfftar^a),vis., the relation of sense bound generality (samanyalabsanasannikarsa), the relation of sense-bound cognition (jMnalafifanasainm 
and the relation of yogic power (yogajasanni-. In NySya literature, the word prattf&satti is also used in this context, as the equivalent of santti-

(dhftmo vahnivyabhican na va) ; such a doubtrelates to all smokes and all fires ; only a particular smoke and a particular fire happen to be seen in the hearth; the perceptual doubt referred to arises throughthe visual sense and presupposes the visual perception of all smokes past, present and future, in the hearthand elsewhere (dhtimas&manyac&ksusflni) ; the normalsense- relations of contact (samyoga) and inherence in the thing in contact (samyuktasamavaya)are esta blished between the visual sense on the one side, and onthe other side, the particular smoke and smokene**(dkttmatva) in it; no normal sense-relation can beshown to connect the visual sense with all the smotas;in this situation what happens is that the visual percep tion of the generic feature, smokeness (dhtimatvfi) which is present in the particular smoke normally con nected with the visual sense and which is common to ajl smokes, serves as the super-normal link (&laukikas<mn\- karsa) through which all the unobserved smokes ar*f in the first instance, connected with the particular actually observed, and through the latter with sense which has already come into relation with it in anormal way. Thus s&mdnyda&santsanm&arf* is $supernormal sense-relation which immensely <xten4$ the perceptive reach of sense^rgan and 'brings  
182 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
classes of perceptible objects within its scope when onlyparticular individuals of a class have actually comewithin its reach. The word s&m&nya in this context means any common attribute (samanadharma) and not necessarily a j&ti\ even a jar, for instance, may be treated as the samGnya of all the places having a jar. The earlier view is that the phrase samanyalak$aiia should be understood in the sense 'consistingin s&m&nya' (samdnyasvarufia} and that this variety of super-normal sense-relation consists in the commonattribute presented as adjunct (prakata)in the cogni tion of a substantive (visesya) which has come into normal relation with the sense-organ. (Indriyasambad dhavifesyafcajnonaprakaribhit tarn sawtinyam sanni kar$ah). This view is defective; for, it does notcover, for instance, the super- normal perception of all the places having a particular jar which has ceased to exist and which is remembered as the common attribute (sam&nadharma)of all such places. In that case, onevisualizes through the super-normal (s&m&nyalakfana)sfcnse-relation all the places having the particular jar which no longer exists (tadghatavatah sarv&n pra def&n), while seeingin the normal way only one ofsuch places without the jar and while recollecting theparticular jar previously seen in that placein the normal way. Tadghata (the particular jar)is the common feature in that instance; if s&m&nya itself Were to be understood as constituting the neededstnse- relation, sdmdnyalakfanasannikar^a would not be available there, for the reason that the particular jar representing the sam&nya no longer exists; but if
CH. i] PERCEPTION 183  
cognition of sdmdnya (sdmdtiyajndna)should betreated as sannikarsa, the required sense relation in the form of recollection (sdmdnyasmarana) would be avail able. For these reasons, Naiyayikas of the later school take the phrase sdmdnyalaksana to mean 'having sdmdnya as object', the word laksana being taken in the sense of object (vipaya) ; and they hold that it is cognition of sdmdnya (sdmdnyajndna) that constitutes the super-normal relation in question.It should be remembered in this connection that while (sdmdnya jndna) avails as super-normal sense- relation in internal perception (ndnasapratyaksa) under all circumstances, it avails as such in external perception (b&hyapratyak$a) only when the conditions necessary for bringing about the normal perception of the sdmdnya in question are present. ( Tadindriyajataddharmabodhastimagryapek sitd.) For instance, one can have a super-normal inner perception (alaukikamdnasapratya'ksa) of all smokes through the recollection of smokeness (dh&- matva), even in darkness ; but, in darkness, one can never have a super-normal visual perception (alauki kacdksusa) of all smokes through the sdmdnyajndnaconsisting in the recollection of smokeness (dhtimatva smarana). It may also be stated here that one could not become omniscient (sarvajna)for the mere reason that one could have super-normal perception of all knowable things (prameya) through the cognition of their common feature knowableness (jnrameyatva), since omniscience (s&rvajnya) consists in a detailed and full knowledge of all things and not in a general, knowledge of them.
A PRIMER OP INDIAN LOGIC [PART mA person sees sandal ; his sense of smell does not function for the moment and his sense of sight alone functions ; he sees not only sandal but also its fra grance; his visual perception assumes the form "the sandal is fragrant" (surabhi candanam), and he is conscious of the fact that he is seeing the fragrant sandal. In cases like this, no normal sense-relation (laukikasannikarsa) between the visual sense and fragrance can be recognized and the presentation of fragrance (saurabha)in visual perceptionas an adjunct of sandal has to be accounted for by means of the super-normal sense-relation (alaukikasannikvrsa) f which consists in the recollection of fragrancesmelt in the sandal on a previous occasion. This variety of super-normal sense-relation is called jnanalaksanasan mg0. By means of s&m&nyajndna (cognition of acommon attribute) representing s&manyalafcsanasanni karsa> it woiiid be possible to account for fragrance bting brought within the scope of the visual perception of sandal, the requiredsense-relation being fotmi in the cognition of fragranceness (saufabhatva) the generic feature Of fragrance. But the presentation of &aura~ bhatva in the visual perception of sandal cannot be accounted for by means of s&m&nyalatisan<isannikars6> since saufabhatva is a fati and is therefore presented in cognition as adjunct by itstlf (svarupatah) and not as delimited by any attribute. In this case, it becomesunavoidably necessary to recognize jnGnalatsanasaHni k&rsa as distinct from samdnyal&ksana. Further, wherea person mistakes nacre for silver in visual perception and has the anuvyavasayaf l see silver*, silvernessCH. ij PERCEPTION IHS   
(tajatttva) is presented in the inner consciousness of visual perception through jfi&nalaksana, and not through sam&nyalafcsana; for, in the latter case, the generic attribute, whose cognition is proposed to be treated as sannifearsa, should be present in the subs tantive (vifesya) actually perceived, and in the present instance^ silverness is not present in the nacre which is seen. On these grounds, the Naiyayikas maintain that jnanalaksana should be taken to form a distinct type of super-normal sannikarsa. They also hold, on the strength of the evidence furnished by the Yogaf&stra, that the super-normal capacity, which the mind(manas) acquires througli the yogic practice, constitutes the third variety of alaukikasannikarsa described as yogajadharmalaksana. This variety of super-normal sense-relation enables any sense to reach any object. 
The Nyaya theory of alaukikasannikafsa seeks to account for certain cognitions which really stand' on the border line between ordinary perceptual cognitions and non-perceptual cognitions and wouldappear to be more akin to the former than to the latter. The Mimamsakas and the Advaitins are not in favourof this theory and refuse to recognize any special type of pratyaksa known as alaukikapratyakf&. These oppo nents of the Nyaya theory argue thus. Universal judgments relating to smokes and fires in general terms are the result of the synthesis which a thinker's mindis capable of making; this synthesis is sometimes effect ed through a negative process and sometimes through a positive process; in the case of a negative synthesis,, particular individuals only are observed and brought
186: A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PxiT ill   
into relation with each other as determined by certain generic features, the individualities of the individuals being entirely ignored for the moment; such a negative synthesis may well be brought under normal perceptual process (laukikapratayksa).In positive synthesis, a generalisation of all the conceivable individuals, with 
out ignoring their individualities, is definitely contem plated and is effectuated by the thinker's mind passing from particulars to universals; the mental process in volved in such a positive synthesis is essentially one of inference. In cases like the visual perception of sandal as fragrant (surabhi candanam), one may see easily a jumble of visual perception of sandal and recollection of fragrance through association of ideas. Even in the case of yogic perception, what happens, in fact, is that the normal reach of the mind comes to be immenselyextended by yogic powers through the great potentiali ties of the mind becoming actualised in experience; andall instances of yogic perception may be accounted for, without the help of the theory of super-normal sense relation, either as ntanasapratyaksa (inner perception) or as vivid recollection of the past, or as vivid imagi nation of future possibilities. Mtmarhsa theorists dis card the doctrine of yogic perception altogether. 
However, it should be observed here that the Nyaya theory of alaukikapralyak$a (super- normal per ception) rests on reasons which should not be lightly brushed aside and which are worthy of very careful consideration. In the first place, it may be noted that, in every case which a Naiyayika would bring under the
CH. i] PERCEPTION 187  
super-normal variety of perception, the mediacy whichis characteristic of non-perceptual cognitions is entirely missing and the immediacy- which is characteristic ofperceptual cognitions is invariably felt to be present. In cases of external perception, where cognition of a
or cognition of some other kind is treated as rsd) the mind is entirely subordinated to a sense and if certain impressions derived from previous ex perience get mixed up with perceptual elements, such impressions come to be divested, for the time being, of their non-perceptual character and invested with a sense-bound, perceptual garb. The inner consciousness (anuyyavasaya) of disciplined minds, which takes a form like this "I sec a fragrant sandal" (surabhi can danam pasydmi), is certainly an evidence which the KTaiyayikas feel bound to respect and rely upon, in this connection.

fIt would be interestingto note here how the Njayfirealist deals with the criticism that all knowledge mayy in a sense, be brought under inference and that evenperceptual experience may be brought under inference* It may well be contended that, in the visual experience
190 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
of a composite structure like a horse, only certain parts of the animal come into relation with the sense of sight and several parts do not, in fact, come into relation with the sense; and that in such cases, the experience 
of the whole, of which we become conscious, must betaken as inferencer^Gautamahimself refers to this contention in II ]K-31 and indicates how this difficulty inay be met by using the N) aya theory that the com posite whole (avayavin) is entirely different from its parts (avayavah). /The Nyaya theorists claim that their conception of paTts and whole as entirelydifferent entities has as its chief advantage the preservation of the province of pratyaksa from being wholly swallowedup in the province of anumana.j 
In the case of every pram&na, the karana (special or efficient instrument), the vydpdra (intermediatecause) and the/>/*a/a (final result) should be carefully distinguished. In the case of anumana (instrument ofinferential experience) the knowledge of co-extension (vy&ptijnana} is karana; substimptive reflection 
(paramarfa) is vyapara; and inferential experience(anumiti) is phala. 
Students of Nyaya, before they proceed to study the Chapter on anum&na, should start with a clear con ception of the meanings of the technical terms paksdf sadhya and hetu or sddhana. They are usually rendeF ecTrespecilvely by theTEnglish equivalents minor term, major term and middle term.

Thus, one may see in the Indian terminology itselfevidence of a fundamental difference in the wayin which the topic of inference is treated in Indian logic as compared with the way in which European tradition deals with that topic such difference consistingin greater stress being laid on the material aspects ofinference by the exponents of the Nyaya-Vaisetkasystem and undue stress being laid by European tradi tion on the formal side of syllogistic expression. 
Annambhatta defines anumili as a cognition pro duced by subsumptive reflection (parfimarfa). This definition, as it is, may be applied even to a perceptual 
experience following a doubt and arising from a sub sumptive reflection. With reference to a man standing at a distance, a doubt may arise in twilight, as to whether he is a man or a post. As one approaches the object, the cognition "This object has hands and such other features as are found invariablyassociated with
192 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [flu? m  
humanity'1(purufatvavytipyakaradimGn ayam) arises; and immediately follows the perceptual experience "This is a man" (ayam purtt$ah). Such cases of sam$ayottarapratyak$a (perceptual decision following a doubt) and arising from the reflective perception of certain particulars (vise$aparamarsa) are not instances of anwniti and have to be excluded by the adjunct 'in Association with the pakfattf (pak$atQsahakrta) so that foe complete definition of anumiti will be this nAtiumitiJiS a cognition which is produced by subsump tive reflection in association with subjectness 
What is paksatG (subjectness)? The earlier school of Nyaya understood subjectness as consisting in 'doubt regarding the presence of probandum'
(sddhyasandeha) or, in other words, understood a paksa to be the substantive with reference to which onedoubts whether one may correctly predicate something or not. This view of pak$ata ignores the fact that s&dhyasandeha (doubt regarding prodandum) is not a necessary condition of inference and that a person whohas actually seen clouds on the sky may also infer their presence from their peal of thunder. The later Naiyayikas seek to remove this defect in the earlier definition of paksata and suggest a modified definition which may be stated thus: "Pakfatd, (subjectness) amounts to the absence of such indubious knowledge ofthe probandum as is associated with the absence of adesire to establish the probandum" (sifddhayiftiviraha pakfata). In experience, it is
CH. 11] INFERENCE   
found that indubious knowledge of the frobandum(sadhyasiddhi) prevents inference unless there is apositive desire to arrive at the same result throughinference. Sadhyasiddhi is thus a counteracting agent preventing animiti (anumjtipratibatodhaka) andsi$ddhayi$d neutralises the influence of the counter* acting agent and is therefore uttejaka. Pak$ata thus reduces itself to non-existence of such counteracting agent as is associated with the absence of the 
neutralising agent (MttejakdbhdvaviSistam yat prati bandhakam tadabhavah}. When the Naiyayikas include pal^ata in the causal equipment necessary foi anumiti, they do not assume anything unusual, but are simply applying to the specific effect, anumiti, the general principle that uttejakabhavavitistapratl* bandha'kdbhdva is one of the things making up the causal complement of an effect. It must be remem*bered that universal sadhyasiddhi in every conceivable instance of fiaksa prevents the inference of the sanre sddhya in some of the paksasas also in all paksas i whereas partial sadhyasiddhi in some tfaksas prevents only the inference of the same sddhya in some pakfas. Universal s&dhyasiddhi is technically"described as paksafavacchedakavacchedena sadhyasiddhi and may be embodied in a proposition like this"All S is P '\ Inference of the same sddhya in all paksas is likewise described as paksatavacchedakavacchedetoa anumiti and embodied in a proposistion like this<* All S is P ". " Some S is P" a proposition of this type embodies partial sddhyasiddhi, which is technically described as 
fralteQtavacchedakas&mtinadhikaranyena sddhyasiddhi. 13
194 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
An inference which may be embodied in a propo sition like "Some S is P" is prevented by anys&dhyasiddhi, universal or partial, while the inference in the form "All S is P" is prevented only by uni versal sddhyasiddhi. It should also be remembered that, when the conditions necessaryfor having the perception of a certain object are present along with those neces sary for inferringthe same object, only the perception of that object arises and not its inference; but in cases where the conditions necessary for perceiving an object are present along with those required for inferring another object, inference would arise and not perception. 
The Naiyayikas insist that, in every case of infe rence, quick or slow, inference for oneself or inference for others, subsumptive reflection (jMamgri^^jL^nindispensable anTeeed^nt"^lnct^"sTiould, therefore, be treated as cause of anumiti.

jft&na.^In the stock example of inference "The hill hasTire; because it has smoke", the pardmarsa takes the form "The hill has smoke, which is invariably con comitant with fire" (vahnivydpyadh&mavdn parvatah) ; ^nd it is contended by the Naiyayikas that, in the absence of such a pardmarfa, anumiti does not arise. This cognitive complex called pardtnarfa is also knownas lingapardmarsa or trtiyalingaparamarfa (thethird cognition of the reason). The cognition 6f the presenceCH. n] INFERENCE 195   
of the lingo, (reason)in the subject (paksa) may be said to be the first lingapardmarfa; the cognition of the in variable relation between linga and sddhya is the second lirigaparamarsa; and the complex cognition which arises from these two cognitions is the third lingapardmarSa. 
The MImamsakas and the Vedantins who follow them hold that the complex cognition called pardmarSais not indispensable for anumiti, though it mayactually arise just before anumiti in many cases. In our experience, we are conscious of having anumiti directly after becoming aware of the presence of the hetu (reason) in the paksa (subject) and rememberingvydpti (invariable concomitance) and without anyintervening pardmarsa. In such cases, the Naiyayikas also cannot help recognizing causal relation (kdrya kdranabhdva) between anumiti on the one side and the two .,": referred toon the other side (vydpti jndna and paksadharmatdjnana} ;and in cases wherepardmarsa intervenes, they should recognize another causal relation (kdryafcaranabhdva) between pardmariaand anumiti. Thus the MImamsakas argue and maintain that, in order to avoid this difficulty,it would be neces sary to treat anumiti as the effect of vydptijndna andpak$adharmatdjndna and to exclude pardmarSa fromthe causal complement of anumiti. The Naiyayikas, however, point out that it would be much simpler to connect every case of anumiti with pardmarsa as its cause and to assume that, even in cases where anumitiappears to arise directly from vydptijndna and pa%fa~dharmat&jndna, there is an intervening pardmarSathough one may not be conscious of it on account of the
196 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
quick passage of the mind from the stage of paksa dharmatdjfidna to the stage of inference. The con troversy between the Mimarhsakas and Naiyayikas, as to whether anumiii should be taken as the effect of the two cognitions vydptijndna and pak$adharmatdjfidna or as the effect of the complex cognition called para marfa, appears to hinge on the principle of parsimony(Idghava) and turns out to be a consideration of the greater or smaller degree of cumbersomeness which onemight notice in the MImamsaka's or the JTaiyayika's way of defining the causal relation between anumiti and its cause. However, a careful estimation of the arguments advanced by the Mimarhsakas and the Naiyayikas would reveal the significance of the insis tence in Nyaya on pardmarsa being treated as indis pensable. If subsumption to a generalisation be the essential element in inference, it is obvious that infe rence of fire in a hill cannot arise from the perception of smoke in it, until the particular smoke in the hill is subsumed under the generalisation involving vydpti between smoke and fire; and the Naiyayikas insist that subsumption is the essential feature of inference and insist therefore that every anumiti should betaken to be preceded by pardmarta, which is but a subsumptive reflection subsuming the smoke in the hill under the pre-established vyapii. The Bhatta Mimarhsakas, onthe other hand, hold that it is the subsultive, rather than the subsumptive, passage of the mind from the observed relation of particulars to a certain unobserved particular, that characterises the inferential process of thought; and this view accounts for their attitude
CH. n] INFERENCE 197  
towards partimarSa. From the following exposition of vyapti, the difference between the views of the Mimamsakas and the Naiyayikas would become further clarified. 
What .is vytipt4? Annambhatta's definition of vyaptijisLthat it consJtjJjxJj}Ji4/tf (reason or probans) being co-existent with the sadhya (probandumor the ining to be "Tn ferentiall} "Vstablislied ) ,which is per

Firstly,it implies that fire and smoke co-exisXJnthe particular form and throughthe particular relation, with reference to which they are intended to be treated as hetu and sadhya respectively, the particular form of hetuandsddhya being technically called hetutavacchedakadharma and sadhyatdvacche dakadharma and the particular relations intended to determine the co-existence of hetu and sadhya being technically known as hetuidvacchedakasambandha andsddhyatdvacchedakasambandha. Secondly, it implies that, with reference to the same hetut&vacchedaka dharma, sddhyatdvacchedakadharma, hetutdvaccheda kasambandha and sddhyatdvcchedakasambandha, fire is never the counter-correlative (pratiypgin) of anynegation which co-exists with smoke. Where fire in a hill is inferred from smoke, fire is sadhya, fifeness
198 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
(vahnitva) is said to be s&dhyat&vcchedakadharma in the sense that fire is proposed to be treated as sddhya in its general and universal form as fire, andnot in any other form such as that of a substance (dravya) ; smokeness (dhumatva) is said to be hetuta vacchedakadharma in the sense that smoke is proposed to be treated as hctu in its general and universal formas smoke, and not in anyother form; and conjunction or contact (samyoya) is said to be sadhyatavacchcdaka sambandha, as also hetutaracchcdakasambandtoa, in the sense that fire and smoke, in their respective form as sfidhya and hetu, are proposed to be treated as connect ed with paksa (subject), through the relation of con tact, and not through any other relation such as inherence (samavaya)or self-linking relation (svarupa). 
In later Nyaya literature, based on Gangesopa dhyaya's Tattvacint&mani, two types of definitions of vy&pti are distinguished, one type beingcalled siddhanta laksana and the other type beingcalled purvapaksa iaksana or purvapaksavyapti. The definition explained in the preceding para representsthe former type and is briefly set forth in this Sanskrit formula: Hetuvya pakasSdhyasanianQdhikaranyam vyaptih. This defini tion, when fully amplified, comes to include the hetutavacchedakadharma, sadhyatavacchedakadharnta9 hetutdvacchedakasambandha and sadhyat&vacchedaka sambatodha. It is affirmative in its main form, the latter half being affirmative, though the adjuncthetuvyQpaka reduces itself to the negative form hetu sam&n8dhikarandtyantabhavdpratiyogin ( which is
CH. 11] INFERENCE 199   
never the counter-correlative of any negation co-exist ing with the reason). 
The other type of definition of vyapti is known aspnri'apaksalaksana in the sense that it is provisional and prima facie satisfactory. It is generally putin anegative ^form. A typical instance of pftrvapahsavydptiis this: Co-extension (vyapti) consists in non-exis tence of the probans in every place where the probandum(sadhya) does not exist (sadhyabhavavadavrttitvam).This definition also, when fully amplified, comes to in clude the hetntavacchedakadharma^adhyatavacchedalta dharma, hctutavacchcdakasambandha and sadhyata vacchcdakasambandha. This prima facie definition ofvyapti is negative in its main part and is a direct amplification of the conception of avinabhava. Thecontrast between the tv/o phrases avinabhava andsdhacaryaniyama should be clearly understood. Theformer phrase is more commonly used in earlier N> aya literature and the latter in later literature. Vin&means 'without'; a-bhava means non-existence; anda-vina-bhava means non-existence (of the probans or helu) without or in the absence (of the probandum or sadhya). This is the basis of purvapaksavyapti whichis generally negative in its form. The other phrase sdhacaryaniyama which is used by Annambhatta is equivalent to niyatasahacarya, \\ hich means invariable co-existence. This forms the basis of what is referred to above as siddhantavy&pti. The prima facie defini tion of vydpti set forth above is defective. It does not hold good incases where the sadhya happens to he a
200 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
thing whose non-existence anywhere is inconceivable (kevalanvayl) ,like abhideyatva (namableness) ; nordoes it apply to the hetu in syllogisms like: "A quality (guna) has existence (satta), because it has a generic attribute (jaii)".It will be seen that non-existence of the probans in a place where the probandum does not e&ist can be conceived of only when its existence in 
such a place through the specific relation in view (helutavacchedakasambandha) is conceivable and that, in the latter instance referred to, the presence of the ptobans, jati, through the relation of inherence, whichis the specific relation in view, in a place like sdmanya-jwhere the probandum (satta)is not present, is incon ceivable. In order to get over difficulties of this kind, thesiddhantalaksana or conclusive definition of vyapti is put forward. 
The term vyapti literally means pervasion and lays stress on the universal character of the relation Tceptin view. The phrase 'universal connection' ""brings' out exactly the meaning of the term vyapti. In"" early "Nyaya literature, Ihe term avindbhava is frequently used as the equivalent of vytipti. It should be observed that this term, avinGbhSva, brings into prominence the invariable character of the relation kept in view. Thetwo ^concepts, universality and invariableness, implj ^Scfi other; but they are not identical. A careful 
xlraination of early Nyaya literature would show that, from Kanada and Gautama downward, all the leading exponents of the Nyaya- VaiSesika system were quite familiar with the ideas of universality and invariable-
CH. n] INFERENCE 201-   
ness as forming the essential elements in the conception of vyspti. Vatsyayana, who preceded Dignaga, defini tely makes use of the conception of avinabh&va in his Bhasya on the sutras 2-2-1, 2-2-2 and 2-2-61. Thevery conception of vyabhicGra as a fallacy (hctvabhtisa) presupposes the invariableness of the relation called avinabhdva or vyapti. Patanjali, in his Mahabhaya
(on 3 2 124), shows a definite knowledge of the universal character of the relation called vytipti. In the face of these facts,it would be unreasonable to hold, as Professor Keith does, that the doctrine of 
indissoluble or invariable relation (avindbhava) is Dignaga's special contribution to Indian logic and that Prasastapada and others borrowed this idea fromDignaga and developed it. In this connection, atten tion is invited to the article on "The evolution ofvydpti'' contributed by one of my former pupils, Mr.A. S. Krishna Rao, M.A., in partI Volume I, (1927)of the Journal of Oriental Research, Madras. 
What is the exact nature of the relation of vy&pti, or avinabhdva? How is it arrived at? Is it arrived at through perceptual experience? Or does it represent itself the result of an inferential .process? If vydpti in 
its universal form is the basis of inferential reasoning* does it not already contain in itself the result of the inferential process and does it not render inference wholly superfluous? Questions like these were raised and answered both by Naiyayikas and Mimarfisakas of
the early and later schools. It would be of great value to students of Indian logic to pay some attention to
202 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
these questions. Vatsyayana remarks in his Bhasya on1-1-37, that the parallelism between the probans as found in the paksa and the probans as found in the example (udaharana), on which the probative character of the probans rests,is very subtle and diihcult to explain and can be well understood only by men of great learning. (Tadidam heiudaharanayoh ^sadhar myam paramasak$Mam duhkhabodhain panditarupa vedaniyamiti). The Bhasypk&ra sa>s this, not because he was quite innocent of the nature of the invariable or universal relation called avlnabhara or vyafpti, as Professor Keith and some others may fancy, but because, perhaps, he was keenlyalive to the difficulty in satisfactorily answering the questions raised at the beginning of this para and to the snares and pitfalls in the way of generalisation. 
Uddyotakara, Vacaspatimisra, Jayanta and someother early writers on Ny&ya describe vy&pti as an un conditioned or necessary relation which is not broughtabout by any adventitious circumstance anaupadhikahsambandhah. For instance, that smoke is pervaded byfire, i.e., that dhunia is vahnivyCipya*\$ a necessary and un conditioned relation and does not depend upon any adven titious circumstance; whereas, the relation of vyapti embodied in the proposition 'Wherever there is fire, there is smoke' is not a necessary and unconditioned relation and depends upon the association of fire withthe adventitious contact of wet fuel with fire (Urdren dhanasamyoga). Such adventitious circumstances are called upddhayah. An upadhi is an adventitious factor which is invariabiy concomitant with the p
CH. n] INFERENCE 203  
(s&dhyavydpaka) and not so with the probaw(sadhanavyapaka).It is called u'p&dhi becabse asUdayana explains, its invariable concomitance with the probandum comes to be erroneously associated with the probans, just in the same way as the redness of a japQ (China rose) is erroneously associated with a crystal (sphatika-) in its vicinity. To define vyapti as anau pddhikasambandha is significantin several ways. In the first place, it shows that the earlier schools of Indian logic, which adopted this definition, do not defi nitely insist upon any conscious process of generalisa tion or universalisation preceding inference. Secondly, according to the early schools, it should be made out that the connection between the probans (hetu) andprobandum (sddhya)is necessary. Thirdly,in order to satisfy oneself that the connection in question in volves necessity, one should know that it is not due to association with any adventitious circumstance, i.e., that it is w&bhavika and not aupddhika. Further, this definition clearly lays greater stress on the element of necessity in the relation between the hetu and sddhyathan on the element of invariableness. It should, how ever, be remembered, in this connection, that Gautamawho recognised vyabhicdra or absence of invariableness as a fallacy, and Vatsyayana and Prasastapada whodefinitely referred in their works to the concept of avindbhdva as an essential element in anum&na, werefully alive to the importance of the idea of invariable ness in vyapti. 
What is the form in which the relation of vy&pti comes to be known and leads to inference? How does
204 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
it come to be known ? According to Annambhatta, whofollows GangeSopadhyaya in this as in several other matters, the cognition of vyapti (vy&ptijfi&na) atise&in the form of a universal generalisation which is usually embodied in the proposition "Wherever there is smokethere is fire" (yatrayatra dhumah tatra vahnih),or in the proposition "Whatever has smoke, has fire" (yo yo dhumavan so'gniman) ;in a statement of vyapti, the vy&pya (pervaded)should be first referred to and the vydpaba should be the principal predicate; aijcj the cognition of vyapti arises usually from the observation ofTfie co-existence of smoke and fire in one or moreinstances, in the absence of any knowledge of a place where the hetu is present and the sddhya is not present' Annambhatta criticises the view that the relation of in variable concomitance is known through bhuyodarsanaor repeated observation. As Nllakantha points out, the Sanskrit phrase bhtiyo'darsana is ambiguous. It may refer to the frequent repetition of the same obser vation or to observation of several instances of the stidhya and hctu or to observation of the co-existence of the sddhya and hetu in several places. In any ofthese senses, though the observation of the co-existence of hetu and sddhya may be repeated a thousand times, vy&pti cannot be made out, if, even in a single instance, the hetu is known to be present in the absence of the stidhya. So, following the Manikara, Annambhattapoints out that a knowledge of the co-existence of the hetu and sSdhya in association with the absence of a knowledge of the presence of the hetu where the s&dhyais not present (vyabhicdrajnanavirahasahakrtam svha-CH. n] INFERENCE 205  
c&rajnanam) causes vyaptijnana. Knowledge of vya bhicftfa may arise in the form of a doubt or one maybe sure of the presence of this defect. In the latter case, unless it is shown that such knowledge is erro neous, one cannot make out the relation of vyapti. In the former case, any doubt, of vyabhicara, which is otherwise technically known as aprayojakalvasankd andwhich is usually expressedin the form ''Let there be the A<?/; the sadhya need not be present" (heturastu sadhyam mastu), is removed by an indirect type of reasoning known as tarka. The indirect argumentcalled tarka corresponds to rcductio ad absurdum and consists in showing how the assumption of the oppo site leads to an absurd result by coming into conflict with some established truth. In the case of invariable concomitance between smoke and fire, for instance, if one should doubt that smoke may be present some where in the absence of fire, the indirect argument of tarka may be put forward in this form: 'If smokewere present in the absence of fire, smoke could not be produced by fire. But the causal relation between fire and smoke is a well-recognized fact'. Thus according to later NTaiyayikas, vy&pti is a universal type of gene ralisation covering all conceivable case.-, Totii otacTvcd and unobserved.

fin several instances the universal relation of vyapti is feir"to be arrived at as perceptual experience (pratyaksa) through some sense-organ. Perceptual ex perience persupposes some sannikarsa (sense-relation) between the sense concerned and the objects comingwithin the scope of the experience in question. Y/hen, for instance, one comes to have visual perception of the relation of invariable concomitance between all smokesand all fires, it is through the super-normal sense-rela tion (alaukika-sannikarsa)called samdnyalakfana praty&satli that all the smokes and.jfires are broughtwithin the reach of the visual sense.) The nature of this super-normal sense-relation is explained in pages 180 to 184 of Chapter I, supra. Thus, according to later Naiyayikas,the knowledge of vyapti arises in several cases as super-normal perception through the super-normal sense-relation of seme-bound generality 
(s&manyalaksanasannikarsa). Jayantabhatta discus ses the nature of vyaptijiiana in pages 121 to 123 of his Nyayamafijari (Viz. S. S.) and arrives at the conclusion that it arises through the inner sense, manas,as mental perception (manasapratypTtfa), when co-ex istence is observed and no hitch in such co-existence is 
seen. Evidently, Jayantabhatta is inclined to think that manas, though it cannot directly reach external objects (bahirasvatantram manah) under ordinarycircumstances, is resourceful enough to reach all the smokes and fires, both observed and unobserved, in the
CH. n] INFERENCE 207   
absence of definite obstacles in the way. Jayanta, how ever, does not account for the mind's resourcefulness in this direction and seems to be inclined to attribute it to its nature and not to the aid of any super-normal sense-relation known as samanyalaksanasannikarfa. The nature of this sannikarsa has been explained in detail on pages 180 to 184, in Chapter I, supra. 
Buddhist logicians like Dignaga and Dharmakirti lay particular stress on the negative phase of vytipti viz., non-existence of the probans in the absence of the probandum (avindbhdvd). They hold that every case of avindbhava involves a necessary and indissoluble connection between the hetu andthe sddhya and that this connection is based uponidentity (tdddtmya) or causality (tadutpatti). TheNaiyayikas rightlycriticise this view as ignoring such cases of invariable concomitance as do not rest uponidentity or causality cases like a blind man's inference of colour (rupa) from taste (rasa). 
The Mimarhsakas of the Bhatta school maintain that vyapti, in the form of a universal generalisation, is not a necessary condition of inference. Fire is observ ed to be co-existent with smoke in two or three places; and smoke is never seen to be present in a place wherefire is not present When one comes to have this experience repeatedly within the sphere of one's obser vation, one finds oneself in a position to make outinvariable connection between smoke and fire in the form in which they happen to be seen in the particular instances which have come within the scope of one's
208 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in observation. When one later on happens to see smokein the same form in an unobserved place as in a place already observed, or even when one happens to see smoke again in the same form in an observed place asalready observed there, one's mind comes to have a knowledge of the presence of fire in that place wheresmoke is seen for the moment. The knowledge of fiie which thus arises cannot be regarded as perceptual experience as fire is not for the moment within the range of any of the senses; nor can it be regarded as reproduction in memory of a past experience, since the knowledge of fire which thus arises is felt to be experi ence having reference to the existence of fire in the present time. Thus, according to the Bhattas, the pro position 'Wherever there is smoke, there is fire' repre sents ordinarily a icstricted form of synthesis which has reference only to tlie observed particulars and is quite adequate as a condition of inference; and anybody who is equipped with the knowledge embodied in this   
proposition would be able to infer the existence of fire on seeing smoke in any place, provided there is no suspicion of vyabhicdra (presence of hetu in the absence of sddhya). At the same time it must be remembered that Bhattas do not deny that, not infre* quently, in the course of inferential reasoning, one mayarrive at a universal generalisation of the type recogniz ed by the Naiyayikas, which has reference to the invariable concomitance between all cases of hetu and s&dhya, including observed and unobserved instances in the present, past and future. The Bhattas, however, insist that such universal generalisations themselves are
Cn.n] INFERENCE 209  
cases of inference. Parthasarathimisra, one of themost reliable exponents of Rumania's views, explains the inferential process through which such universal generalizations are arrived at. In this connection, areference to Parthasarathi's Nyayaratnamala (Chow-,khamba edition pages 69 and 70) would show howunobserved places, which have smoke, may be inferred, to have fire, from the fact that smoke is predicated it* those places, on the basis of observed cases. In the face of this, it would not be correct to suppose, as Professor Handle does in foot-note (1)to page 282of his work "Indian Logic in the Early Schools ", that "there is nowhere in Indian Logic the notion that Induction or generalization is an inferential process". 
The Prabhakaras hold that vydpti is the invariable relation between hetu and sadhya, which, when it is made out, happens to be free from temporal and spatial limitations and thus comes to assume the form of a universal generalization. In the hearth, for instance contact between smoke and fire is made out as the relation connecting the two substances smoke and fire. In the cognition of such relation, the two relata are the two principal concepts. The relation on the one sid^ and time and space (kala and deia) on the other are presented in that cognition only as adjuncts subsidiary to the two relata. While two subsidiaries agree to subordinate themselves to a common principal, onesubsidiary does not ordinarily tolerate its subordina tion to the other subsidiary. This is as true in thesphere of thought as in the external world. Thus theknowledge of the relation between smoke and fire that
JWQ A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [P**T marises from the observation of their co-existence in particular instances takes a universal form, unhamper ed by the temporal and spatial limitations of the parti* cular place and time actually coming within the scope of observation. With the help of such a universal generalization, when a person infers fire in a mountainon seeing smoke there, he is, in fact, cognizing again ifrhat has already been cognized and forms part of the content of the generalization at which he arrived as a result of his observation. Such inference is valid ex perience (prama), though it cognizes something already cognized. According to the Prabhakaras/ all cogni tions other than recollection are valid (prama) and it is not necessary that a prama should cognize something fiot already cognized. Thus, the Prabhakaras maintain that inferential experience is re-experience and does fiot involve the passage of the mind from the known to the unknown, as is commonly supposed to be the case; but it involves merely the passage of the mind from a known object to something that is already known to be invariably connected with it. In the Prabhakarascheme of inference, even a single observation (sakrd dartana) is enough for having a knowledge of vy&pti and repeated observation (bh&yodarfana) is, however, useful in showing that the relation observed betweenhit* and s&dhya is not brought about by any adventi tious circumstance (upddhi).   
/Fjiffthe foregoing account it will be seen that all tWfleading schools of Indian philosophy are agreed ki A general way that generalization
CH.n] INFERENCE 211   
sents the ground-work of inference. The Naiyiyikasand the Prabhakaras take this generalization to be of auniversal type and to have reference to all the conceiv able particulars unobserved as well as observed. TheBhattas look upon this generalization as a synthesis confined to the observed particulars, which is arrived at by sinking all incompatible differences. For instance, according to the former, the generalization, "Whereverthere is smoke there is fire" has reference to every conceivable case of smoke and fire; while, according to the latter, this generalization represents a S)nthesisof all the observed cases and sinks such incompatible differences as are due merely to spatial and temporal
limitations.^) 
At a very early stage in the history of Indian logic, the Carvaka materialist, who recognizes only onepramana viz., pratyoksa. throws out against inference* the challenge that vyapti cannot he relied upon as the basis of anumana. The Carvaka's contention is that, if vyapti were to be restricted to the known or observed particulars, it would be impossible to have any infer ence regarding unknown or unobserved particulars for the simple reason that the latter are wholly different from the former ; and that, if vyapti were to be looked upon as a universal generalization having reference to all the conceivable particulars, unobserved as well as observed, all that has to be known is already knownand nothing remains to be known through inference* This objection is embodied in an old verse which is quoted by several old philosophical writers like SiHJtaniiba and Jayanta aod which rurts
212 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in  
"Anum&bhangapanke'smin nimagna v&didantinah. Vi&fe'nugam&bh&vah s&mdnye siddhas&dhyata.'* (Vide Prakaranapancika Benares edn. Page 71), The Carvakas contend that Indian logicians are hope lessly caught between the two horns of the dilemmaindicated they hopelessly sink down in this slough in which anumdna is lost. Students of western philoso phical literature are here likely to be reminded of the Empiricist's objection that any inference of a particular fact from a general principle already known and taken to be valid would amount to arguing in a circle. Theymay think in this connection of objections similar to what is put forward by Mill when he says "that noreasoning from generals to particulars can, as such, prove anything; since from a general principle, wecannot infer any particulars but those which the prin ciple itself assumes as known." 
To this kind of objection, the logic of the Bhattaschool, as may be evident from their view set forth above, gives the answer that inference is really fromparticulars to particulars and that, in cases where it appears to be from a universal to particulars, the real cause of such appearanceis to be found either in the fact that vydpti, constitutingthe basis of inference, assumes a general form, since such differences as areimmaterial, or incompatible, are left out for the timebeing; or it is to be found in the fact that a universal generalization interposes itself, though it does so as anintermediate inference. In this connection, a reference to Br^idley's Principles of Logic (pages 323 to 326) would
CH.U] INFERENCE 213   
be of great value. One may easily see that Bradley's criticism of Mill's view holds good as against the Bhattaview also, in a considerable measure. The Bhatfalogic, where it insists upon a very close similarity between the frobans in the paksa and the vy&pya in the sapaksa (example), reduces inference to reasoning from resemblance. But where it insists upon diffe rences being left out, the reasoning turns out to be onefrom identity. Is it not then palpable, cue may ask in Bradley *s language, that, when the differences are disre garded, the residue is a universal? The strong pointin the Bhatta view is that it shows how inference mayreally involve an advance in knowledge in two direc tions: where one infeis unknown particulars fromknown and where one inferentially arrives at a universal generalization from the observation of parti cular instances. 
As already explained, the Prabhakaras get over the difficulty under consideration by saying that every ex perience (ai ubhava) though it may not involve any newelement or any advance in knowledge, is valid (prantd). All that is required to show that anumana is a pramtinais that inferential cognition (anumiti) resulting from it is an experience (antt&hava) ,and not mere recollection (smrti). The Prabhakaras do not consider it necessary to go beyond maintaining that anumiti, though it hap pens to be a re-experience (gjhltagrahl anubhavah), is a valid experience.It should, however, be rememberedthat, according to them, vy&$ti assumes the form of auniversal generalization; and this is not because every
214 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [Pate in   
conceivable particularis brought within the scope of a supernormal observation, as the Naiyayikas contend, but because the elements of time and space do not enter into the scheme of relation represented by vy&pti, for the reason already indicated.

\The Naiyayikas, who are the generally accredited exponents of the doctrines of Indian logic, maintain that inference is not_frqmj^rticularsto .ajQ^culars but it is from 'universal to .p.articujys. They hold that

person may make out the rela

between smoke and fire and
arrive at the universal generali 
zation "Wherever there is 
smoke there is fire" from his re 
peated observation in the hearth 
and .such other places and then 
approach a mountain. He may
have doubt as to the presence of
fire in that mountain. On seeing 
smoke there, he remembers the 
generalization "Wherever there 
is soke there is fire." Then,
he comes to have the cognition

is pervaded by (or invariably

this cognition that is called linga

this cognition arises the inferen

fire; because it has smoke;

Professor Keith and some others believe that the above distinction of inference into inference for onself (svartha) and inference for others (parartha) wasfirst introduced by Dignaga and borrowed from himby Prasastapada. (Vide Professor Keith's' IndianLogic and Atomism', pages 106 to 108). A careful consideration, however, of what Vatsyayana says in his Bhasya and Gautama in his Sutras would clearly showthat the distinction in question should be held to be at least as old as the Sutrakara himself. Vatsyayana,where he speaks of anuwana as distinct from nydya prayoga, presupposes evidentlythe distinction of svariha and parartha. Gautama's description of the five members of a complete syllogistic expression wouldbe unintelligible, should it be assumed that he was not familiar with the substance of the distinction in ques tion, though the terms parartha and svartha are not found used in his Sutras. 
The distinction of anuwana into svartha andparartha is not only as old as the Nyayadarsana itself, but it is also one of the most vital topics in the KTyaya system. It is a natural result of one of the dis tinctive features of Indian logic and it enables intelli gent critics to appreciate duly the pivotal idea on whichIndian logic turns both in its scope and its development. It should be remembered here that Indian logic never allowed itself to be restricted in its scope and (fevelop ment to the exclusively formal side of ratiocination, but always kept in view as its constant, knowledge or, more accurately, knowledge of truth (tattvajfitina) in
218 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART inrelation to what is conceived of as the summum In this connection, it would be very interestinjfto consider what Benedetto Croce, one of the greatest contributors to contemporary philosophical thought, has chosen to observe concerning Indian logic, parti cularly the distinction of si'&rthanutnana and parar thanum&na recognised in Indian logic. Attention is invited to the subjoined extract from pages 583 to 585of Benedetto Croce's 'Logic as the Science of PureConcept' rendered into English by Douglas Ainslie.   
" This error, which appeared very earlyin ourwestern world, has spread during the centuries and yet dominates many minds; so true is this that 'logic'is usually understood to mean 'illogic' or 'formalist logic', We say our western world, because if Greece created and passed on the doctrine of logical forms, which wasa mixture of thoughts materialised in words and of words become rigidin thoughts, another logicis knownwhich, as it seems, developed outside the influence of Greek thought and remained immune from the forma list error. This is Indian logic, which is notably anti verbalist ...... Indian logic studies the naturalistic 
syllogism in itself,as internal thought, distinguishing it from the syllogism for others, that is to say, fromthe more or less usual, but always extrinsic and acci dental forms of communication and dispute. It hasnot even a suspicion of the extravagant idea (whichstill vitiates our treatises) of a truth which is merelysyllogistic and formalist and which may be false in fact. It takes no account of the judgment, or rather it considers what is called judgment, add what is really
OH. ii} INFERENCE 219  
the proposition, as a verbal clothing of knowledge;it does not mak^ the verbal distinction of subject, copula and predicate; it does not admit classes of cate gorical and hypothetical, of affirmative and negative judgments. All these are extraneous to logic, whoseobject is the constant, "knowledge considered in itself." 
Students of philosophical literature in the westmay find it easy to appreciate,in the light of the aboveextractfthe significance of the distinction which Indian logic recognizes between 'inference for oneself(svartha) and 'inference for others' (parartha). Thisdistinction is not merely one of a formal kind. It is rooted firmly on the fundamental doctrine of Indian logic that syllogistic reasoning should be viewed, not apart from the inductive process of thinking, but mere ly as a continuation and methodical application of it. In Indian logic, deduction and induction do not repre sent two mutually exclusive types of inference but they should always be looked upon as inseparably connected parts of a complete process of thinking called inference (anuinana) ; and the chief function of annmSna, as a means of valid cognition, is to enable one to realize how certain facts are inseparably and necessarily con nected with each other in accordance with a generalprinciple. This view of inference influenced the1 development of Indian logic for good and saved it fromfalling into the grip of formalism which, till very recently, dominated logicin the west. One of the chkf advantages which have accrued to Indian logic from this view is that it never makes the extravagant

The N>aya doctrine of five-membereH syllo gism is at least as old as Gautama and accepted byVatsyayana and Prasastapada, and almost all the later Naiyayikas and Vaisesikas. These five members are described in the following section of the text. T 33 
(a) The five members of a 
syllogism are: (1) the thesis 
set down (pratijnd), (2)the 
reason (hetu) t (3) the exempli 
fication (udaharana), (4)the

this is the subsumptive correla-
CH. n] INFERENCE 221 tion. "Therefore it is such"   
this is the conclusion. 
(6)In the case of inferen 
tial cognition for oneself as well 
as that for others,it is the sub 
sumptive reflection of the reason 
(lingaparamaria) that serves as 
the efficient and special cause 
(karana). So, HngapardmarSa
in this sense is the instrument of 
inferential cognition (anumana). 
Annambhatta's illustrative description of the five members of a syllogismset forth above, read together with the remarks in the dipika, throws adequate light on the function of each of the members. A typical pratifnd is in the form of a proposition consisting of a subject (paksa), which is already known specifically to bot,h the parties in a discussion, and a predicate which, in a specific form, is proposed to be established in the subject; in other words, it is in the form of a definite thesis to be maintained. Its chief purpose is to bring about a definite knowledge of the fakfa as such or what is proposed to be proved as having the pro&andum(sadkya). The person to whom the pratijnd is addressed would naturally desire to know first the reason why the paksa is said to have the sddhya; andto satisfy this desire, the linga or the reason whichserves to establish the sddhya in the paksa is indicated ordinarily by a term in the ablative case in Sanskrit* It would be possible to satisfy oneself that the reason
A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART n  
(linga) adduced is capable of proving the sddhya, only after ascertaining that the former is invariably con comitant with the latter; and the needed knowledge ofthe invariable connection between the probans and the probandum (vyaptijfiatia*) t on which the probative capacity of the yrobans depends,is derived from the statement of the example, which is usually in a formlike this: "Whichever has smoke has fire, as a hearth." The probatos which is made out to be invari ably concomitant with the Probandum (sddhyavyapya) should be specifically known to be presentin the paksa; without such a knowledge, the subsumptive process ofthought on which the conclusion rests would not be complete; and such a knowledge results from the member called subsumptive correlation (upanaya). The final statement of the conclusion called nigamana is not a purposeless reiteration of the thesis, as proved. The purpose of the nigam ana is to indicate that the probans is not vitiated by the presence <pfa counter-probCMS proving the contrary (asatpratipaksi tatva), nor stultified by a stronger proof (abadhitatva). 
According to Gautama and his followers, these five members are called avayavah in the sense that they form the necessary parts of a complete syllogistic 
expression. Vatsyayana, in his Bhasya, refers to andrightly discards an earlier view that the total numberof avayavas is ten vie., a desire to know the probate dum (jijMsS), doubt regarding the probandum or its reverse (samiaya), belief in the probability of the probandum and in the probativeness of the proof (sakyapraptih), the object of discussion
CH.II] INFERENCE 223  
and the removal of doubt on proving the probondum(samsayavyudasa),in addition to the five members ofthe Nyaya s\1l'-;,M*rr, already mentioned. Of th^se ten, 
the first five are only psychologicalconditions whichlead to a discussion and they cannot, in any sense, be said to be logical propositions forming the parts whichconstitute a complete syllogistic expression.It may benoted here that the Vaisesika tradition, as recorded byPrasastapada uses the terms/>ra/i/fl, apadeta, nidarfaita, anusandhana and pratyamnaya as the respective equi valents of the Nyaya terms pratijna, hetu, udaharana,upanaya and nigamana. 
Vatsyayana, the author of the Nyayabhasya, in his Bhasya on the first Sutra, equates nyaya with anvlksa, and explains it as amounting to a critical investigation of facts by means of instruments of valid cognition 
(PramSnairarthapartksanam nydyah). When such in vestigation is carried on in a methodical way so as to convince another person of a fact, it is expressed in the form of five-membered syllogistic expression which is described as nyayapratfpga or pancavayavavakya.Vatsyayana further explains, in his Bhasya on 1-1-1 and 39, how all the four Pramanas accepted by the Naiyayikas meet in the five-membered syllogism andtend to demonstrate a fact in a conclusive manner. TheBhasyakara points out that the statement of the thesis {pratijfta) may be taken to stand for valid verbal testimony (fabda),the reason (hetu) for the instru ment of inference (anum&na), the example (uddharana) lor the instrument of perception (pratyakfa) and the ti ve correlation (upanaya) for analogy (upa-
224 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART ra   
mdnd). According to him, one should find in the conclu sion (nigamana) the culminating stage of demonstrativeexpression for the reason that it is nigamana that showshow all the four pramanas have collaborated to maintain conclusively the fact in question; and on this ground, nigamana is described as the acme of logical demonstration (paramo nyayah).In order to appreciate fully the significance of 1 he Bhyakara's account ofny&yaprayoga as represented by the five-memberedsyllogistic expression described above, it should be remembered that the Naiyayikas, from Gautama down ward, look upon logic both as a science and art, that the function of logic, according to them, comprises both discovery and proof, induction and deduction, and lays adequate stress on the material and formal aspects of reasoning; and that logical debate, even in its apparent ly non-logical forms of jalpa (successful advocacy) and vitanda (destructive objection),is never allowed to stand completely divorced from the aim of nyaya, v\z.> conclusive determination of truth (tattvadhyavasaya). Remembering these facts, one may easily see that the structure of the five-membered syllogism is designed to meet in an adequate manner the requirements of logical demonstration, which seeks to convince another person by drawing his attention specifically to fact and by enabling his mind to pass through successive stages of thoughtwhich conclusively establish that fact. Professor Handle is inclined to believe that Vatsyayana thinks of the five-membered syllogism "as more than inference or the expression in words of inference" and that "the five-membered formula was influenced by its historicalCH. 11] INFERENCE 225  
origin in a nyaya which was methodological rather thanlogical and its structure must be regarded as in part vestigial, rather than determined by the requirementsof logical analysis." (Vide pages 165 to 167 of Pro fessor Randle's book 'Indian Logic in the EarlySchools'). The learned Professor's estimate of the five-membered syllogism of Nyaya and his interpreta tion of Vatsyayana's remarks in this connection canhardly be said to have given due weight to the fact that Indian logic, particularlyin its early stages as exhibited in the Sutras of Gautama and the Bhasya of V'atsya yana and in the connected early literature, never allowedvalid anumana (inference) to be divorced from other Pramanas, at any rate from the more important ofthem, viz., perceptual instrument (pratyaksa) andcredible verbal testimony (sabda), and that syllogistic formalism abstracted from induction is an aberration unthinkable to the Naiyayikas. A careful consideration of these facts would show that the structure of the five membered formula need not be regarded as in part vestigial. On the contrary, the considerations indicated above would show that this formula is based on anefficient and self-contained type of verbal apparatus which logical methodology has evolved for the purpose of demonstration. Professor Randle further observes that "either hetu or upanaya, and either pratijnd ornigamana are superfluous and this superfluity is inheri ted from the time when the Nyaya was a method of debate and not yet a syllogism : and in the case of the Nyaya school, the convention of five members mayhave been fixed by a desire to equate the four 'premises'
226 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
yviih the four Pramaijas." If syllogistic expression, Uks any other exj ression, directly or indirectly presup poses a hearer to whom it is addressed, if ny&ya$rayogaor syllogistic expression finds a place only in inference for others (\par&rthawimana) 9 and if the process of ^reasoning in inference for oneself (svarthanum&na)is not syllogising, a strictly logical debate, as recognised by Gautama and his followers, must involve a self-con tained syllogistic expression as its main part. Th$ a,im of such a self-contained syllogism is to enable th$ hearer, first to specifically think of what has to be demonstrated, secondly to learn what the reason is, thirdly to understand how the universal and invariable relation which forms the basis of inference is arrived at through observation, -fourthly how the reason actually relied upon is identical with what is known to be invariably concomitant with the probandum, andfifthly to realize that the probandum is conclusively proved by a probans which is not vitiated by a counter probans or by a stultifying proof. As already indicated, these five requirements can be fully met by the five members of a syllogism, viz., J>ratijfi&, helu, udaharana*Wpanaya and nigamana, It wll be seei> from this that the five-membered syllogism of Gautanaa, far fromfqmprising any superfluous member, is the only com*plete form of syllogistic expression which would enable a hearer's mind to pass in a methodical way througheach of the five stages of demonstrative reasoning, as indicated above. 
The Nyaya theory of five-membered syllogism mayhere be compared with the theory of three members
CH. n] INFERENCE 387   
(avayav&h) put forward by the Mimariisakas and th Buddhist theory of two members. The Mimamsaka$maintain that either pratijna, hetu and ud&haraiia, or udaharana, upanayck and nigamana will do; for, the conclusion should be specifically stated and a knowledge of the general relation between the probans and the probandttm and of the presence of the probansin the pafcsa (vyaptiand pafcsadharmata)is necessary, andthese requirements are fully met by the three membersabove-mentioned. The Buddhists hold that syllogistic expression is only an aid to reasoning and that it wouldbe unreasonable to assume that any hearer endowedwith the minimum capacity for reasoning would require more than the members conveying the needed informa tion about vydpti and paksadharmata, and that the tWQmembers necessary for that purpose, viz., the example and the subsumptive correlation (udaharana and npa naya) would be quite adequate to form a sjllogism. It may also be noted here that the three-membered syl logism of the Mimamsakas, represented by the latter alternative, viz., udaharana, upanaya and nigamana, may be regarded as a close parallel to the Aristotelian syllogism of the Barbara mood. The Naiyayikas wouldcriticise the three-membered syllogism of the MSniarii sakas and the two-membered syllogism of the Bauddhasas incomplete and truncated, for the former, when it consists of pratijna, hetu and udaharana omits to makeprovision for equating the probaws in the paksa with' the vyapya and for obviating any possible suspicion ofa counter-probans or a stultifying proof (satpratipaKi satva or badka) ; while, in the form which consists of
228 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART in   
ud&harana, upanaya and nigamana, it startles the hearer by a generalization without adequately preparing him; and the latter adopted by the Bauddhas combines all these defects. 
It may be noticed that all the schools of Indian logic the Nyaya, Mimamsa, Bauddha and the other schools agree in regard to the importance and value of the example (uddharana) as a member[of syllogistic 
expression. Ordinarily, udaharaya is in a form like this "Whichever has smoke, has fire, as the hearth." Its aim, according to the Naiyayikas, is to show howthe generalization on which deduction rests is arrived at. Consistently with this aim, the former part refers to the universal connection between the probans and the probawdum and the latter partrefers to a typical ins tance in which the co-existence between the hetu and s&dhya may be observed. Nyaya tradition, which must have influenced Gautama's mind when, in his Sutra 1-1-5, he proceeds to give an account of the different classes of anumana after referring to it as tahpurvakam (presupposing or resting upon pratyaksa), should have also left its stamp, in the shape of specific instance, on the pivotal part of the five-membered syllogism, vis., uddharaya. Some writers on Indian logic, who lose sight of the distinctive features of the Nyaya doctrine 
of syllogism, regard the udaharana as a useless and clumsy excrescence. Some others would historically account for the present form of the ud&harana by treat Ing it as result of the portion expressing the generaliza tion (vy&pii) coming to be combined at a later stage in the history of Nyaya with the latter portion referring
CH.II] INFERENCE 229  
to a specific instance, the original form of uddh^ranabeing merely like this :as a hearth (yathatnahfr basah). It may, however, be pointed out here that if Gautama's Sutra defining uddharana (1-1-36)is correctly interpreted, it cannot be held to convey any thing other than this: that udaharanais a typicalins tance (drstdnta) which, on the strength of the invari able connection observed in it between the probafts andthe probandum, enables one's mind to pass in the patosa from a similar case of the probans to a similar case ofprobandum. If it is true that, from the days of Gau tama, the inductive basis of deductive reasoning hasbeen treated by the Naiyayikas as an integral part of acomplete syllogism, it must be accepted that the wdfl harana as known to Gautama and his followers com 
prises both the parts, viz., the part representing vydpti and the part referring to a typical instance, and neither the former nor the latter of these two parts can be held to be a later addition. The logic of Nyaya seeks to combine discovery and proof; the Nyaya syllogismis 
such a harmonious blend of induction and deduction as ensures the safe progress of thinking on right lines ; and if, sometimes, the syllogism of Nyaya is abused in Indian philosophical speculation, it is certainly due to the fact that the basis of syllogistic reasoning in such cases turns out to be a superficial or unsound induction and not to any defect in the scientific method of reason* ing formulated by the Naiyayikas. 
Students of western logic, when they comparethe Nyaya syllogism with Aristotelian syllogism, are not likely to miss the striking contrast between
280 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC   
theifi. This contrast consists in the Nyaya systemlt tecognizing anything really corresponding to thfe syllogistic figures and moods known to westernlogic. Ordinarily, the generalization on which thetypical Nyaya syllogism rests is a universal affirma tive proposition, the proposition corresponding to the minor premise is usually stated in the form of Aandthe conclusion is also usually in A, So, it may be said that the typical Nyaya syllogism is of the Barbara type* In this Connection, a student of Nyaya, familiar withthe distinction made in Nyaya literature betweenp&Ttsat&vwchedakasamanadhikaranyenanumiti andpaksat&vaccheddkavacchedenanumiti may feel that there is some reason to find in the former case a con clusion in I and to connect such conclusions in I with a minor premise in I; thus, in such cases, he may feel inclined to find instances of the mood represented by Datii. In the same way, one may be inclined to find an instance of the mood Camestres in a syllogism like this 
-"Whichever has negation of fire has negation of smoke. No tank has fire. No tank, therefore, has smoke". But a careful consideration of the Nyayatheory of syllogism in the light of the NySya viewregarding the interpretation of propositions would makeit clear that, strictly speaking, it would not be correct to find in any Nyaya syllogism, a parallel to anywestern figure or mood. CJtlfi Nygyg conception of a typical syllogism is that it depends chiefly upon a pro poaitiojn embodying vyapli. Vyapti is ftn invariable or univtrpal generalization in the sense that it consists in unfailing connection between a probans and
CH.H] INFERENCE Hi  
looked upon as attributes predicated of certain subjects rather than as things having such attributes. The Nyayaview is generally in favour of adopting the 'intensive orconnotatio'tfal method of interpreting propositions andmostly avoids the extensive or detootational method^When a proposition like "All S is P" has to be inter preted by a Naiyayika, he would first think of the uff versal and invariable connection between the essential attribute connoted by S and that connoted by P andwould not so readily think of all the individuals denotedby S and P. It would also be remembered in this connection that there is no fundamental difference between a vyafiti of two positive factors and that of two negative factors. In fact, the proposition "Wher ever there is no fire, there is no smoke" is for all practical purposes taken by the Naiyayikas to be equiva lent to "Wherever there is negation of fire, there is negation of smoke". A Naiyayika would have as little hesitation in saying "Negation of fire is" (vahnya bhavo'sti) as in saying "Fire is*' (vahnirasti), abhdvaor non-existence being as much a real category as a bhftva ot positive entity. In these circumstances, onemay easily see how Indian Nyaya did not attach muchimportance in syllogistic reasoning to the artificial dis tinctions of A, I, E and O propositions, though the Sanskrit language was quite capable of expressing suchdistinctions, and how the formalistic formulas ofdifferent figures and moods cahie to be almost com pletely eschewfed in Indian logic.

In section 34 of the text given above Annambhattaexplains the three types of probans recognized bythe Naiyayikas viz., the affirmative-negative probans(anvayavyatireJsi),the exclusively affirmative (kevalan vayi) and the exclusively negative (kevalavyatireki). The Advaita-Vedantins insist that there is only one type<of probans, viz., anvayi (affirmative) and that inference arises always through subsumption to an affirmative generalization. The Bbattas, though they are inclined to recognize the anvayavyatireki and kevalanvayi types of probans, are generally in favour of bringing the kevalavyatireki type under a distinct pramana called arthapatti. The MImamsakas maintain that a negative generalization (vyatirekavyQpti)is fit to be treated as the basis of a presumptive conclusion (arthapatti) and only an affirmative generalization admits of beingtreated as the basis of a subsumptive conclusion (otttmt'ti). In this connection, it would be desirable to peruse again pages 140 to 146 (partIII supra), whichcontain a full discussion of all the important questions relating to arthapatti as a distinct prawdna and anCH, 11] INFURENOE 235

(a) Fallacious reasons (het 
vdbhasdh literally, semblances 
of reason)are of five kinds: 
viz., the reason that strays away
(savygbhicdrg), the adverse rea 
son (viruddha), the opposable 
reason (satpratipaksa), the un 
established reason (asiddha), and
the stultified reason (bddhita). 
(b) The straying" reason 
(savyabhicara)is otherwise 
known as anaikantika (literally^ 
not unfailing in its association 
with the probandum).It is of 
three kinds: viz., common (sa 
dharana), uncommon (asddha 
rand) and non-conclusive (anupa 
samharin ). 
The common strayer (sd 
dhardna) is that variety of stray 
ing reason which is present in a 
place where the frobandum
(s&dhya)is not present; ast in 
the argument "The mountain
has fire, because it is knowable"
In this argument "knowability is
236 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
found in a tank where fire is not 
present. The uncommon strayer 
(asadharana)is that reason 
which is present only in the sub 
ject (paksa) and not presentin 
any similar example (sapaksa) 
or counter-example (vipaksa) ; 
as sound-ness (sabdatva),in the 
argument ''Sound is eternal, 
because it is sound", sabdatzv
(sound-ness) being present only 
in sound, and nowhere else, eter 
nal or non-eternal. 
The non-conchisive strayer 
(anupasamharin) is that reason 
which has no affirmative or 
negative example (anvayadr 
st&ntaor vyatirekadrstanta) ; as 
knowableness (prameyatva)in 
the argument "All things are 
non-eternal, because they are 
knowable". Here, no example
is available since all things are 
treated as paksa. 
(c) The adverse reason 
(viruddha)is one which is in 
variably concomitant with the 
non-existence of the probandum;
as producibility (krtakatva),in 
the argument "Sound is eter-

nal, because it is produced".
Here producibilityis invariably 
concomitant with non-eternality, 
which amounts to the non-ex 
istence of eternality. 
(rf) The opposablc reason 
(satpratipaksa)is one which
admits of beingcounter-balanced 
by another reason that proves 
the non-existence of the pro 
bandum; as audibility in the 
argument "Sound is eternal, 
because it is audible, like sound 
ness (sabdatva*)'*. The counter 
reason in this case is produci 
bility (karyatva)in the counter 
argument "Sound is non-eter 
nal, because it is producible". 
(<?) The uneslablished rea 
son (asiddha)is of three kinds: 
viz., uncstablished in respect of 
abode (dsraydsiddha), unesta 
blished in respect of itself 
(svarapasiddha) and unesia 
blished in respect of its concom 
itance (vyapyatvasiddha}. 
The reason is dsraydsiddha 
in the argument "Sky- lotus is 
fragrant, because it is a lotus,
A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PA*TW  
like the lotus of a pond". Here,
sky-lotus is the abode or subject 
and it never exists. 
The reason is svarup&siddha
in the argument "Sound is a 
quality, because it is visible, like 
colour". Here, visibility cannot
be predicated of sound, which is 
only audible. 
The reason is said to be 
vydpyatvdsiddha when it is asso 
ciated with an adventitious con 
dition (upadhi). That is said to 
be an adventitious condition 
(upadhi), which is pervasive of
the probandum but not perva 
sive of the probans. 'To be 
pervasive of the probandum'
means 'never to be the counter 
correlative (pratiyogin) of 
non-existence (abhava) which
co-exists with the probandum'.
Not to be pervasive of the jpro 
bans* means 'being the counter 
correlative of non-existence 
which co-exists with the probans.9 
In the argument "The moun 
tain has smoke, because it has
fire", contact with wet fuel is 
the adventitious condition (upd*
dhi). "Where there is smoke,
INFERENCE 239   
there is contact with wet fuel" thus it is pervasive of the pro bandum. There is no contact with wet fuel in every place where there is fire; for instance, a red-hot iron ball has no contact with wet fuel; thus the upadhi is non-pervasive of the probans. In this manner, contact with wetfuel is the up&dhi in the present instance, because it is pervasive of the probandum but not perva sive of the probans. And firet in the argument under reference, is vyapyatv&siddha, since it is associated with an adventitious condition (upadhi). 
(/) The stultified reason (b&dhita)is one which is put forward to prove a p(robanduin
whose non-existence is establish, ed by another proof. "Fire is not hot, because it is a sub stance", the probandum is 'not being hot'; its reverse 'being hot' is perceived through tactile perception; so, the probans is stultified (badhita). 
Thus ends the chapter on
Inference.
240 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART mA hetv&bh&sa is a semblance of reason. It is afallacious reason or defective reason. It would not be quite correct to use the term fallacy as an equivalent of hetvtibhfisa. In western logic, the term fallacy is gene rally understood in the sense of 'a defective conclusion or interpretation/ resulting from a defective process ofthinking. The classification and elucidation of falla cies in western logic are generally influenced in a direct or indirect way by Aristotle's division of fallacies into those which are related to expression and those whichare not. Students of western logic are aware that the basis of the Aristotelian classification of fallacies can hardly be considered satisfactory either from the logi cal or from the rhetorical point of view. As early as in the age of Gautama, the Nyaya system of Indian thought equipped itself with a fairly satisfactory andwell-defined scheme of hetvabhdsa or defective probans. Gautama definitely classifies defective reasons underfive heads and uses the significant expression hetva bhasa, which suggeststhe futidanicntum divisionis of his classification. The expression hetvabhasa literally means 'a semblance of reason* or 'what appearsto be areason while it is really not such'. The true function of a hetu or probans is to prove. The defects whichvitiate a probans are called hetudosah. The commonfeature of such defects is that they vitiate the probative value of a probans. That this common feature viz.* vitiating the probative value of a prabans is the fundamental basis of Gautama's classification of defec   
tive reasons is implicitly conveyed by the significant name hetv&bhtisa used by Gautama. It may be noted
CH.II] INFERENCE 24t  
here that the same philosophic instinct, that helped the Nyaya theories of inference and syllogism over the for* malistic barriers which western logic still finds it diffi cult to surmount, has also made it possible for the Nyaya system to equip itself with a really helpful scheme of defective probans, hinging on the concept ofhetu which forms the main ground of syllogistic rea soning. The Naiyayikas who came after Gautama*more especially later Naiyayikas like GangeSa, effec tively used the hint afforded by Gautama's classification and clearly and definitely elucidated the principle underlying the Nyaya classification of hetv&bhds&s. The principle is taken for granted by writers like Annambhatta and is embodied in the definition of bet v&bh3sa in general. This definition may be set forth thus: A defective frobans (hetvfibh&sa or dusfahetu) is a reason whose 'probative value is vitiated by a circumstance, a valid knowledge of which would pre vent the inferential cognition (annmiti) kept in viewor the efficient cause of such cognition (anumitikarana), For instance, a vyabhicdrihetu, which is of the sadha rana type (common strayer), such as 'a jar' in the argument "The mountain has fire, because it has ajar", is a defective probans (dustahetu or hetvabhdsa) because its probative value is vitiated by the fact that it happens to be present in a place where fire is not present and a valid knowledge of this fact would pre vent the generalization (vy&ptijnana) "Whereverthere is jar, there is fire". This is a typical case wherethe efficient cause of inference (anumitikarana) is prevented. In an argument like this "Fire is not hofc, 16
142 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PAtx 10   
because it is a substance", the hetu is of the badhitatjrpt (stultified probans) ; in this case, the probative tfJdae fcf the probans is vitiated by the fact that it hap 9*113 to bie put forward to prove a thing which is already disproved by perceptual experience; that fire is not cold is a fact established by pratyaksa; and a valid know ledge of the fact that fire is never cold would directly prevent the inference that fire is cold. Thus, it will be seen that a valid knowledge of some vitiating ele ments (hetudosa), would directly prevent inferential cognition (anumiti) and a valid knowledge of someOthers like vyabhic&ra would prevent only the efficient cause of inference (anumitikarana) ,such as generali sation, in the form of knowledge of the invariable re tfetton between the probans and probandum. The Naiya yikas would insist that it is only a real defect, and not It fancied one, that should be taken to vitiate the pro bative value of a probans. Any erroneous notion that the connection between a valid probans, like smoke,fttid a probandumf like fire, is not invariable, should not be held to vitiate the probative value of the probans. 
Of the three varieties of the vitiating circumstancetailed vyabhic&ra (literally, straying away or incon stancy), the first, known as sQdharana, is the most im portant It generally proceeds from a careless orhasty generalization and when detected,it prevents ayalid knowledge of invariable connection (vyapti- }ff*a) 9 The uncommon stray er (asadh&rana) is con ceived of by the earlier Naiyayikas as a reason whichjus known not to co-exist with the probandum in any
CH.U} INFERENCE 143 sapaksa, where the probandum is recognized to be sent. In the illustration of &adharana given in the text, sabdatva (sound-ness) is present only in the^tfJtfa and nowhere else. According to the earlier Naiyayikas asadharanatva is anityadosa or operates as a defect only under certain circumstances. They draw a distinctioa between nityadofd (permanent defect)a defect* which, when rightly detected, always vitiates the fro bans, and anityadosa (occasional defect)a defect which, when rightly detected, vitiates the probans only under certain circumstances. They also hold that orfU dh&ranatva is an occasional defect (anityado^a) in the sense that a valid knowledge of its presence vitiates the reason only so long as there is a doubt regarding the presence of the probandum in the paksa. Forinstance, in the example given in the text, iabdatva   
(sound-ness) may be said to be not present in a sapaksa, only so long as there is some doubt regarding the presence of the probandum in the pak$a\ and if one should be sure of the presence of the probandum in the 
Pakfa and still desire to confirm one's knowledge by means of inference, the probans sabdatva cannot be said to be not presentin any place where the probandumis known for certain to be present, for the obvious reason that the probaus is present in the pak$at wherethe probandum is already known for certain to be pre sent. Annambhatta adopts the view of the earlier Naiyayikas in this matter. The later Naiyayikas define atadharana to be a probans which is not co-existent with its probandum (sadhy&sani&ntidhikaranah) ; and aknowledge of the no*- existence of the probans and the
244 A PK1MER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PAXT ra   
probandunt would prevent a knowledge of their invari able co-existence. The non-conclusive strayer (onupa~samhdrin) is defective reason which has neither an affirmative example (anvayadrstQnta) nor a negative example (vyatirekadrstQnta). This is the view of the earlier Naiyayikns and the illustration given by Annam bhatta in his text is based on this view. In this illus tration, all things come under paksa\ when there is doubt regarding the probandum everywhere, there can be no certainty concerning the co-existence of the pro bans and the probandum, anywhere; thus one cannot have a conclusive knowledge of vyftptim such cases; and this is how, in such cases, the probative value ofthe probans comes to be vitiated. The later Naiyayikasdo not accept this view. They contend that, even when 'o/r are pakfas, those particular cases in whichone may be sure of the co-existence of the probans andthe probandunt, may well be treated as drstanta; andso, a toon-conclusive strayer (anupasamharin) should bedefined to be a defective probans, whose 'probandunt happens to be omni-present (kevalGnvayin). The viti ating circumstance in this case is, according to the later Naiyayikas, that a knowledge of the negative concomit ance (vycttirekary^pii)is prevented; and, in spite ofthis defect, inferential cognition (anumiti) may arise from a knowledge of positive concomitance alone 
(anvayav^pti). 
The adverse probans (viruddha) and the oppos able probans (satpratipaksa) should be carefully distinguished. In the case of viruddha, the sameCH. n] INFERENCE   
probans proves the contrary, the probandum being known to be invariably concomitant with the absence of the probans. In the case of satpratipaksa, the probansadmits of being counter-balanced by an opposite pro bans, which may be put forward to prove the contrary. The vitiating circumstance in a viruddha is that it prevents inference (anumiti). In the case of a sahprali paksa, the two counter-balancing reasons prevent each other from producing the inference connected with it. Some Naiyayikas hold that, in cases of satpratipaksa, a dubitative type of inferential cognition (samSaya rupGnuwHi) arises. It will be seen that viruddhaiva is a more serious defect than satpratipafaatva, for the obvious reason that the former involves a greater degree of carelessness in reasoning. 
The unestablished reason (asiddha)is defective in that a knowledge of the fact that the probansis unestablished prevents a knowledge of the presence of the invariably concomitant probans in the Paksa (i.e., prevents paramaria) in the first twovarieties viz., Gfraydsiddha and svarup&siddha; while, in the third variety v\z. % vy&pyatvasiddha, it is defec tive in that a knowledge of the relation of invariable concomitance (vydptijiidna)is prevented. In con nection with the elucidation of the nature of uptidhi, which is associated with the third kind of asiddha, Annambhatta speaks of four kinds of adventitious cir cumstance (upadhi)in his Dlpikd. These four varieties are: (1) an adventitious circumstance with which, the ptobandum, taken by itself, is concomitant (kevala s&dhyavyapakah) ; (2) one with which, the probvndum,
246 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
as determined by an attribute of paksa, is concomitant(pakfadharm&vacchinnas&dhyavy&pakah) ; (3) <mewith which, the probandum, as determined by the p*o bvns, is concomitant (sadhanavacchinnasOdhyavyG P&kah) ; and (4) one with which, the probandumis concomitant, as determined by an attribute not belong ing to the paksa, nor being the protans (udfisiHQ dharmfivacchinnasadhyavyaipakah). The instance cited in the text, vis., con tact with wet fuel (firdrendhanasam yoga) is typical of the first variety of upddhi. In the argument "Air is perceptible; because it has touch which is perceptible" 'perceptible colour' (udbh&ta rftpa) is upadhi of the second variety; ior, with this upadhi, the probandum perceptibility is invariably concomitant, as determined by the attribute being anexternal substance (bahirdravyatva) which belongs to the pakfa. In the argument"Antecedent negation is destructible; because it is producible", bhQvatiw(ens-ness) is upadhi of the third variety; for, with this up&dhi, the probandum-~destruclibilit) is con comitant, as determined bythe probans producibility. In the argument "Antecedent negation is destructible; because it is knowable", bhavatta is upadhi of the fourth variety; for, with this upadhi, the Probandum is concomitant as determined by producibility, which is neither the pro bans nor any other attribute of the pak$a. In all these four varieties, it will be seen that the probans may be present in a place where the upadhimay not be present (i.e., upadhivyabhicarin) ; that the s&dhya (probandum) 9 in one of its fourformsdepcribcd above, U invariably associated with the upadhi, which
QH. u] INFERENCE 24*  
is thus sadhyavyfyaka] and that the probans, whichstrays away from the sphere of sddhyavydpata, mustnecessarily stray away from the sphere oisddhya itself. A thing* whose extent is represented by a circle, whichhas a portion falling outside the sphere of a secondthing represented by a second circle, must necessarily have a portion falling outside the sphere of a third thing represented by a third circle contained within thesecond circle representing the sphere of the second thing. This relation is embodied in the generalization: "Whichever strays away from thejervadcr, must strajr away from the pervaded" (yo yadvydpakavyabhicarQsa tadvyabhicdrl). On the basis of this generalization, every case of upddhi leads to the inference of vyabhicfirv and through such inference, prevents a knowledge ofvyapti. Some Naiyayikas hold that the vitiatingcir cumstance in upddhi is that the negation of the parti cular upddhi admits of being put forward as a counter balancing probans to prove the contrary and that it leads thus to the inference of satpratipaksatva. Thesetwo vjiews are usually expressed thus in Sanskrit :-~ "Upddhih vyabhicdronndyakah" ; "Upddhih saiprali* paksonndyakah". 
The defect called bddha consists in the negation ofthe probandum being already established by a stronger proof, This defect directly prevents inference (a*lf*? miti). It is sometimes suggested that it is unnecessary to recognize bddha as a distinct defect of the probamjfor, it may be merged in vyabhicdra in cases where probans is known to be present in pakfa which is
248 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART nr   
to be devoid of the probandum ; and it may be mergedin asiddhi in cases where the paksa is known to be devoid of the probans. It should, however, be remem bered that the suggested merger is not possiblein certain arguments like this. "A jarat the first moment of its creation has smell; because it is earth" (ntpattiksane ghatah gandhavan, prthivltvat); and that, in such cases, the only defect that may be pointed out is badha. 
The Vaisesikas recognize only three hctvdbhasas viz., viruddha (the adverse probans), asiddha (the uncstablished probans) and samdigdha (the doubtful probans}. The last corresponds to what the Naiyayi kas call vyabhicara. The satpratipaksatva of the NySyasystem may he brought under viruddha, according to the Vaisesikas, and the badha, partly under samdigdhaand partly under asiddha. 
It is necessary to differentiate the defective varie ties of the probans (hctvabhasah)described above, from what are known in Gautama's Nyaya as chala, j&ti and nigrahasthana. Chala is dialectic quibbling mainly through equivocation. J&ti is a futile respon dence through parity or disparity. Gautama shows at the end of the first ahnika of the fifth chapter of Nydya s&tras, how a debate, carried on exclusively throughj&ti, is bound to become a barren type of dialectic tu quoque, leading to nothing. Nigrahasth&na is a vulne rable point which makes for defeat in a debate and neednot necessarily invalidate an argument. When a person is described as navakambala in the sense that he has anew blanket, it would be chala to object to the state-
CH.II] INFERENCE 249  
ment by perversely misinterpreting it to mean 'having nine blankets'. It should be noted here that the expres sion navakambala is ambiguous and may mean 'having a new blanket* or 'having nine blankets/ To the argu ment "Sound is non-eternal, because it is produced, like a jar'*, it would be a futile respondence (j&tyut tara) to say "Sound may well be said to be eternal, because it has no activity (niskriya),like ether". To shift one's ground without adequate reason and give up the thesis proposed to be maintained (pratifnahani andfratijfiasariinyctsa), to be unable to give a suitable reply when a reply is called for (apratibha) weak points like these are vulnerable points (nigrahasthana) whichmake for defeat in a debate. All the defective varie 
ties of probans (hctvabhasah) may also be treated as> vulnerable points, while the latter, other than defective reasons, do not invalidate an argument.
CHAPTER III   
ASSIMILATION OR ANALOGY (uipamana) 37 T 
Assimilation (upamana) is 
the instrument of assimilative 
cognition. Assimilative cogni 
tion (upamiti) consists in the 
knowledge of the relation bet 
ween a name and the object de 
noted by it. Knowledge of simi 
larity is the efficient instrument
(karana} of such cognition. 
This may be illustrated thus : 
A person happens to be ignorant
of the exact meaning of the 
word gavaya (a particularani 
mal of the bovine species). From
a forester, he learns that a
gavaya is similar to a coze;; he
goes to a forest, sees the animal
called gavaya, which is similar 
to a cow and recollects the in 
formation conveyed bythe as 
similative proposition (atidefa 
vakya). Then the assimilative 
cognition, "This is the animal
(of the bovine species) denoted
by the word gavaya'9 arises. 
Thus ends the chapter on
upamana.
CH. m] ASSIMILATION OR ANALOGY 251   
The NyJya conception of upam&na as a distinct instrument of valid cognition restricts its scope to as certainment of the primary denotative or significative power of a word (saktigraha). The chief object ofthe Naiyayikas in so restrictingits scopeis to save it from being swallowed up in inference (anumana).It should be carefully noted here that, according to the MImamsakas, the cognition embodied in the proposition "The animal called gavaya is similar to a cow" is the efficient instrument (karaya) and the cognition<4 Mycow is similar to this animal called gavaya'9is the resultant upamiti (assimilative cognition); whereas,according to the KTaiyayikas the resultant upamiti is in the form of the knowledge of the primary significative power of the word gavaya (gavayapadasaktigraha).It could be easily seen that the relation between the karana (efficient instrument) and the phala (result), according to the MImamsakas, is exactly similar to the relation between the two propositions "A is similar to B" and "B is similar to A". The Vaisesikas andBauddhas could easily show how the latter, viz. 9 "B is similar to A" may be taken to be inferred from the former, viz., "A is similar to B". The Naiyayikascleverly escape from this danger by narrowing the scope of upamana as indicated above. One might,however, remark that the Nyaya conception of upam&nais singuhrly unpractical and unfruitful. V&tsy&y ana'fremarks on upamtina, under l-i-6 and II-i-44 to 48, throw some light on the practical value of this pramana.
,252 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART ra   
The BJt&fyak&ra points out bow it would be of great practical value to know exactly what is denoted by cer tain technical names of medicinal herbs, as used in the Ayurveda literature. It should be remembered here that the Indian view of a pram&na is that it is an effi cient instrument of valid knowledge, which possesses such unchallenged certitude as is usually associated with validity or as is not nullified by subsequent experience; or according to some Indian thinkers, it is an efficient instrument of valid knowledge, which possesses such practical utility and effectiveness as is usually associa ted with validity. In this way, it would not be difficult to appreciate the reasons why the Nai>ayikas regard upamfina as a distinct pram&na.
CHAPTER IV   
VALID VERBAL TESTIMONY. Sentence orproposition (sabdha) 
38 T 
(a)Valid verbal testimony 
is a propositionset forth by a
trustworthy person (&pta). One
who habitually speaks only truth 
is a trustworthy person (#/>/a) r 
A sentence or proposition is a
group of words like "Bring acow" (gdntdttaya). 
(b) A word is that which
has significative potency (Sakti). 
"From th'.s word, this concept 
should be known" God's will 
to this effect (Uvarasamketah)
is cabled fakti (significative po-. 
tency). 
The VaiSesikas would bring valid verbal testimony also under inference. The Naiyayikas however, con tend that, in cases where valid knowledge is derived from valid verbal testimony (<pram&nafabda) ,one is not conscious of any conclusion through subsumption to a generalization ; but one is, on the contrary, con scious of a valid verbal cognition or judgment (tebda bodha) resulting from a knowledge of words, without the mediacy of any such subsumptive process of
254 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PAtT in   
thought. For this reason, the Nyaya system holds that Jabda deserves the rank of a distinct pram&na. 
The recognition of fabda as a distinct firam&nahzs laid most of the Indian systems of philosophy open to the charge of dogmatism. Careful students of Indian philosophy know well that this charge, when put for ward in a sweeping form, can easily be exposed as 
on certain misapprehensions. Certain objections be raised by advocates of independent thinking agaitist the vfcw of the Mlm&rtisakas that the relation between a word and its meaning is eternal and that the 
statements constituting the Vedas should be held to be eternal and eternally valid and to possess self-evident validity. But these objections cannot be raised 
against the Ny&ya view of sabdapramana. This view seeks to reconcile the Nyaya stand point of ra/!0na/u*n with the conception of fabda as a distinct source of valid knowledge, through the Nyaya theory 
of extrinsic validity (paratahpr&manya). According to the Naiyfiyikas, it should be remembered that a fabdais a source of valid knowledge only in so far as the source of sabda is a perfectly trustworthy person andthat validity (framdtva)of the knowledge derived froma Sabda is extrinsically caused (paratah utpadyate) through the reliability of the speaker and is also ex trinsically made out (faratah jnayate) through verifi cation in direct experience. The Naiyayikas seek to gain a twofold advantage by this view of tabda* Oneadvantage consists in the fact that they have succeeded in freeing their rationalistic system of thought from theOff. iv} VERBAL TESTIMONY 2*5   
reproach of dogmatism ; and the other advantage con sists in the fact that they are able to base a theistic argument on this view by pointing out that belief in the infallibility of the Veda would necessarily imply a belief in the Veda having been produced by an infallible author such an infallible author in the case of Vedabeing none other than the Omnipotent and Omniscient God. 
The primary significative potency of a word, called padasakti, is the eternal significative relation between a word and its sense, according to the Mimamsakas; and it should be brought under fakti, which is a distinct category or quality according to them. The Naiyayikas refuse to accept this view and hold that the utmost that could be said about padasakti is that it is the will of God to the effect that a particular word should convey a particular sen&e. This is on the assumption that speech is not a human productbut made by God for the benefit of humanity. 
39 T 
(a) Vebal expectancy, con 
gruity and proximity these are 
the causes which bring about 
verbal cognition or judgmentfrom a proposition, 
(t) Verbal expectaacfc
(ak&nk$a) consists in a word not
being capable %f conveying a
complete judgmentin the absence 
of another word.
256 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PA*T m  
(c) Congruity (yogyaid) 
consists in the sense being not 
stultifiable. 
(d) Proximity (sannidhi) 
consists in the articulation of
words without undue delay. 
(e) A sentence which is 
devoid of expectancy and the 
other two requirements (con 
gruitytnd proximity) does not 
bring about a valid cognition. 
For instance, a string of words
like "Cow, horse, man, elephant" 
does not produce any judgment ; 
for there is no verbal expectancy 
(&k&nks&) here. The sentence 
"One should sprinkle with fire" 
does not produce a valid judg 
ment, as there is no congruity 
here. Words like "Bring a
cow", uttered at long intervals, 
cannot produce a valid judg 
ment, owing to want of proxi 
mity. 
In section 39, Annambhatta briefly states the Nyaya view regardingthe accessories necessary for arriving at a valid judgment from a proposition. In every language, ftrtain words necessarily require certain 
other words to complete the sense. For instance, a verb denoting an action necessarily requires a kQraka
OH* tv] VERBAL TESTIMONY 257   
such as a word denoting the agent or instrumtnt orobject of the action ; and in the absence of such a word*it cannot convey a complete sense. This kind ofsyntactic need is what is called verbal expectancy orakfink?&. Words which are not requiredfor syntactic completeness or which have no kind of syntacticrela tion whatever cannot form a proposition. YoyyatA or congruity of the sense is stated to be another require ment. One can easily see that, in the example given in the text, the concept of fireis incongruous as a meansof sprinkling; because sprinkling is done with water* and not with fire. When the words constituting asentence are uttered at long intervals, one cannot haveany connected thought and complete judgment in the form of verbal cognition does not arise. With regardto the causal connection between yogyata and s&bdor bodha, there is difference of opinion among the Naiylryikas. Many Naiyayikas hold that a decisive know*ledge of congruity (yogyattiniscaya)i a pre-requisite of verbal cognition. Some of them maintain that adecisive knowledge of incongruity (ayogyatanticaya) prevents verbal cognition (Sabdabodhafratitwd/taka)and the absence of sijch a counteracting 0gent is neces sary lot having the effect. 
In this connection, attention may be drawn to the relation between a decisive knowledge of the speaker's intention (tatparyanifcayo) and the verbal cognition (fabdabodha) arising from a sentence. Some hoGt
that tatfarywUcaya is an accessory cause of sdbda bodhai others hold that it is required only io cases where ambiguous words or expressions are used ; and'7 *
258 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PART m  
yet others maintain that, though it is required, it neednot be referred to separately as a cause of i&bdabodha*for the reason that dkankjfl (syntactic expectancy) consists in the need which one word has for another word in order to convey the complete sense intended to be conveyed and that, in this form, akankffi includes tatparya. 
Students of Nyaya will do well to note the essen tial features of the NySya theory of sdbdabodha.This theory is, for all practical purposes, the Nyayatheory of the importof propositions. The Nyaya viewis that only a determinate judgment (savikalpakajfidna) is embodied in, and conveyed by, a proposition; every proposition comprises at least a subject (uddefya) andpredicate (vidheya) ; in a verbal judgment (s&bda V.odha) arising in the hearer's mind from a proposition, the meaning of the chief substantive in the nominative case (pratham&totartha) playsthe role of the leading concept (mukhyavie?ya)and all the other concepts are directly or indirectly subordinated to it ; the cogni tion arising from a propositionis always non-percep tual (parokfa) ; and the additional element conveyedby a sentence, over and above the separate concepts conveyed by separate words, is the intended relation ofthe concepts (padfirthasarnsarga) and this additional element, which is the distinctive feature of a verbal judgment (v&ky&rtha),is conveyed through the parti cular juxtaposition of words (samMrgamarytdd)^ andnot through a primaryor secondary significative power of words (abhidhdor lakfana). It may be1observed here that the juxtapositioa
OH. iv] VEDBAL TESTIMONY 259  
yad&), referred to here, turns out to be identical with co-utterance (samabhivydhtra), which i$ reducible to the form of what is technically known as syntactic expectancy (&kdnk$a). 
It may be useful here to contrast the Nyaya theory of iabdabodha with the sdbdabodha theories of certain other Indian schools. According to the Vaiy&karanas,the activity denoted by the root of the finite verb 
(dhatvartha) is the leading concept in a verbal cogni*tion arising from a sentence ; and according to the BhaJtas, the wf to do9(fyti) denoted by the endingof the finite verb is the leading concept there. If, fromthe stand-point of logical analysis, the subject is the central concept of a judgment, the meaning of the root of the finite verb may be regarded as its central concept from the stand-point of linguistic analysis; or the "will to do\ denoted by the ending of the finite verb, may J>e viewed as its central concept from the stand-point ofMimariisa legalism. 
The Nyaya system recognizes only two main types of significative force (fabdavrtti) viz., abhidhd (the primary significative force) and lak$an& (the secondarysignificative force). It refuses to accept the third type of significative force called vyanjana or suggestion, which is recognized by the Alamkarikas as a distinct type of sabdavrtti, and bringsit under inference. According to the Nyaya system, the primary significa tive force (abhidhd) includes two phases, which corres pond to connotation and denotation, and relate to j&ti (generality) as the connoted attribute, and to vyakti(the individual thing) as the denoted object qualified
260 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC   
by such attribute. In other words, the Naiyayikas generally maintain that the primary sense of & word is ordinarily an individual qualified by a generic attribute 
(jWtvUiftovyakti). Students of modern philosophy will find it easy to see that, according to the Nyayasystem, the concepts conveyed by separate words are apparent simples* but really petrified judgments. AHthe names, including proper names, are connotative, according to Nyaya.40-T 
(a) There are two classes 
of sentences : those that belong 
to the Veda and those that 
belong to secular speech. Those
that belong to the Veda are all 
statements of God and therefore 
authoritative. Of those that 
belong to secular speech, such as 
produced by trustworthy persons 
are authoritative and others are 
not authoritative. 
(6) Verbal cognition (Mb*
dajnfaa) is the knowledge of 
the meaning of a sentence. Its 
efficient instrument (fearana) 
is sentence (iabda). 
Here ends the chapter on
Verbal Testimony. 
Thus valid experience 
(yathtrthfaubhwa) has been
explained,
<?H. iv} ERROR 36! 41 T   
(a) Erroneous experience 
is of three kinds the three 
varieties being doubt, misappre 
hension and indirect argument
(reductio ad alsurdum). 
(b) A doubt is a cognition 
which relates to several incom 
patible attributes in the same
thing as, in the dubitative cog 
nition "It may be a post or a
man". 
(c) Misapprehension is a
false cognitionas in the erro 
neous cognition of a nacre, in 
the form ''This is silver". 
(d)Indirect argument (re 
ductio ad absurdum) consists in 
the hypothetical admission of
vyapya (an invariably concomi 
tant fact) which leads to the 
admission of the pervasive con 
comitant (vytifiaka) ; as, "If
there were no fire, there would
be no smoke''. 
42T 
Recollection is also of two
kitfds: true and false. The
former is the result of a valid 
experience; and the latter arises 
from an erroneous experience.

In this connection students may be advised to readagain pages 104 to 146 of chapter I part III. 43 T 
(a)Pleasure is a quality 
which all consider agreeable. 
(6) Pain is a quality which
all consider disagreeable. 
(c) Desire is wish. 
(d)Dislike is ill-feeling. 
(e)Volitional effort is the 
will to do. 
(/) Dharma is the unseen
spiritual benefit accruing from
the performance of actions 
which are enjoined by the Vedic
law. 
(g) Adharma is the unseen 
spiritual demerit accruing from
the performance of forbidden 
actions. 
(h) Cognition and the 
following seven qualities (eight 
in all) are the specific qualities 
(vihsagun&h) found only in the 
soul. Cognition, desire and
volitional effort may be eternal 
or non-eternal; they are eternal 
in God and non-eternal in the 
ordinary souls of living beings
CH. iv] QUALITIES 26S  
(i) There are three kinds
of tendencies or impressions 
speed, reminiscent impression 
and elasticity. Speed belongs
to the substances earth, water, 
fire, air and mind. Reminiscent
impression belongs only to the 
soul and it results from a previ 
ous experience and causes recol 
lection. Elasticityis the ten 
dency of a thing to recover its 
original form when it is changed.
Here ends the section dealing 
with Qualities. 
It would be useful if students read again,in this connection, pages 13 to 15 of chapter I part III. 44 T 
Activity is of the nature of
motion* Upward motion leads 
to contact with an upper place. 
Downward motion leads to con 
tact with a lower place* Con 
traction leads to contact with a
place near one's body. Expan 
sion leads to contact with a place 
remdte from one's body. All 
the other varieties of motion
come under 'going*.
264 A PRIMER OF INDIAN LOGIC [PAHTJB45 T   
Generality is a generic attri 
bute which is eternal and one
and inheres in many things.It 
is found in substances, qualities 
and activities. Existence (sattS) 
15 the most comprehensive type 
of generality. Substance-ness
and such others are less compre 
hensive. 
46 T 
Specialities are the differen 
tiating features belonging to 
eternal substances. 
47 T 
Inherence is the eternal 
relation, which belongsto the 
inseparables. An inseparable 
pair consists of two things of 
which one thing, so long as it 
does not come to an end, exists 
only in the other thing: as 
component part and the compo 
site whole, quality and subst 
ance, motion and moving body, 
generality and the individual 
having it, and speciality and the 
ternal substance having it. 
In this connection, students will do well to read again pages 18 to 37 pi chapter I, part III.CM, iV] NON-EXISTENCB 48 T   
(a) Antecedent non-exis 
tence has no beginning but has 
an end. It relates to the period 
preceding the production of art 
effect. 
(b) Annihilative non-exis 
tence has a beginning but has no
end. It relates to the period 
subsequent to the production of 
an effect. 
(c) Total non-existence is 
the negation of a counter-corre 
lative in respect of relation to 
all the three times present, 
past and future as in the 
statement* -"There Is no jar on
this spot" 
(rf) Reciprocal non-exist 
ence is the negation of a counter 
correlative in respect of its 
identity with another thing 
as in the statement "A jar is 
not a cloth". 
Here, students should peruse again pages 37 to 52of chapter I, part III.49 T
