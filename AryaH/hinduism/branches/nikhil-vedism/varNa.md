Let us reject the framing of Vedism vs. orthodox Hinduism as a struggle between Rājanía and Brāhmaṇá religions, and remember instead that the Brahmá–Kṣatrá are Vedically united (TB 3.8.4.3, ĀiB 3.11.8) in ruling the Víş (KB 16.5.6, ŞB 11.2.7.16), with the Brahmán subordinate to the Kṣatrá in the realm of politics (TS 2.5.10.1, ĀiB 7.29.2) and yet, in the realm of ritual and of religious authority, the Kṣatrá subordinate to the Brahmán (PB 2.8.2, ĀiB 8.9.6).

Vis - Its basic meaning is "family" or "household" (cognate to the œco- in œconomics), so it can also be synonymous with the normal Ā́rya citizenry (Vāíşya-s, a word that comes from Víş) who weren't nobility or priests.
