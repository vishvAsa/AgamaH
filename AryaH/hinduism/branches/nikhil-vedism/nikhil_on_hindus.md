## Invitation

Never lose heart, Vedists.

The orthodox and modern Hindus, trapped in their false and impious ways, will always vastly outnumber us, just as even Dásyu-s have always far outnumbered the Ā́rya-s. There is nothing inherently wrong with that, nor surprising.…

Like ants obeying an adulterous queen, they are only capable of mindlessly citing their prædecessors and refuse to give thought to concepts like Beauty, Truth, or logical consistency. In fact, they view religion as a tool for social control rather than as actual Truth.

So they never bother to ask themselves basic questions about their religion. 

- "How does it make sense for Índra to be a title whose occupant keeps changing when the Véda mentions nothing about it? Doesn't this sound like a made-up excuse for inconsistencies in later scriptures?"
- "What kind of religion makes up stories about the king of the Gods being humiliated and covered in one thousand female genitalia?" 
- "What kind of religion says that bathing in a river or fasting for a day can erase all your sin?"
- "Would the Vedic Pitŕ̥-s, whose scriptures mention no such things and praise Índra to the utmost, have considered themselves part of the same religion as people who believe that Índra is covered in one thousand female genitalia? Or would they have slain you as blasphemers?"
- "Why would a religion of a martial, pastoral folk, with frequent scriptural references to hunting and meat-eating, promote vegetarianism? Why would a religion of Fathers who subjugated and enslaved their enemies promote feminism and equality?"
- "What does it say about accepting the evolution of Hinduism if it resulted in the Kāma-sūtrá?" "and in phallus-worship?" "and in Khajuraho?" "and in tantric orgies?" "and in Gandhi?" "What kind of religion has trads who can't even agree that abortion is evil?"
- "Why would Índra share the delights of Svargá with people who don't worship Him, who mock Him and laugh at Him for supposedly being subordinate to Víṣṇu? Isn't it far more likely that He would send these orthodox Hindus straight to Náraka?"

Hindus did not answer these questions. Instead, they attempted to reconcile their heresies and degeneracies with the Véda by largely treating it as a sacred sound rather than a real text with specific meanings and teachings and injunctions.

But this situation is finally starting to change as more Hindus are starting to read the actual Véda for themselves, and the extent to which they have been deceived by the trads and the modernists is beginning to dawn upon them. "What does Sai Baba have to do with the Véda?"

This is how I myself arrived at Vedism—first by reading the Véda, by falling in love with it and realizing the unrivaled Beauty and Truth in the Ŕ̥ṣi-s' poëtry—and then by realizing how profoundly it contradicted all I'd ever been taught about Hinduism.

Vedism was a faith of simple and honest folk who had spirit in them, who sacrificed meat and composed neat poëtry in an elegant tongue to honor the Gods. They took pleasure in life rather than seeking to escape from it. They feared the Gods and obeyed Them honestly and simply.

They lived a natural life and adhered to natural morality. They rode horses and hunted, they raced chariots, they delighted in Fire and the Dawn and the Sun, they made love to their beautiful women, and they mercilessly slew anyone who threatened the existence of their order.

Orthodox Hinduism is a "faith" of expert mental gymnasts who freely indulge all manner of incoherent hyperbole, blasphemy, innovation, and self-aggrandizement under the guise of following the Véda. They have no hesitation in lies because they don't really believe in Divine Law. The "culture" of orthodox Hindus is best repræsented not by sóma-strengthened warriors riding to battle under King Índra's gaze but by feeble ascetics starving themselves under trees, repetitively chanting prayers so that they can achieve "mókṣa".+++(4)+++

Slowly but surely, more and more people are realizing what should be plainly visible to all, shrouded by the black lies of the main-stream Hindus. If you really love Beauty and Truth—if you really love your Fathers—if you really love the Gods—I invite you to revert to Vedism!

For the sacrificer's fate is Heaven, a world of rivers of delightful wine and beautiful maidens and lakes of butter and shores of honey. And the alternative, O Ā́rya-s!—the fate of those who continue to revile Índra—is the black abyss of Hell.

Friends like @X_XIX_VIII will help his fellow Kṣatríya-s slowly realize the necessity of returning to the Vedic religion, a religion in which Kṣatríya-s are venerated as great kings and not subjected to humiliation with made-up stories about being eradicated by "Paraşurāmá". 

I believe he will be more successful with Kṣatríya-s than I will be at converting Brāhmaṇá-s. For many Kṣatríya-s still have testosterone and a fighting spirit in them and understand on an instinctual level why modern Hinduism is so depraved, whereas Brāhmaṇá-s have largely become pathetic pacifists who shudder at the thought of killing a fly and will justify it with a thousand verses of made-up scripture about how all fly-killers are destined to spend one crore years in Hell. But there will be some Brāhmaṇá-s too who revert, who still have some manhood left in them and abhor as tragedy the corruption of our Fathers' sacred learning.

Ultimately, as more and more young Hindus of all three castes seek answers, seek a religion that actually makes sense and isn't riddled with nonsensical contradictions, seek a morality that isn't arbitrary Brahmanical seething but truly based in nature and intuition, Vedism will continue to grow. There will come a time when thousands of Ā́rya-s once again sacrifice ghee into the fire at Dawn, revering the Fathers and the True Gods Who gave us everything and to Whom we owe everything.


## Frustration
I have never seen any religion of people as totally and profoundly unconcerned with the Truth as Hindus, orthodox or modern.  Even literal Muslims are more honest than the average Hindu. My hatred for them swells day by day. Lying is part of the moral code of the modern Hindu; they have no shame or innate feeling of guilt in uttering untruth.

Fundamentally, over the past two years I have realized that Hindus as a body are not my "brothers in religion" or "co-religionists".  Hinduism is not a religion but a group of disparate, wildly contradictory religions; and I have less in common with certain types of modern Hindus than I do with Muslims. If there were ever any objections to Vedism that were actually true, I would not convert to another type of Hinduism but I would become some sort of religionless person.

### Anti-trad
Trad Hindus of course must oppose what I'm doing, because Vedism would repræsent an existential threat to their authority if it became more widely practiced.  If Hindus began respecting the value of Truth, they would realize that there's literally no reason to follow any of the contradictory post-Vedic traditions, and that they have been (characteristically) lied to by power-hungry Hindus like that guy for millennia, and the Hindu synthesis would break down.  This is why his kind react so aggressively to Vedism, and call us "adulteresses" and "incels". Whether or not we acknowledge it or like it, trad ideology is an existential enemy of Vedism.

The only problem is that non-Vedists benefit from my work, too.  I don't want to help orthodox Hindus, since they regard me as their enemy and a "crackpot conspiracy theorist".

You should remember that, despite the mutual animosity, you share some common interests with trad and moderns; and furthermore you owe the "trad" ones a debt of gratitude for preserving the scripture you're obsessed about. Gratitude being a vedist good, it would not be out of place to return some favors; not to mention making common cause against "moderns" and mlechCha-s.  (Roughly same dynamic as AryasamAj)

Also BTW, some traditional minded people do admire your work and wish it well (considering the alternatives).
