## Prostitution
Prostitutes existed in Vedic times and were even employed in certain rituals.  So while (obviously) it should be discouraged and (far from Vedic society being "sex work–positive") they were looked down upon as impure, there was a recognition that promiscuous women who sell their bodies are a fundamental part of any society (even the most supposedly degeneracy-free like Islamic ones), and the recognition of this rôle extended to the religious sphere.
