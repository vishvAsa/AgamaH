pUrvamImAMsaka-s who ignore jNAna-kANDa of vedas and non-vedic texts.

- Refs: [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mim%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81). \[[AL06](http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2006-January/015679.html), [Idx](http://www.mimamsa.org/articles/brief_introduction.html)\]

### Likes:
- their regard for the "eternal" veda-s fits in nicely with viewing them as dharma-manuals for human beings to abide by Rta (the divine order). they reconcile respectability of the smRti-s as being derived from lost veda-s.
- their arthavAda concept, which reduces the tales the ("eternal") veda-s spin (and unrealistic injunctions) to praises or condemnation of dhArmika action. This is important and more widely applicable.
- they appeal to unconscious apurva-s (rather than Ishvara) to deliver fruits of dhArmika actions (esp. yajJNa). since it does not need a creator God.

### Dislikes
- Text centrism
