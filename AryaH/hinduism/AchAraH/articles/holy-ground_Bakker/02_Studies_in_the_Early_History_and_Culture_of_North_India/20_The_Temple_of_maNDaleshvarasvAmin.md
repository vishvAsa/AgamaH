The Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription of the Time of Udayasena Reconsidered

Introduction

The hill near the village Ramgarh, on whose top \(height 184 m\) the so-called

‘Muṇḍeśvarī Temple’ is found,1 belongs to the northern spurs of the Kaimur Range, the eastern embranchment of the Vindhyas. It is situated in the Kaimur District of southwest Bihar, 70 km SE of Vārāṇasī, 170 km SW of Patna, 60 km

NW of Rohtasgarh on the River Son, and 8 km SW of Bhabua, as the crow flies. 

The present octogonal temple has attracted the attention of scholars since the early days of Francis Buchanan, whose description had been used by Montgomery Martin in his Eastern India, which appeared in 1838. Buchanan reports that his description is based on the drawings of a painter whom he had sent up to the place, which might have taken place in January 1813. 2 A print based on this was included in Martin’s Eastern India \(Plate 78\). Earlier a drawing of the temple had been made by Thomas Daniell \(Plate 79\), who probably visited the site in February 1790, 3 and whose engraving, published in 1808, might have been known to Buchanaṇ 4 As can be derived from both pictures, the temple was largely covered by a mound of rubble overgrown with plants and trees. The site was excavated by the Archaeological Survey of India \(ASI\) after a visit of Theodor Bloch in 1902. 5 Bloch was also the first to report on the inscription that is the subject of this paper̥ He notes the following \( op. ciṭ 

43\):

\[. . . \] Among the débris  the second half of an inscribed stone has been found, the first half of which had been sent to the Indian Museum Calcutta in 1891. 

∗ The first version of this article was published in Indo-Iranian Journal 56.3–4 \(2013\), 263–77. This double issue of IIJ contained the articles based on papers given at the symposium Epigraphical Evidence for the Formation and Rise of Early Śaivism, which was held at the University of Groningen, 4–5 June 2012. 

1 The temple and hill are named after the goddess who today is the central focus of worship \(see Jayasal 2017, 117 Fig. 340\).

This stone is dated year 30, the 22nd of Kārttika, which must be referred to the

Harṣa Era, thus corresponding with 635 A.d.

The two halves of the stone have been combined and were first edited and published by r̥d. Banerji in Epigraphia Indica IX \(1907–08\). 

This Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription of the Time of Udayasena, Year 30 has gone through altogether five editions \(r̥d. Banerji 1907–08, ṇG. Majumdar 1920, P.K. Agrawala 1987, P.r̥ Srinivasan 1991, J. Neuss 2003\), but in spite of the work done by these excellent epigraphists, I think there is still room for improvemenṭ 8

The temple on Muṇḍeśvarī Hill

Before discussing the inscription in more detail, however, a few words should be said about the temple. Joanna Williams gives the following assessmenṭ 

Fragments at the site extend from the sixth century until the eighth or later̥ On stylistic grounds the surviving octagonal shrine should belong to the first half of the seventh century. \[. . . \] 9

The hill, temple, surrounding débris, and the inscription have been thoroughly examined by Jürgen Neuss \(2003\). 12 Neuss subscribes to the almost universally accepted theory that dates the oldest elements of the architecture of the present refers to the Harṣa Era, yielding a date of A.d. 636, the temple stylistically can be assigned to the same perioḍ’

12 More recently another inventory of the remains on the hill was made by Fiona Buckee \(2008\). 

She generously shared her photo documentation with me. 

In 2018 Buckee

presented a paper The Curious Case of the Octagonal Temple: A Revised History of the Temples of Mundeshvari Hill in the 24th Conference of the EASAA in Naples, 2–6

July 2018. I refer to this as Buckee forthcoming. Again another extensive survey of the archaeological remains of the hill, in situ  and in museums, was made by Meera Sharma 2017. It is included in Jayaswal et al.  2017. This latest inventory is not incorporated in the present essay. Finally an extensive treatment of the historic evidence regarding Muṇḍeśvarī Hill is found in Bakker 2014, 221–39.

temple to the first half of the seventh century. 13 However, Neuss rejects one piece of evidence used to endorse this theory, viz. the alleged contemporaneity of the temple and the inscriptioṇ 14

The date of the Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription

Neuss’s main arguments run as follows. Firstly, there is no reason to assume that ‘the year 30’ refers to the Harṣa Era, as has been done by all scholars following Bloch \(see above\), apart from Majumdar, who takes it to refer to the Gupta Era. Nuess refers to Asher, who had argued ‘that in the ancient written documents of eastern India, time was almost invariably marked according to the regnal year of a current monarch’, 15 and, Neuss continues, ‘that there is thus no basis to connect the date of our inscription with any known era’. 16

Secondly, a detailed palæographic investigation leads him to the final observation that, 

As the Muṇḍeśvarī record still uses the older tripartite ya, I would suggest that the Muṇḍeśvarī inscription must have been engraved between A.d. 570 and A.d. 

590, and that the script shows influences from writing habits developed in Western India. 17

I subscribe tentatively to Neuss’s analysis and would therefore propose to date the inscription to the second half of the sixth or early seventh century. It follows that the otherwise completely unknown Mahāsāmanta Udayasena was a feuda-

tory, not of Harṣavardhana, but of the Maukharis of Kanauj, and most likely ruled under Avantivarman, the last of the great Maukhari kings of Kanauj, whose reign spanned the final decades of the sixth and beginning of the seventh century. The inscription is not the foundation charter of the main temple itself, but it testifies to a historical process in the second half of the 6th century, in which the building of a new religious complex on the hill was in full swing. 

Neuss presents a new edition of the inscription and his interpretation thereof has important consequences for his understanding of the type and development of the sacred complex on the hill. The reading and interpretation of the inscription that I present here differ significantly from the one given by Neuss. 

Our disagreement is mainly the result of a different interpretation of the signs that are found at the end of line 6 and 11 and in the middle of line 16:

. 

Neuss, following Majumdar, takes these as daṇḍas  that conclude a sentence. 

13 Neuss 2003, 543. The temple has a long history of reconstructions. Its architectural history has been investigated by Adam Hardy and Fiona Buckee. Buckee \( forthcoming\) concludes that the present octagonal shape of the temple may go back to a reconstruction, influenced by nearby Suri tombs, made in the 16th or 17th century. The present appearance of the temple is due to a ‘creative restauration’ made between 1913–1916.

In my view this interpretation is untenable, because it would break up the sentence constructioṇ In line 6 the Sanskrit syntax requires that we do not read a pause after ◦ devakulasya, since this is the adject of upanibandhaḥ kāritaḥ 

in line 9. If we would take this sign as a daṇḍa  in line 11, it would separate

the subject from the predicate: . . . ◦ upakaran

. āni . . . dattāni \(l. 12\). For these

reasons I follow the suggestion first made by Banerji to the effect that, ‘The sign at the end of this line has been added in order to fill up the vacant space.’ 18

Similar scroll-work is, for instance, found at the end of line 3 \(after the double daṇḍa  that concludes v. 4\) of the so-called ‘Jaunpur Stone Inscription of

Īśānavarman’.19 In line 16 of our inscription the double scroll sign is used to fill up the line and, concomitantly, to mark a new paragraph, uktaṁca, so that

the concluding, exhortative verse could begin on a new line. 

My edition is presented in two ways: first, a literal transliteration of what is readable; second, an edited version with conjectural emendations and standardized orthography. My study is based on the estampage supplied by Sten Konow and published by Banerji in Epigraphia Indica IX \(Plate 82\).

the i  above the n  in nikāyaṁin the next line\) of the akṣara ya, of which the third vertical stroke may have broken off. It looks as if there is an anusvāra  above this i-mātrā, but

this may be just damage or there might have been one more akṣara  on this line, pressed together due to lack of space \(cf. the haplography that occurs at the end of line 8 where

◦ dvayaṁshould be read as ◦ dvayasya\).

22 Irregular for triṁśattame, maybe under influence of the following dvāviṁśatime, which

is haplographic for dvāviṁśatitame \(Oberlies 2003, 127\). As argued above the year 30

is best explained, if we assume that it refers to regnal years. The only dated Maukhari inscription \(the Haraha Inscription of ¯

Iśānavarman, EI XIV, 110–20\) is assigned to the

Vikrama Era, 611 \(ad 554\). The dates on the Maukhari coins are problematic: difficult to read and difficult to assign to any known era \(see Burn 1906; EI XIV, 113; HCI III, 70\). I presume with Asher, Neuss, and Singh that the present ‘year 30’ refers to the thirtieth year of Udayasena’s governorship \( rājya\). 

23 Maybe to be emended to asyāṁ. As it stands, I take this synonymous with atra  or iha. 

24 The reading ◦ rājodayasena◦ was first proposed by Banerji and taken over by all later editors. 

That we are here concerned with a feudatory rather than a sovereign king follows from his titles \(three \(of five\) Mahāśabdas\), bestowed upon him by a suzerain:

mahāsāmanta, ‘feudatory’; mahāpratīhāra, ‘chief chamberlain’; mahārāja, ‘viceroy’. The

monarch who had bestowed these titles may have been either Śarvavarman or Avantivarman, Maukhari kings of Kanauj, who were themselves called great on account of their overlordship of Magadhā’ \( magadhādhipatyamahatām\), in the Sirpur Lakṣmaṇa Temple

Stone Inscription of the time of Śivagupta Bālārjuna \(Shastri 1995 II, 143; EI XI, 191\). 

25 For this reading see above ṇ 20 on p. 396. 

As has been remarked by Sanderson \(e-

mail 15-2-2012\), the beginning with bhā  suggests a Pāśupata name, but no satisfactory

interpretation has suggested itself. I conjecture bhānūdayiṁ, assuming that the curve

to the left at the bottom \(note also the little vertical stroke above the akṣara\) indicate the long vowel ū; cf. nu  in line 18. The noun udayin  is declined here as a vowel stem in i \(Oberlies 2003, 94\). 

26 Banerji reads maṭham etat kāritaka ˙

m, but Majumdar noted that the inscription actually reads mayetat kāritakaṁ. We agree with Banerji, just as Neuss \(cf. Srinivasan 1991, 315\). 

The end of this sentence kāritakaṁremains noticeable \(cf. Fleet in CII III, 69, 113, 135; Oberlies 2003, 267 ṇ 3\). 

27 The syntax requires that we read ◦ dvayasya, as first suggested by Majumdar̥ 

28 The reading copanibandhaḥ , proposed by Banerji, was taken over by all later editors.

Success\! 

In the thirtieth year, at the twenty-second day of Kārttika; here, at the

above year, month and day—within the reign of the illustrious Mahāsāmanta, 

Mahāpratīhāra, Mahārāja Udayasena—after having requested the permission

of the head of the community \( kulapati\), Bhānūdayin \(?\), and the Temple

Council, General Gomibhaṭa has commissioned the building of this accomodation as part of the Vinīteśvaramaṭha, in order to increase the merit of his father, mother, and himself. 

He has made an assignment to the temple of the illustrious Nārāyaṇa of a pala

of lampoil and two prasthas  of rice for the daily food-offering \(to the deity\), permanently, for as long as sun and moon exist, to be taken from the storeroom that belongs to the temple of the illustrious Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmiṇ

20 / The Temple of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin

399

regular set of various observances for the sake of the illustrious feet of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmiṇ 

Having learned so, there should not be a disruption of what has thus been assigned, neither by future incumbents nor by the ascetics. 

The one who, having thus been informed, acts otherwise, will live in hell with great sins. 

Thus \[. . . \]

And it has been declared, 

O Yudhiṣṭhira, zealously protect the land, whether it has been given by yourself or by others. O foremost of the landlords, protection is superior to giving. 

Interpretation

General Gomibhaṭa made altogether three donations, for which he had to make two formal requests, namely one to the head \( kulapati\) of the Vinīteśvara\(maṭha\), and the other to the Temple Council \( devanikāya\), of which he himself may have been a member̥ 37 The task of the Devanikāya may have

been to supervise and administer the temple properties on the hill and that of the Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin temple complex \( devakula\) in particular̥ The membership of general Gomibhaṭa of such a council would not be surprising, if we consider the people who are reported to sit on such a council. To this effect the Taleśvara Copperplate Grant of Dyutivarman provides informatioṇ 38 The latter grant was made at the request of the Mahāsattrapati Trāta and the Deva-

nikāya, ‘which was headed by the minister Bhadraviṣṇu, the governor of the fort, the officer in charge of the king’s betel-box, the custodian of the sacrificial fire, and the head of the royal guard’. 39

Gomibhaṭa needed the permission of kulapati  Bhānūdayin for his first donation, viz. accomodation or housing \( maṭha\) for the ascetics, since that was to be built on the premises of the Vinīteśvaramaṭha. The word kulapati  poses a problem. Literally it signifies ‘head of a community’. Because the community here is defined as that of a maṭha, a likely interpretation is that the kulapati  is 37 If we read with Neuss svadevanikāya  in l. 4, this membership would be expliciṭ

Though they appear to be forgeries, they are nevertheless documents pertaining to the period ‘between the middle of the 6th and second quarter of the 7th century’ \(Gupte op. ciṭ  113\), i.e. to the same period as to which the Muṇḍeśvarī

Inscription belongs.

the Mahant or abbot of the community of ascetics \( tāpovanikas\) of the Vinī-

teśvaramaṭha.40 Alternatively, as was pointed out to me in the conference, kulapati  may be shorthand for devakulapati, ‘head of the temple’, in which case probably the temple connected to the maṭha  was meanṭ 

He needed the approval of the Temple Council for his second donation, viz. 

a daily offering of lampoil and rice meant for the Nārāyaṇa Temple \( devakula\), 

since this was to be taken from the storeroom \( koṣṭhikā\) connected to the Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin Temple. How this was paid for remains unclear, unless we assume that the third donation to the Temple Council was considered to be sufficient to cover the costs of this as well. 

His third donation to the Temple Council, for which he also needed approval, was meant for the worship of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin himself and is said to have had a value of 50 dīnāras. For this amount he provided the means needed for worshipping the deity, such as milk \(a cow\), food and garlands, epitomized in the words vicitrakarmāntatantra◦ \(regular set of various observances\), if our conjecture \(l. 10\) is correcṭ 

The inscription attests to the existence, in the second half of the 6th century, of a main Śaiva temple complex, called Maṇḍaleśvara. Connected to this temple was a storeroom, which could also supply the daily offerings for a minor Vaiṣṇava sanctuary dedicated to Nārāyaṇa. In addition, and possibly closely connected to the Maṇḍaleśvara complex, was a monastery of Śaiva ascetics, named Vinīteśvaramaṭha. Whether there was a temple or shrine of Vinīteśvara cannot be deduced from this inscription with certainty, but the existence at the time of such a temple is very likely indeed. The monastery or/and its temple was headed by Bhānūdayiṇ 

Maṇḍaleśvara and the Skandapurāṇa

This is as far as epigraphy \(and archaeology\) can bring us. It does not tell us why ascetics and pilgrims flocked to this hill in great numbers. Why the site was considered holy. In order to answer these questions we need texts, and such a text has become available. I refer to the original Skandapurāṇa. 

In the context of the Kauśikī Cycle the Skandapurāṇa contains a Maṇḍa-

leśvara Māhātmya. 41 This Māhātmya tells the story of the demons Sunda

and Nisunda and the nymph Tilottamā, also known from the Mahābhārata, 42

which serves as an aetiological myth of the origin of the caturmukhaliṅga.

20 / The Temple of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin

401

Tilottamā, her creator Brahmā, and the other gods assemble in the Vindhyas

for worshipping Śiva, but he is invisible at firsṭ Then Śiva appears on the scene in the form of a liṅga. When Tilottamā makes her pradakṣiṇā  around him \(and

the gods\), four faces emerge on the four sides of the liṅga, which gives her the power of sexual desire, the tejas, namely, that had been stored within Śiva ever since he had burnt Madana. Thus the caturmukhaliṅga  comes into being \(SP

62.8–26\). Then Śiva says that, 

Because she \[Tilottamā\], as well as the gods, has circumambulated Him in a circle \( maṇḍala\), this place on Mṭ Vindhya, which is sacred to Him, will be called Ma-ṇḍaleśvara, and He will always be present here. 43

The story continues, again in the words of Yokochi. 

After sending Tilottamā to the demons, all the gods huddle together̥ They see Parameśvara in their midsṭ Because He appeared in the midst of the gods while they were huddling together \( piṇḍyamāna\), He was called Piṇḍāreśvara there. 44

A holy place called Piṇḍāraka is known to the Mahābhārata \(MBh 13.26.54\), and other places with this name are known to several Purāṇas. 

The

Piṇḍāreśvara at issue, however, must be located in the vicinity of Maṇḍaleśvara. 

The word piṇḍāra  means mendicant and the aetiological myth told in the Skandapurāṇa probably refers to a local liṅga  that was worshipped by Śaiva ascetics. 

The place where our text locates these two liṅgas  is in the northern part of the Vindhyas, since Tilottamā is said to go to the south to find the two demons

in the foothills of the Vindhya \( vindhyapādeṣu\). Our investigation thus seems to

corroborate Yokochi’s hypothesis, to the effect that both Skandapurāṇa liṅgas

are to be situated on the Muṇḍeśvarī Hill— the Maṇḍaleśvara being the ancient caturmukhaliṅga  preserved on the site near the main, octagonal temple and named as such in the Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription, Year 30, and the Piṇḍāreśvara being one of the many of 5th to 7th century liṅgas  that are scattered all over the hill, possibly the 5th or 6th century ekamukhaliṅga  found at site A. 45

Once the hill had established its reputation, it began to attract patronage of the elite. Gomibhaṭa exemplifies this development and we have suggested elsewhere that the Vinīteśvara temple may have been founded by someone named Vinīta, who may have ruled from the stronghold of near-by Rohitāgiri, Rohtasgarh. 48

The inscription and earliest archaeological material on the hill belong to the period in which we date the beginning of the Skandapurāṇa composition, that

is after ad 550, when North India became united again, for the first time since the fall of the Gupta Empire, under the Maukhari rulers, whose homeland was in the near-by valley of the River Soṇ

or maṭhas  in centres of pilgrimage that were on the rise, such as Vārāṇasī. 

Muṇḍeśvarī Hill, that is Maṇḍaleśvara, may have been a knot in the emerging network of Pāśupata ascetics, important enough to deserve a Māhātmya of its

own in one of the movement’s greatest literary undertakings, the Purāṇa of

Skanda. 49
