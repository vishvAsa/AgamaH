The Case of Vārāṇasī

I do homage to Sarasvatī and Ga ˙

ngā, 

both holy and enchanting streams; 

the latter washes away the sin of him

who bathes therein and drinks of its waters; 

the former destroys the ignorance

of him who speaks or hears of iṭ 

\(RCM 1 C15.1, tr̥ Hill\)

Introduction

In the eulogizing stanzas that precede the Acts of Rāma, Tulsīdās makes a

curious remark:

\[I do homage\] to Hara, too, and Girijā, who for the good of the world and with regard to the evil of this age composed a number of spells in a barbarous tongue, incongruous syllables, meaningless mutterings, whose influence is manifest by the power of Maheśa. \(RCM 1 C15.3, tr̥ Hill\)

When Śiva can empower even meaningless mutterings, how great then would be the effect if he empowered meaningful truths? 

If the grace of Hara and Gaurī be at all truly with me, then all the influence I claim for my verses, composed in common speech, will be a reality. 

\(RCM 1 D15, tr̥ Hill\)

These words have a special significance, since they touch upon a general development in the religions of northern India, an evolution from an increasingly abstruse, technical tantric religion taught in the Śaiva āgamas in a lan-

guage that ever fewer people could understand—sometimes even resorting to saṁdhyābhāṣa  or obstruse language—to a more simple religion of the heart, a devotion expressed in plain words of the vernaculars that have an immediate appeal to human emotions.

Śiva as lord of the mantra preserved his position of eminence, but how much more effective would he be, if he employed meaningful language, Tulsīdās seems

to say. The Rāmacaritamānasa \(RCM\) is itself a specimen of this development, 

which we can trace several centuries back; seen in that perspective we may consider the Mānasa as an end-point rather than a beginning. 

Yet another, older conflict is hidden behind this evolution, viz. the rivalry between the Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava religions. Although some schools of Vaisnavism had borrowed the technical ritualistic formalism from āgamic Saivism, 1

Vaisnavism, by its nature, could more easily accommodate to less elitist, more emotional forms of worship that were on the rise in northern India from the 11th century onwards. This advantage had its effect especially in Hindu holy places, where great interests were at stake, and which were frequented by a growing stream of devotees expressing popular forms of religioṇ Unlike newly emerging holy places like Ayodhyā and Braj, which were predominantly within

the Vaiṣṇava domain from the beginning, an old, overall Śaiva holy place like Vārāṇasī must have been the theatre par excellence, in which this competition came to the fore. 

Tulsīdās, Śiva, and the Name

In all his writings Tulsīdās gives Śiva his due, and more than that, he beseeches Śambhu to grant him attachment to Rāma’s feeṭ Śiva’s divine grace operating

in Vārāṇasī is fully acknowledged, for instance, in the opening verses of Tulsī’s Vinayapatrikā:

That state which saints, scriptures and all the Purānas tell as hard won, even by

great sages, 

That salvation eternal Shiva gives to all alike whose hour of death is in his city. 

\(VP v. 3, tr̥ Allchin\)

Indeed, it is an ancient tradition that bestows on Vārāṇasī the power to release

those who die within its precincts, a power derived from Śiva’s grace. We shall examine the history of this doctrine, but for doing this we take our cue from the Rāmacaritamānasa. 

In the prologue of the Bālakhaṇḍa Tulsī sings the praise of the holy Name

consisting of two akṣaras: rā-ma. To highlight its effectiveness he attributes

all sorts of miraculous powers to it, including Śiva’s grace. Then, coming to Vārāṇasī, Tulsī says:

I do homage to rāma, the Name of Raghubar, signifying fire and sun and moon; essence of Brahmā, Hari and Hara; vital breath of the Veda; impersonal, unique, treasure-house of all perfections; the Great Spell \(Mahāmantra\) uttered by Maheśa, 

who teaches it as effecting final release at Kāśī. Gaṇeśa knows its power, for by

the might of the Name he is first to be worshipped. \(RCM 1 C19.1–2, tr̥ Hill\) 1 Sanderson 2001, 35–41. 



23 / Rāma Devotion in a Śaiva Holy Place

465

A little further on Tulsī is even more precise and specifies that it is this Mahā-

mantra, equated with the Name, that grants release to the dying, when it is compassionately bestowed upon them by Śiva himself:

The immortal Śa ˙

mbhu, Śiva, the Blessed Lord, sum of all knowledge and perfection, continually repeats it, and the four kinds of creatures that are in the world win to the highest realm if they die at Kāśī; \(2\)

and that too, O prince of sages, is due to the greatness of Rāma, for Śiva of his

compassion instructs them in the power of the Name. I ask you, lord, which Rāma

is this? Tell me and explain, O treasure-house of grace\! \(3\) \(RCM 1 C46.2–3, tr̥ Hill\)

More pedestrian as we are, our answer differs from that of the prince of sages, Yājñavalkya; we will look for the origin of this doctrine to the beginnings of the Rāma bhakti  in northern India in the 11th and 12th centuries ad. This new form of devotion that envisaged the hero of the Rāmāyaṇa as the highest form and

manifestation of Viṣṇu was from the start, it would seem, intrinsically linked to the cult of the divine Name. Tulsī reports the outcome of the development in which Name and God became equated: the Name of Rāma is the supreme

mantra, which alone can deliver the supreme goal, final release. 

The claims of Śaiva texts and pandits in Vārāṇasī to the effect that it is

Śiva who mercifully whispers the Mahāmantra into the ear of the dying, as

a sort of last sacrament, is not false by itself, so the reasoning goes, but this Mahāmantra cannot be another than the supreme mantra, the Name of God. 

So all the Śaiva followers who had always believed that this release-granting formula would be a Śaiva mantra had been mistaken and they must have been in for a big surprise in their hours of death. 

The syllables of this mantra were not given in the early Śaiva texts, as far as I am aware, being a mystery to be revealed by Śiva himself at the moment of dying. From this mystery the Vaiṣṇavas cleverly made use when they claimed the mantra. 

The Agastyasaṁhitā

The earliest text that bears testimony to this reframing of an ancient doctrine is the Agastyasaṁhitā. I have dealt with this text extensively in Bakker 1986, and a critical edition of it was prepared by Roelf Barkhuis as his PhD thesis \(1995\). For the first twenty-three chapters I am using his editioṇ We have dated the text before the Islamic revolution and its place of origin, it has been conjectured, may well have been Benares. 

In chapter 7 we read that many devotees \( upāsakāḥ \) resort to Vārāṇasī, 

wishing to obtain release \( mumukṣavah. \). Continuously they repeat ‘śiva śiva’, and Śiva, hearing this, thinks to himself: ‘how could I bestow mukti  to them?’

Śiva asks Brahmā, who tells him that a means \( upāya\) does exists. Brahmā

initiates Śiva in the ṣaḍakṣara, the Mantrarāja, on the bank of the Gaṅgā in Vārāṇasī at Lolārka on a Sūryaparvan day \(AgS 7.14–15\). After japa  and other devout practices for a long period, Rāma appears to Śiva and is ready to fulfil

his wishes:

Rāma said:

They, indeed, who have died in your holy field, O Lord of the gods, no matter where, even worms, insects and the like, they shall immediately attain release and this will not be otherwise. \(26\)

Those who obtain, either from you or Brahmā, the Six-syllable Mantra, 

they shall be mantrasiddhas  during their lifetimes and, when they die, shall reach me. \(27\)

And, O Śaṁkara, when one worships devoutly in this holy field with this mantra, there I shall be present, in stones, images etc. \(28\) Or, when you yourself specifies my mantra in the right ear of one who longs for release, no matter who he is, he shall be released, O Śiva. \(29\) When the God of gods had thus spoken, Śaṁkara answered: My preten-

tion is great here, in this unique holy place, \(30\)

May final release be the fruit for everyone, O God of gods; and I shall give the supreme boon to all those who are about to die: the mantra. 

\(31\) 2

In reading the Agastyasaṁhitā again, it struck me that the text actually seems

to distinguish between the so-called ṣaḍakṣara mantra \( rāṁrāmāya namaḥ \), 

in which Brahmā and Śiva were initiated and which mantra should be used to call Rāma’s presence in all sorts of ritual circumstances, and ‘my mantra’

\( manmantra\), in which mad  refers to Rāma and which Śiva whispers into the

ear of the dying. Until now I had assumed that these two mantras were one and the same, but the tradition of the name as expressed by Tulsī and the AgS

itself, 3 and the fact that the AgS refers to the powerless Śaiva equivalent as śiva, now suggest to me that the text may have actualy meant rāma. 4

2 AgS 7.26–31:

The Rāmottaratāpanīyopaniṣad § 4 21–25 borrows this passage from the Ags. 

3 See e.g. AgS 3.25: rāma rāmeti rakṣeti ye vandanty api pāpinah. | pāpakoṭisahasrebhyas tān uddharati nānyathā  k 25 k \(half of the MSS read rāmeti  instead of rakṣeti\); AgS

23 / Rāma Devotion in a Śaiva Holy Place

467

This was really a dashing feat of the Vārāṇasī Ramaite pandits: to tell their

clientele that in the hour of death Śiva will come to their rescue by whispering rāma into their right ears. This is no longer a specimen of ‘Inklusivismus’, for which the Indian religions are renowned, this is downright appropriatioṇ 

Lolārka

The choice for Lolārka as the place of Śiva’s own initiation into the Six-syllable mantra may not have been arbitrary. Dedicated to Sūrya, it was one of the

main, non-Śaiva temples in Vārāṇasī in the 12th century. The inscriptions of

the Gāhaḍavāla kings, who were staunch Vaiṣṇavas, mention only two Vārānaṣī temples by name in which the royal family performed pūjā, ādikeśava and

Lolārka, on the two extreme ends, north and south, of the Avimuktakṣetra. 

A queen of Govindacandra, Gosaladevī, issued a charter, after a bath in the Ganges, in front of the deity Lolārka in ad 1150.5 The same deity was the

recipient of a grant given by Jayacandra in ad 1177 \(EI IV, 128 f.\). The important Lolārka is located near the confluence of the Ganges with the so-called Asi River at the southern tip of the holy kṣetra. 

Somehow this area of Benares remained connected with the worship of Rāma. 

Tulsīdās is said to have settled at what is now called Tulsī Ghāṭ, adjacent to

the Lolārka compound and tradition has it that he died at the neighbouring Asighāṭ in 1623 at the age of 80 \( assī\). 

The tradition of the Saving Mantra

For the origin of the doctrine of salvation, which has contributed so much to the greatness of Vārāṇasī as a centre of pilgrimage, we have to examine the Śaiva sources concerned with this holy place. 

The Kāśīkhaṇḍa

To the Kāśīkhaṇḍa \(KKh\) this great mantra is known as the Tāraka bra-

hman/ mantra, ‘the saving formula’. KKh 1.7.79 reads in the eulogy that is a nirukti  of Maṇikarṇikā:

́

Because Siva, thought-gem \( maṇi\) to \(all\) those who are floating on the ocean of existence, speaks here \(in Maṇikarṇikā\), all at once in the hour of death, that mumūrṣor maṇikarṇyāṁtu ardhodakanivāsinaḥ |

ahaṁdiśāmi te mantraṁtārakaṁbrahmadāyakam  k 40 k

The second of these two verses \(with minor variants\) is quoted by Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa \(c. 

ad 1513–1570\) in his Tristhalīsetu p. 291 together with an additional half verse \(not found in the Venkatesvara edition of the Padmapurāṇa\):

śrīrāmarāmarāmeti etat tārakam ucyate  k iti  k

See also Bakker 1986 I, 76.

468

Hans Bakker

saving \(mantra\) into the ear \( karṇikā\) of the good people, for that reason that

\(place here\) is hailed as Maṇikarṇikā. 6

Similarly in the Māhātmya of Avimukta:

When one departs from life there, Viśveśvara himself recites the saving formula, due to which one becomes consubstantiate with him. 7

How successful the Vaiṣṇava pandits have been in their appropriation of a golden Śaiva formula, may become evident from Rāmānanda’s commentary

ad locum, in which tārakaṁbrahma  is glossed as tārakaṁpraṇavaṁṣaḍakṣara-

rāmamantrarājaṁvā \(similar ad  KKh 1.7.79\); this is again taken over, without mentioning of the source and with omission of the praṇava  option, in the trans-

lation of G.V. Tagare in the Ancient Indian Tradition and Mythology Series:

‘Rāma Mantra of six syllableṣ’ The composer of the Kāśīkhaṇḍa himself seems

to have identified the Tāraka mantra with the syllable oṁ. 8

The Kāśīkhaṇḍa is a text that is to be dated after the regime change of ad 1193. It reflects the recovery of the town and the resilience of the Hindu religious spirit in the 13th and 14th centuries, reconstructing the holy place on an unprecedented scale. The composer of the Kāśīkhaṇḍa made use of older

sources, first of all Lakṣmīdhara’s Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa \(TVK\), which quotes the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the Matsyapurāṇa \(MtP\) nearly in its entirety. The

latter Māhātmya may be one of the earliest in which we find the doctrine of the saving mantra. MtP 182.23cd–24ab, quoted by Lakṣmīdhara in TVK p. 17, calls it the karṇajāpa:

For in Avimukta at the hour of death ¯

Iśvara himself presents to those who are

propelled by their karma  the ‘ear-whispering’ \( \(karṇajāpa\). 9

Until recently this was as far as we could get in tracing back this redeeming article of faith. Since the 1990s, however, an old Śaiva source has become available that sheds light on the origin of this doctrine, namely the Skandapurāṇa

\(SP\). I have reported on this long text in many publications and in 2004 the second volume of the critical edition of this Purāṇa has appeared. This volume

contains the Māhātmya of Vārāṇasī, and we estimate that it is the oldest text

of its kind. 

The Skandapurāṇa

Let me briefly recall a few important facts about this texṭ We call it ‘the original Skandapurāṇa’, because the text appears to be about a half millennium older than the oldest khaṇḍas  of the printed Skandapurāṇa, with which it has

hardly anything in common apart from its name. 10 We think it is the first textual composition that carries the name ‘Skandapurāṇa’, which is what the

adjective ‘original’ is meant to indicate, nothing more and nothing less. 

From the 12th century onwards, this original Skandapurāṇa was gradually

replaced by a series of texts that style themselves as khaṇḍas  of the Skanda-

purāṇa. Our text, in the colophons of the three oldest manuscripts, does not refer to itself as a khaṇḍa, but simply as ‘the Skandapurāṇa’. In the 14th century

this replacement had advanced so far that our text was nearly obliterated. 

We can be so certain about the early date of our text because the National Archives in Kathmandu possesses three nine-century manuscripts of this Purāṇa, one of which is dated in Aṁśuvarman Saṁvat 234, i.e. ad 810. The

authenticity of this text is warranted by Lakṣmīdhara, the minister and pandit at the court of the Gāhaḍavāla king Govindacandra in the 12th century, who in his description of Benares quotes extensively from a ‘Skandapurāṇa’. All his

quotes turn out to be from our text, none from the Kāśīkhaṇḍa or any other

khaṇḍa  for that matter̥ 

When the text had reached the point of near-oblivion due to its replacement by later texts styled khaṇḍas, copyists in northeastern India preserved it, be it in the very margins of the Purāṇa text corpus, by renaming it the Ambikā-, or

in one case, by mistake probably, Revākhaṇḍa of the Skandapurāṇa. Collation

of these later manuscripts so named with the three manuscripts from Kathmandu has established that the text had evolved into a new recension that substantially differs from the ‘Nepalese’ texṭ We refer to this new recension as the RA recension to distinguish it from the S recension, which refers to the text as found in the Nepalese manuscripts. When we collate the quotations in Lakṣmīdhara’s Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa with the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the original Skandapurāṇa, it becomes clear that an early form of this RA recension already existed in the 12th century and was used by the Nibandha author \(Bisschop 2002\). Further research into the history of this text has made it plausible that the new recension was created in one major redaction that took place somewhere in North India, most likely in the ninth century. 11

The original text, we estimate, was composed either under the Maukhari kings or Harṣavardhana of Kanauj, in the second half of the sixth or first half of the seventh century. 12

12 In Bakker 2014, 137 I argued that the most likely time span is ad 570 to 620.

Textual criticism

Different from what some believe, this philological work is not a blind hunt for

‘the original’ in which all readings of later recensions, Are damned to the rubbish heap of the ‘critical apparatus’, which appears in published form as a mystifying jumble of characters and symbols creeping along the bottom of the pages. 13

Our method aims at precisely the opposite, namely to distinguish between various layers in the text transmission, in order to be in a position to value each stage through which the text evolved on its own merits as a reflection of its time. And in this assessment the later recensions are equally valuable to us as ‘the original’ or what comes closest to iṭ Far from being a ‘rubbish heap’, the critical apparatus thus appears to be a precious store house of historical informatioṇ 

At the risk of being decried an inveterate ‘orientalist’, I would like to illustrate this method, finally, by tracing the doctrine of the saving mantra in the text tradition of the Skandapurāṇa. 

The saving mantra in the Skandapurāṇa

In adhyāya  30 of the SP, that is in the middle of the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya, 

we read in verse 50 that ‘the devotee who dedicates all his activity to Śiva attains final release here in the Avimuktakṣetra, more easily than anywhere else’. This verse is found in all MSs. Immediately following this verse, however, the RA recension has two interesting verses, which are given in the critical apparatus. 

Men who are dedicated to japa  and meditation as well as those who are slow-witted and deluded in matters of knowledge—their minds orientated towards external things—they \(all\) reach their goal in Vārāṇasī:

Here, in the hour of death, Maheśvara himself gives \(them\) the saving mantra \( tārakaṁbrahma\), thanks to which one becomes consubstantiated with Him. 14

The second of these verses we have already encountered in a slightly modified form in the Māhātmya of Avimukta in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa \(KKh 1.25.73\). This

verse corresponds also closely with a prose passage in the Jābāla Upaniṣad

\(JābU 1\). This prose passage contains two metrically correct uneven Śloka pādas \(beginning with prāṇeo. . . 

and yenāsāv. . . , below ṇ 15 on p. 470 f.\), 

which may be an indication that the Upaniṣad text derived from a metrical exemplar, which might have been close to the verse found in the RA recensioṇ 15

13 Smith 2006, 25. 

14 Skandapurāṇa RA Recension 30.50 \(1–2\):

15 The prose text runs \(correspondences with the RA recension of the SP in bold face\): 

23 / Rāma Devotion in a Śaiva Holy Place

471

It probably was a Śloka that people knew by heart and had a more or less independent, floating existence, and so found its way into the Upaniṣad on the one hand, and into the Kāśīkhaṇḍa on the other̥ The RA recension of the

Skandapurāṇa might be its first attestatioṇ 

As already observed, the doctrine of the saving mantra is also known to the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the Matsyapurāṇa where it is called the karṇajāpa. A

collation of the Māhātmyas in the Matsyapurāṇa and the Skandapurāṇa has

proven beyond reasonable doubt that the Matsya borrowed from the Skanda, but it used the older Nepalese recensioṇ 16 This, combined with the fact that both the Matsya and the revised Skanda record this doctrine of the saving mantra independently, has led us to the hypothesis that the RA redaction and the composition of the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the Matsyapurāṇa belong

approximately to the same period: the 8th to 9th centuries aḍ17

It is during this period that this doctrine became widely accepted and met with the approval of orthodox brahmins and Paurāṇikas. Its origin might have

been earlier̥ This new doctrine, namely, is connected with the inclusion of the cremation ground \( śmaśāna\) within the sacred fabric of Vārāṇasī. It may be

conceived as a landmark in the history of the holy town: a change of paradigm by which the cremation ground, from being tabooed, became hallowed and was accommodated to the holy kṣetra. This last remark requires some explanation, and for that we turn to the oldest, ‘Nepalese’ or S recension of our texṭ 

Avimukta

Vārāṇasī’s connection with death, the catering for the needs of the moribund, goes back at least to Gupta times and is a dominant feature until today. It is strongly represented in the oldest form of the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the

Skandapurāṇa. This Māhātmya, which dates back to the 6th or 7th century, 

describes first the primordial situation, when the holy field was covered by a divine garden called udyāna  or devodyāna. Śiva, who has taken residence there

forever \(a nirukti  of avimukta\), shows Pārvatī the garden and the liṅgas  in

it, which are either svayaṁbhu  or have been installed by various gods, twelve altogether̥ Avimukteśvara is not included within this dozen, as it is conceived of as Śiva’s own residence in Vārāṇasī. 

The twelve primordial liṅgas  on the other hand are enumerated in such a way that they may be seen as forming a pattern, some sort of circuit around the Avimuktakṣetra, i.e. around the Avimukteśvara sanctuary \(Figure 12\).18

Avimuktakṣetra

The twelve li ˙

nga sanctuaries encircling Avimukteśvara

The town is, on the one hand, described as a meeting place of yogis, in particular of the Pāśupata variety, on the other hand as a place where one should wish to die, as this promises immediate release. It is therefore all the more conspicuous that the cremation ground itself, the Śmaśāna, is not mentioned with one word. 

That is to say, it is not mentioned in the recension that is preserved in the Nepalese manuscripts \(S\). The later RA recension has, in addition to the two verses that we have quoted \(above, ṇ 14 on p. 470\), made some other highly

473

significant changes. Outside the Māhātmya proper, in SP 167, which gives

a survey of the major Śaiva āyatanas  including Vārāṇasī, and of which the

texts in S and RA diverge widely, the eulogy of Avimukta of the S recension is replaced in RA by a passage mentioning the śmaśāna, known under the name

of ‘Avimuktaka’. This brings the RA recension of the SP again alongside the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the Matsyapurāṇa, which is for the greater part a eulogy

of Avimukta as cremation ground. 

Conclusion

Although Benares from its inception as a holy place has been connected with death and the belief that dying in the vicinity of the Avimukteśvara Temple would bring immediate release, attested already in the Mahābhārata, 19 the

strongly felt polluting nature of the dead themselves and the disposal of their bodies made that originally the śmaśāna  was considered beyond the pale of

sanctified ground. 

This cremation ground was there, as it was in every Indian city, and in one of the earliest Purāṇas, the Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa, it is depicted as the unholiest place on earth, the place where king Hariścandra passed his doleful days as a caṇḍāla. 20 If we assume that its location has not altered over the centuries, a location that is known in later sources as Maṇikarṇikā, it lay in the early days at the southern fringe of the then holy field, as it should do. 21 With the growth of the town, however, and the omnipresence of the dying along with the industry that surrounded them, this is beginning to change in the seventh and eighth centuries. An important factor in this process has been the spread of the belief that salvation would be available to all, if only the dying days were spent in the holy towṇ The doctrine of the saving mantra, administered there, and only there, all’ultimo momento, made Vārāṇasī stand out against

all other competing holy places that promised mokṣa; this doctrine has thus greatly contributed to the reputation of the city as the most holy place on earth. 

No wonder therefore that, when a wind of change was blowing through northern India in the 11th and 12th centuries, new religious communities jumbed on the bandwagoṇ The pandits of the emerging Ramaite faith and the cult of the Name in particular were most successful. The ingenuity and flexibility of the Indian religious mind created fresh forms of devotion, in which the old was preserved and the new could flourish. Awareness of this historical process makes that we can now fully appreciate the opening couplets of Tulsīdās’ Vinayapa-

trikā, which may have been composed in Vārāṇasī, when the poet felt that ‘his

Whom else to beg from saving Shambu? 

Compassionate on the

wretched, dispelling the afflictions of devotees, in all ways worthy, blessed Lord; 

When gods and demons burnt in the deadly Kālakūta’s fury, keeping

your vow you drank that poison; When the horrid demon made sorrowful the world, you struck him and his three cities with one arrow down; That state which saints, scripture and all the Purānas tell as hard-

won, even by great sages, That salvation eternal Shiva gives to all alike whose hour of death is in his city; 

In serving easy of access, noble wish-granting tree, lord of Pārvatī, 

most wise, Abode of mercy, enemy of the Love god, give Tulsī Dās at-

tachment to Rām’s feet\!
