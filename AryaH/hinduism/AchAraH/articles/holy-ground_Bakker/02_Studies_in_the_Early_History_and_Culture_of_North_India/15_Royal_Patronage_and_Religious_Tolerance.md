The Formative Period of Gupta–Vākāṭaka Culture

Udayagiri

When, at the beginning of the 5th century, the royal elephant carrying his majesty climbed the slopes of the Udayagiri for a visit to the sacred complex, Emperor Candragupta made sure not to give offence to any of the parties involved in his grand projecṭ His aim was clearly defined in the inscription that records his visit, namely the winning of the entire earth: He \(Vīrasena\) has come here in the company of the king himself, who was on his way of winning the entire earth, and he has commissioned this cave out of devotion for Lord Śambhu. 1

Though himself a devotee of Viṣṇu and so a Bhāgavata, the king paid his respect to his learned chief minister Vīrasena, who came from Pāṭaliputra, by

visiting the cave dedicated to Lord Śambhu, i.e. Śiva, which had recently be completed under the patronage of the chief minister̥ The chief minister was content and proudly recorded the honour that had been bestowed upon him in an inscription at the back of the cave. However, this rather insignificant Cave 8, which probably enshrined a liṅga, can hardly have been the main purpose of Candragupta’s visiṭ 2 For, next door, around the corner, a truly grandiose scheme had just been, or was about to being accomplished, a work of art that was designed to broadcast the king’s larger ambition: ‘the winning of the entire earth’, expressed allegorically in the great Varāha panel of Cave 5. 

As Michael Willis \(2004, 2009\) has shown, the Varāha panel was intrinsically

connected through a system of hydrological engineering with a natural cleft in the central ridge of the mountaiṇ Water once cascaded down through this narrow passage, flowing underneath a large image of Viṣṇu–Nārāyaṇa. This panel shows the god in his cosmic sleep while resting on the primordial snake \(Anantaśayana\), floating on the cosmic oceaṇ At the bottom of the cascade, the water was collected in a resevoir at the feet of the Varāha sculpture of Cave

5, making the cosmic boar rise out of the waters.

It will not be our aim here to analyze the iconography and the allegorical double-entendre of these two panels, the Varāha and the Nārāyaṇa, which

most recently has been done by Willis in a penetrating study referred to above. 3

What concerns us here is the ecumenicity of the situation: a Vaiṣṇava king, 

‘whose prowess is \[Viṣṇu’s\] Cakra’,4 selects a prominent spot at the centre of the holy mountain of Udayagiri for celebrating his faith and political mission, and allows at the same time two leading figures of his kingdom, a minister \(Vīrasena\) and a vassal king \(the Sanakānika mahārāja  Soḍhala \(?\)\), to con-

struct next door cave-sanctuaries \(Caves 6 and 8\) dedicated to Śiva, the other high god of Hinduism. Inscriptions in both shrines duly recognize the sovereignty of Candragupta. 5 Admittedly, we cannot be certain as to the original dedication of the sanctuary of Cave 6—the cave no longer contains its original sculpture—but the two Viṣṇu images at the outer wall, flanking the two Dvārapālas, as well as the image of Gaṇeśa overviewing the entrance at the left and a shrine of the seven mothers at the right of the sanctum, strongly suggest that Cave 6 was also a Śiva sanctuary, 6 in which the two Viṣṇu images, in the words of Joanna Williams, were merely ‘attendant upon the greater glory of Śiva’. 7

And, to complete the picture, adjacent to the Varāha cave on the other, 

southern side, was one more Śaiva cave \(4\), enshrining an ekamukhaliṅga. 8

Thus it cannot have escaped the attention of the contemporaneous visitor that, with the establishment of Gupta power over the area, the Bhāgavata religion

had taken pole position, not by ousting its Śaiva rivals, but rather by including them in a subordinate positioṇ By doing so the three caves together mirrored the situation in Cave 6 on a larger scale: Śiva \(Caves 4 & 6\) ‘attendant on the greater glory of’ the Bhagavat \(Cave 5\). Although the majority of the temple structures on the Udayagiri can be assigned to Hindu gods, this by no means excluded other persuasions to establish their own sanctuary on the hill. At the top of the north side of the hill is a cave of the heterodox Jains, which an inscription dates to the reign of Candragupta’s son Kumāragupta \(ge 106 =

ad 436\). ‘The inscription records the dedication of an image of Pārśvanātha.’ 9

5 For the inscription in Cave 6 see Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 82, CII III \(1888\), 21–25. The name of the king, ‘Soḍhala’, is a conjecture of ḍC. Sircar

\(SI I, 279 ṇ 5.\). No king of that name is known otherwise. It is uncertain whether

‘Soḍhala’s’ inscription refers to the construction of the cave sanctuary 6 as a whole. The inscription is placed above the Mahiṣāsuramardinī and one of the Viṣṇu images on the outer wall.

8 According to Joanna Williams \(1982, 86\) this cave may be slightly later than the excavations of caves 5 to 8, but she concedes that ‘the li ˙

Jainism had been favoured in this region by Candragupta’s ill-fated elder brother, Rāmagupta, who commissioned the three images that were reportedly found inside old Besnagar \(Durjanpura\), 1.5 km from Udayagiri. 10 Three inscriptions on the pedestals record basically the same dedication: This image of the Lord, the venerable Puṣpadanta/Candraprabha, was commissioned by the Mahārājādhirāja Śrī Rāmagupta, at the instigation of Celūkṣamaṇa, 

son of Golakyāntī, who is the pupil of the preceptor Sarpasenakṣamaṇa and the grand-pupil of the pāṇipātrika  11 Candrakṣamaṇa, preceptor \( ācārya\) and forbear-ing monk \( kṣamaṇaśramaṇa\). 12

No direct evidence of Buddhist presence in Udayagiri has come to light, the reason for which is not difficult to see: the great, ancient centre of Sanchi, 5 km to the south, naturally attracted all Buddhist devotioṇ This was, for instance, the case when another favourite of Candragupta, āmrakārdava, donated in ge

93 \(= ad 413\), 

An allotment of land, called ‘¯

Iśvaravāsaka’, and a sum of money to the ārya-

saṅgha, or community of the faithful, at the great vihāra  or Buddhist convent of

Kākanādaboṭa, for the purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps. 13

Candragupta’s favours are explicitly said to have contributed to āmrakārdava’s

way and means of life. 14

Thus we possess within a circle of five kilometers from the Udayagiri Caves and within a time frame of a few decades around ad 400, plenty of epigraphical and sculptural evidence that proves that the reign of Samudragupta’s successors ushered in a period of royal patronage that was not limited to one religious denomination only, but was beneficial to all the four major religions of the times: Bhāgavata \(Visnuism\), Māheśvara \(Saivism\), Jaina \(Jainism\) and Bauddha

\(Buddhism\). This is not to say, of course, that the Guptas invented religious patronage, but their rule marked the emergence of kings and courtiers as a major class of patrons, whereas earlier ‘groups of lay people’ were the prominent sponsors. 15 And in contrast to most of the earlier patrons, their patronage 10 The images are presently stored in the State Museum, Bhopal. See Gai 1969; Williams 1982, 25f, 28 f. Bakker 2006, 169, ṇ 9. 

11 In an email dated 17 September 2009, Paul Dundas explained this term to me as follows: pāṇipātrika  I would not take as a title but rather as a eulogistic epithet signifying an ascetic who uses his cupped hands as an alms bowl and thus follows the jinakalpa, the rigorous mode of life of the Jinas. The term usually designates, or came to designate, a Digambara monk.

extended to religions other than their personal persuasions, thus spreading an atmosphere of religious tolerance throughout the realm. 16

Royal patronage

As we will see, this patronage could take the form of financing prestigious building projects as well as lending financial support to religious groups and individuals through gifts of money or land. We do not possess much direct evidence of courtly patronage of individual sculptors, decorators, architects or other artisans who worked in the visual arts, although this must have been substantial. They were paid, of course, and some artists more than others, no doubṭ Since the king himself was the centre of the patronage system, it is remarkable that we do not possess epigraphical testimonies of Candragupta’s own building projects. It looks as if he was satisfied with being credited by his subjects for his goodness, whereas the ones that appear to have been his own monumental plans, such as the Varāha and Nārāyaṇa panels, were apparently so

obvious that they needed no special commemoration in the form of dedicatory inscriptions. 

This large-scale and broad-minded religious patronage practised by the court, which involved the king, his courtiers and officials \( amātya\), favourites

and so-called feudatories \( sāmanta\), 17 enhanced the development of the

classical forms of the Indian religions, as well as their sacred architecture and arṭ It formed part of a wider system of patronage, which operated as a powerful political strategy, through which the king could advance and visualize a religiously sanctified social order \( dharma\), from which his authority as a ruler by God’s grace was deduced. 18 Partly due to this policy, North India became covered with religious monuments of various sorts, a small number of which survived the ages. The Gupta court and its satellites promoted a lifestyle and devotional ethos that obviously was appealing to a broad section 16 Cf. A.K. Narain \(1983\) in Religious Policy and Toleration in Ancient India:

‘Toleration’ in this context means a state’s recognition and protection of the right of private judgement in matters of faith and worship, and a lack of persecution or obstruction of the beliefs and practices of sects and religions other than the king’s owṇ Often the king of ancient India does not get credit for his act of toleration by modern historians beause it is wrongly assumed that toleration is an essential part of his religious practice or of rājadharma. \(Narain 1983, 50\)

17 Ali 2004, 8: ‘It was the activities of the king’s court, composed of dependents and re-tainers, and attented by underlords and vassals, which constituted “government” rather than a putative “administration”.’

18 See Bakker 1992d \(above, p. 153\). This should not be taken as support of a legitimation theory which, in the words of Daud Ali, ‘suggests the rather unlikely and even anachronistic scenario of the court acting collectively on the basis of certain principles, and then representing them back to itself in order to legitimate them’. On the contary, we subscribe to Ali’s insight that ‘the ideas enshrined in art and literature are in fact identical to the key concepts found in the texts which urge the king and his men to constitute their political actions, which is to say that the supposedly non-ideational realm of power and politics is in fact already ideational’. \(Ali 2004, 14\) 

15 / Royal Patronage and Religious Tolerance 323

of the population; it proved not only to be politically effective, but it lent stability and grandeur to Gupta reign, thanks to which some still speak of ‘the golden age’, or ‘the classical age’. 19

Mandhal

This successful model set an attractive example for other dynasties to follow. 

Influence emanating from the Gupta realm becomes best visible in a dynasty to the south of the Vindhyas with which close relations were established, the Eastern Vākāṭakas of Vidarbha. 

Candragupta had married a princess of the Nāga dynasty \(an old enemy of

his father Samudra\) named Kuberanāgā, by whom he had a daughter̥ This

princess, who came to be known from her own inscriptions by her dynastic name Prabhāvatī Guptā, was married to the Vākāṭaka prince Rudrasena II in about

ad 388. 20 The Nāgas had been a major force in Eastern Malwa and the region around Udayagiri–Vidiśā till the Gupta conquest, and the marriage of a Gupta-Nāga princess with the crown-prince of the Vākāṭakas established a triangular

political relationship between the centre of Gupta power in the Gaṅgā-Yamunā

doab in the north, Vidiśā in the west, and the Eastern Vākāṭaka kingdom in

the south. 21

Rudrasena, once king, inspired it would seem by the example of his in-laws, reinforced a tradition of large-scale religious patronage within the Vākāṭaka

kingdom. 22 Two inscriptions of Rudrasena himself bear testimony to this: the Deoṭek Stone Inscription of Rudrasena and the Mandhal Plates, Year 5. The Deotek palimpsest stone inscription \(Rudrasena overwriting an inscription that 19 Although Daud Ali admits that he has ‘bracketed out the question of religion’, he makes an important observation that is relevant to our subject: In fact, religious and political notions of lordship differed more in degree than kind. 

They formed part of a continuous and homologously structured ‘chain of being’ which linked the entire cosmos. This, on the one hand, meant that the king’s authority and mystique resembled and participated in that of the temple god, giving a theological dimension to relationships at courṭ On the other hand, however, it meant that the life of gods, housed in their sumptuous palaces, shared striking resemblances to those of princes. \(Ali 2004, 104\)

I have earlier argued in a similar line, pointing out, however, that this notion of ‘lordship’

was itself part of a historical process, or, that the ‘degree’ of homology between gods and kings can be demonstrated to have evolved from an analogy in The Gupta/Vākāṭaka

age to a full homology in the centuries before the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate \(Bakker 1992d, 99; above, p. 165\).

apparently pertains to the reign of Aśoka\) records the erection of a Dharmasthāna, evidently in the vicinity of present-day village Deotek on the Beṇṇā or Wainganga River̥ No further details of this building are knowṇ Forty kilometers to the north of it is the findspot of the second Rudrasena inscription, which was found while ploughing a field near the village of Mandhal. 23

The locations of both inscriptions indicate that the earliest political heart of the Vākāṭaka kingdom was along the Wainganga, to the south of Nagpur̥ This may have been the Padmapura District that is known from two inscriptions, one of which is Rudrasena’s Mandhal Plates, the other the Māsod Plates of

Pravarasena II, Year 19. Although the exact size and location of this district is unknown, the area around the present village of Mandhal no doubt belonged to iṭ 24 Padmapura itself must have been the capital of this districṭ This capital features in the so-called ‘Unfinished Durg Plate’ or Mohallā Plate. 25 Closer

consideration of the Mohallā Plate leads to the hypothesis that Padmapura

was the political centre of Rudrasena II’s reigṇ 

Padmapura

After mentioning Padmapura as the place of issue, padmapurāt, the Mohallā

Plate begins the dynastic genealogy, i.e. the praśasti  of the Eastern Vākāṭaka

kings in words that are identical to Rudrasena’s Mandhal Plates up to bhavanāgadauhitrasya \(ll. 2–7\), which refers to Rudrasena I. 26 The inscription breaks off abruptly; no other plates have come forward and the single plate found in Mohallā lacks the mark of approval: dr̥ṣṭam, although space had been reserved for iṭ 27 Untill now the Mohallā Plate was either ascribed to Pravarasena II or

his son Narendrasena \(proposed by Mirashi in: CII V, 77\), or to Pr̥thivīṣeṇa I or his son Rudrasena II \(Shastri 1997, 8\), or to ‘a successor of Pravarasena II’

\(Shrimali 1987, 113 ṇ 109\). 

The discovery of Rudrasena II’s Mandhal Plates has revealed that the praśasti  of the dynasty of the Eastern Vākāṭakas was already fully developed

by Rudrasena II’s time, thus taking the edge off Mirashi’s argument \(in: CII V, 77\) that the praśasti  of the Mohallā Plate resembles that of the grants

of Pravarasena II. The wording of the praśasti  resembles indeed the one

found in Pravarasena II’s inscriptions, but it equally resembles the one of Rudrasena II’s charter̥ The box-headed palæography of the Mohallā Plate

does also not significantly differ from the Mandhal Plates of Rudrasena, nor from Pravarasena’s plates for that matter̥ 28 However, Pravarasena’s charters 23 Māṇḍhal. Plates of Vākāṭaka Rudrasena II, Year 5, Shastri & Gupta 1997, 143; Shastri 1997, 85–88.

were issued from either Nandivardhana or Pravarapura. 29

Pr̥thivīṣeṇa I, the most likely author of the Mohallā Plate according to Shastri, 30 is an unlikely candidate in my view, since it is questionable whether this king already used the medium of copperplates to record his charters 31 —at least nothing has been found—although, admittedly, he might have been the founder of Padmapura. 32

To finish our review of possible authors of the Mohallā Plate, there

is Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, the only successor of Pravarasena II of whom we have inscriptions. 

His charters were issued from, a\) the Rāmagiri \(Māṇḍhal. 

Plates of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, Year 2\), or b\) Pr̥thivīsamudra \(Māhurjharī Plates of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, Year 17\), which is unidentified, but may have been a new residence of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, or c\) the Beṇṇātaṭasthāna \(Māṇḍhal. Charter of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, Year 10\), but nowhere does this king names Padmapura.33 The Beṇṇātaṭasthāna, called a vaijayika dharmasthāna, was a place on the banks of the Wainganga, probably not far from Mandhal, and this Dharmasthāna

may have been the same as the one reported by Rudrasena in his Deotek inscriptioṇ 34 Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II was, like Rudrasena II, a Bhāgavata. 

29 Two charters of Pravarasena were issued from military camps \( vāsaka\), Tripurīvāsaka

\(Indore Plates of Pravarasena II, Year 23\), and Hiraṇyānadīvāsaka \(Wadgāon Plates of

Pravarasena II, Year 25\). One, the Tirod

.ī Plates of Pravarasena II, was issued from

what most likely was a holy place: Naratta ˙

ngavāristhāna \(CII V, 49 f.\). Pravarasena

may have made an offering for the salvation of his mother Prabhāvatī at this tīrtha. I

take the fact that only the ‘increase of merit of mother’ \( mātr̥ puṇyopacayārtham, CII V, 

50 l. 16\) is mentioned, not that of his father, not as an indication that she was still alive, as does Mirashi in CII V, 49, but, on the contrary, as an indication that she might have recently passed away \(c. ad 444\). This interpretation is suggested not only by the name, which connects the \(holy\) place with water, but especially by the day on which the grant was made: the twelfth of the dark fortnight of the month Māgha, i.e. S

. aṭtilādvādaśī, 

a day particularly suitable for a sesame and piṇḍa  offering to the ancestors \(Kane V, 

434\). In the same 23rd year of his reign, Pravarasena II had invaded Gupta territory, as we know from the charter that was issued from the military camp at Tripurī, and it is unlikely that he had done so when his mother was still alive \(cf. Bakker 1997, 25\). 

30 Shastri 1997, 6–9. 

31 For the earliest Sanskrit copperplates, which belong to the second half of the 4th century, see Salomon 1998, 114. To the evidence mentioned there should be added the Copper Plate Hoard from Bagh: Ramesh & Tewari 1990. The oldest inscription in this hoard dates from year 47, presumably Gupta Era, i.e. ad 367. The oldest known copperplate grant is the Pātagaṇḍigūḍem Copper Plate of the Ikṣvāku king Ehavala Cāntamūla \(late

3rd century ad\), for which see Falk 1999–2000, 275 ff. Use and spread of copperplate charters under Gupta rule is discussed by Willis 2009, 81 f. The Vākāṭaka copperplate

grant of Vindhyaśakti II \(Year 37\) of the Vatsagulma Branch \(CII V, 93–100\), might be slightly earlier than, or contemporaneous with Rudrasena’s Mandhal Plates, i.e. c. ad 400.

Hans Bakker

On account of the above considerations it is our best guess to ascribe the unfinished Mohallā Plate to the same Rudrasena II who issued the Mandhal Plates, Year 5. However, instead of mentioning Padmapura as the place of issue, as one might have expected on the basis of this hypothesis, these Mandhal Plates specify the god ‘Mondasvāmin’ as the issuing agency. 

Yet, there is

archaeological and historical evidence that makes it plausible that this authority relates to a Viṣṇu temple in the Mandhal area, that is, arguably, in the vicinity of Padmapura, as we will see below. 

Muṇḍasvāmin

In his Mandhal Plates Rudrasena II styled himself as someone ‘whose rule is based on the cakra, the emblem of the Bhagavat’, 35 i.e. Viṣṇu; in other words, just like his father-in-law Candragupta, Rudrasena professed to be a bhāgavata. 

The Vākāṭaka kings before and after him, with the exception of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II, were all devotees of Maheśvara \(Śiva\), i.e. they were Māheśvaras, so it

seems that his conversion to Bhagavatism had been part of an antenuptial contracṭ And there is more in this inscription, which may be dated to c. ad 400, that links up with Candragupta, who, at about this time, was engaged in his grand Udayagiri projecṭ The opening of the Mandhal inscription runs as follows:

Success\! Approved. By order of Lord Muṇḍasvāmin, God of gods, who holds the conch, discus and sword; after He had made the Nāga king stretch out on

the waters of the ocean, He has entered a state of yogic sleep, while lying on the serpent coils of that \(king\) Ananta \(the Infinite One\)—a bundle of expanded hoods bending \(over Him by way of canopy\). 36

times in the sense of a temple or place of worship’; it refers to a ‘court of justice’, whereas vaijayika \(victorious\) is to be taken as ‘an honorific’. The location of Padmapura, like that of the Victorious Dharmasthāna, is unknown \(cf. above, ṇ 65 on p. 141\). A plausible conjecture, however, identifies the town with the ancient Sātavāhana site of Paunī in the

Bhandara District on the right bank of the Wainganga; Paunī ← Prakit pa¨

¸

prasādopārjitaśrīsamudayasya \(CII V, 12 ll. 13–14\)—not merely because, as Shastri observes, this is ‘grammatically more acceptable’, but also because Pravarasena, who had again embraced the Śaiva faith of his ancestors, thought it politically more acceptable; for as a Māheśvara he could not officially declare that the rule of his father, or of his House for that matter, was based \( pratiṣṭhita\) on Viṣṇu’s cakra. For similar reasons Rudrasena II may have left out the religious affiliation of his father̥

The reading of the first lines of the first plate are difficult due to severe damage. 

The editors Shastri & Gupta read in the middle of line 2: mondasvāminas◦; in

the published photograph of Plate 1, I can read ◦ svāminas◦, but the reading

‘ monda’ is impossible to confirm. 

The word monda  gives apparently little

sense. Dental and cerebral nd  are identical but for their top part, in which the square head-mark is replaced by two short curved strokes. Assuming that the reading moṇḍa  is correct, we could think of Prakrit influence by which ˇ

o

replaced u  before a double consonant without much change of pronuncatioṇ 37

If moṇḍa  is not the correct reading—the upper and lower part of the akṣara  are illegible—one could think of reading mau  instead of mo, the difference between mo  and mau  being only that the right top stroke is making an upward curve rather than being a horizontal curve. Or, more likely perhaps mu, in which the straight stroke down forming the short syllable u  has become erased. I tentatively conjecture the reading muṇḍasvāminas◦, but mo\( au\) ṇḍasvāminas◦

cannot be excluded either̥ 

The image described is that of the great Nārāyaṇa relief in Udayagiri. But

who is this Monda- or Muṇḍasvāmin who gave the instruction \( saṁdeśa\)? Cer-

tainly this refers to Viṣṇu–Nārāyaṇa, but it remains unclear whether it signifies a local deity \(i.e. image\) installed in a temple in Mandhal or Padmapura. The editors of the inscription do not come forward with a satisfactory explanation of this name. 38 I would like to suggest that the first part of the name muṇḍa

As Isaacson and I have shown elsewhere, the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple In-

scription on the Rāmagiri mentions the princess that was wedded to Rudrasena by the name of ‘Muṇḍā’—‘a younger daughter who resembled the lustre of the moon’, 39 the same lady who, from her own inscriptions, came to be known as the ‘Lustrous One’, Prabhāvatī. This queen may have used the name Muṇḍā

as long as her husband was still alive and may then have changed it into the dynastic ‘Prabhāvatī Guptā’, after she had assumed power in Vidarbha as the

regentess of her minor sons in about ad 405.40 Muṇḍa- or Moṇḍasvāmin, and even Mauṇḍasvāmin may thus be taken to mean ‘Lord of Muṇḍā’, ‘Muṇḍā’s 37 Von Hinüber 2001, 121.

more likely, however, that the toponyms preserve the ancient name of the temple than that the temple-name derived from these toponyms.

Lord’, that is the ‘God of Prabhāvatī’. As far as I am aware, this would be the

first attestation of the practice to name the installed deity after a founder who was still alive \( svanāmnā\). 41

The aim of Rudrasena’s Mandhal inscription is not the installation of this deity, but rather the donation by the king of four villages in the eastern division of Padmapura District to a pair of settlements \( adhivāsadvaya\) of the

Sātvata caraṇa \(branch/school\), which came from Vatsagulma, the capital of the Western Vākāṭakaṣ42 This is the earliest attestation of royal support of a Bhāgavata organisation named Sātvata, a religious sect known, for in-

conjecture that the name refers to the tribal background of the princess, the Muṇḍas, 

in which case these Muṇḍas must have been part of the Nāga confederation mentioned

in Prabhāvatī’s inscriptions; the Muṇḍas are known, for instance, from MBh 3.48.21

\(present at Yudhiṣṭhira’s consecration\), MBh 6.52.9b \(App.\), MBh 7.95.20 and VāP

45.123. Cf. Muruṇḍa-devī/svāminī, mother of the Uccakalpa king Śarvanātha \(CII III

\(1888\), 127, 131\), a queen obviously named after the Muruṇḍa people from which she

came; this people is mentioned among the ‘foreign countries’ in Samudragupta’s Allahabad Pillar Inscription \(CII III \(1888\), 8\). We possess no epigraphical corroboration of the existence of the Muṇḍas, however̥ 

Another explanation for the name Muṇḍā could be: the girl was bald \( muṇḍa\), i.e. 

suffered from alopecia. Her bald head may have resembled the lustre of the full mooṇ 

Lüders 1961 classified the name Muṇḍa \(Prakrit: Muḍa\), which is found as the name of

a donor on a railing at Bharhut \(A 102 \(827\)\), in the category of ‘names derived from the appearance of the body’ \(CII II.2 \(1998\), pp. 53, 6\). That the name Muṇḍa could

be a brahmin name \(Prabhāvatī belonged to the Dhāraṇa gotra\) is proven by the Grant

of Svāmidāsa, Year 67 in the copper-plate hoard from Bagh, which has preserved the name of a donee, Muṇḍa, a brahmin belonging to the Śāṇḍilya gotra \(Ramesh & Tewari

1990, 65\).

The shortening of the feminine suffixes ā  and ī  to a  and i  is permitted by P. 6.3.36. This naming practice created a legal fiction, individualizing the god so that he could be endowed with property and authority \(cf. Sanderson 2003–04, ṇ 250\). For naming deities after the donors see also Willis 2009, 139. The two li ˙

stance, from Mahābhārata 12.332.13–18 and the Tusām Rock Inscriptioṇ 43

The Sātvatas worshipped Vāsudeva and the four other members of the Vr̥ṣṇi

clan; they originated from western India. 44 The invocation of the god of his wife strongly suggests that Rudrasena was acting on her behalf: the queen hid-ing herself behind the god Mu\(o/au\)ṇḍasvāmin at whose command the grant was made. The heuristic principle cherchez la femme  has again proven its value. 

The Mandhal inscription thus seems to prove that the Vākāṭaka queen \(née

Gupta\) followed in her father’s footsteps by favouring religious organisations and building temples. She may have been the major source of inspiration of her husband and have brought the Sātvata ritual experts from Vatsagulma to

the Padmapura District in order to serve in her new temple. 

Archaeological excavations in Mandhal have brought to light three temples, the most prominent of which stood on top of a hillock named Boṁgī Huḍkī

\(BHK II\); this temple was built on a massive platform \(11.70 × 14.70 m\), with a garbhagr̥ha  and maṇḍapa. The platform was partly built into the surface of the rock, which was levelled by 32 layers of brick at the southern side. 45 At the foot of this hillock excavations revealed another building \(BHK I\); underneath its brick floor a dozen of Hindu sculptures were found, among which two or three images of the Sātvata deities: Vāsudeva, Saṁkarṣaṇa, and \(pos-

sibly\) Sāmba \( āditya\). 46 Whether or not this Vāsudeva image represented the

Muṇḍasvāmin is impossible to say. The fact that, next to these three Vaiṣṇava images, five stylistically very similar images of markedly Śaiva nature were discovered, 47 testifies to the apparently harmonious way by which the Bhāgavatas

and Māheśvaras existed side by side, tapping the same royal source of subsistence. 

Rāmagiri

Rudrasena died young. His sudden death may account for the fact that the Mohallā Plate remained unfinished. His Gupta queen assumed power, officially as regentess of her minor sons. Her Poona Plates, dated in the 13th year of the yuvarāja  Divākarasena, i.e. around ad 418, show that momentous decisions had been taken since the Mandhal foundations. 48 The dowager queen had her residence moved northwards, to Nandivardhana at the foot of the Rāmagiri, 

which hill she was developing into a state sanctuary that could match her father’s Udayagiri. Again a hilltop was chosen; two minor caves were excavated 43 CII III \(1888\), 269–271; Willis 2009, 223 ff.

on its slope, but the main Bhāgavata sanctuaries were stone temples on the

top, five of which survive till today. 

The Poona Plates convey the impression that Prabhāvatī was personally in-

volved in promoting the cause of the Bhāgavata religioṇ The charter was issued

on the 12th of the bright half of Kārttika, after breaking the fast of Prabodhinī

Ekādaśī, Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa’s awakening from his cosmic sleep \(earlier referred to in Rudrasena’s Mandhal Plates\). This festival of cosmogonic re-awakening had an important political dimension, as has been shown by Michael Willis in the case of Candragupta and Udayagiri, 49 a case that must have been very well known to the queeṇ Styling herself as entirely devoted to the Bhagavat \( atyantabhagavadbhaktā\), at this occasion she bestowed land upon another bha-gavadbhakta, the ācārya  Canālasvāmin, who may have been one of the priests

employed in the waking rite and who may have been the queen’s own teacher̥ 50

The grant was first ritually offered \( nivedya\) to the bhagavadpādamūla, the feet

of the Lord. As we learn from Prabhāvatī’s r̥ iddhapur Plates, which mention

the pādamūla  of the Lord of the Rāmagiri \( rāmagirisvāmin\), 51 this may be

taken to refer to the main sanctuary on top of the Rāmagiri. 52 The paral-

lel with Udayagiri can even be extended further, since the oldest image that survives on the hill is that of the Boar, Varāha, lifting the world \(Bhūdevī\)

on his tusk out of the cosmic ocean \(Plate 11\). That the idea was taken over but not slavishly copied, appears from the fact that the Rāmagiri Varāha is

theriomorphic instead of half man half boar̥ 53

At Nagardhan and environs, the area identified with Prabhāvatī’s residence

Nandivardhana, \(fragmentary\) images have been found of Viṣṇu, but also of Gaṇeśa and the goddess Mahiṣāsuramardinī, whereas the discovery of a hoard of three splendid Buddhist bronzes along with three prabhāvalis, a parasol, a bell

and an incense-burner at Hamlapuri, a village near Nagardhan, testifies to the presence of the Buddhist Saṅgha close by the court of the Vākāṭaka queeṇ54

Within this court Prabhāvatī’s three sons grew up, but of only the youngest

of them, Pravarasena, we possess records. These show that the prince had returned to the faith of his ancestors, since he called himself entirely devoted to Maheśvara. 55

Mansar

For several years Bhāgavatas and Māheśvaras were living together in the Nandi-

vardhana residence, but somewhere between the eleventh and sixteenth years in the reign of Pravarasena, the latter had decided that he should construct his own residence, Pravarapura, and his own state sanctuary, Pravareśvara, both named after the king himself. 56 For these two building projects wonderful sites were found, which mirrored, as it were, the old residence and the Rāmagiri:

The Pravareśvara complex was erected five kilometers to the west, on a hill again \(Hiḍimbā ṭekḍī\), facing the Rāmagiri, whereas at its foot the residence Pravarapura arose. Excavations at these two sites near the village of Mansar \(MNS 3 and 2\) during the last ten years have brought to light a wealth of material, which has been the subject of a symposium in the British Museum in 2008. 57

The personal seals—both, of Pravarasena and Prabhāvatī—found in MNS 2

\(Plates 49 & 50\), 58 suggest that the Vākāṭaka king stayed close to his mother

and that she, at an advanced age, remained a powerful figure behind the scenes, also in the new palace of her youngest son, which was her third and last residence since she had left the Gupta court of her youth—Padmapura, Nandivardhana, Pravarapura. 59 When the Gupta-Nāga princess, the queen mother

of the Vākāṭakas, eventually died in her early seventies in c. ad 444, a funeral monument \( eḍūka\) was erected, as I have argued elsewhere, at a location in between the Rāmagiri and Pravarapura, a monument that was appropriately guarded by a Nāga. 60

In the present context it may suffice to evaluate the recent discoveries at Mansar in as far as they throw light on the theme of this essay, royal patronage, religious tolerance, and the formation of Gupta-Vākāṭaka culture. 

The magnificent state sanctuary \( devakulasthāna\) Pravareśvara, erected on

the Hiḍimbā ṭekḍī near the village of Mansar \(MNS 3\), served as the place where the ceremony of issuing royal charters was performed, as attested by the Pāṇḍurn

. ā Plates of Pravarasena II, Year 29 \(ad 441\).61 A generous land-donation was granted to a group of Vājasaneya brahmins, and the same in-

scription records that one of the donees \(Somārya\) received some more land

later, after a ceremonial offering of sesamum \( tilavācanaka\), i.e. a śrāddha  rit-

ual, had been performed in that same Dharmasthāna. 62 The king’s largesse

towards his subjects was immortalized in the benign smile of the main Śiva image of this temple \(Plate 113\), the god who bestowed life on his devotees by extending a right hand filled with flowers to them, in a gesture of benevolence \( varadamudrā\). 63

probably a ceremonial place in a town \( pura\) on the banks of the Wainganga. Shastri

& Kawadkar 2001, 143 think it might be the same as Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II’s Beṇṇātaṭasthāna, the Sthāna on the banks of the Beṇn

. ā or Vainyā River, which again may be the same

as the Dharmasthāna erected by Rudrasena II \(see above, p. 325\) in or near Padmapura on the Wainganga. Did Prabhāvatī go back to the place where she, as newlywed queen, stayed with her husband Rudrasena for a donative function?

Conclusion

In the four decades following Candragupta’s inauguration of his Udayagiri monument at the turn of the 5th century, \(1\) his daughter \(Muṇḍā/Prabhāvatī\) founded a sanctuary, dedicated to Muṇḍasvāmin, in Mandhal, probably on the Boṁgī Huḍkī, whereafter the dowager queen began the building of a series of sanctuaries on the Rāmagiri among which the state sanctuary of Rāmagiri-

svāmin, and \(2\) his grandson Pravarasena II erected his own state sanctuary Pravareśvara, on a hilltop near the village of Mansar̥ Yet, as is the case in the Gupta kingdom, we have hardly any charters of foundation regarding these royal sanctuaries by these monarchs themselves. 64

Nevertheless it is fair to say that the policy of religious patronage initiated by Candragupta and his court was vigorously followed by the rulers in the Eastern Vākāṭaka kingdom. The following facts bear witness to it: 1\) sanctuaries bore the names of their royal founders, Muṇḍasvāmin and Pravareśvara; 2\) they were alternatively dedicated to either the Bhagavat or Maheśvara; 3\) they served as hallowed places for making large donations to various religious group-ings \(Sātvatas and Vājasaneyins\), mostly in the form of land grants. 65 And later, a similar policy was practised by the Dharmamahārājas of the West-

ern Vākāṭaka branch in Vatsagulma, in whose kingdom we find the famous Buddhist cave monuments of Ajanta. However, here too we witness the same curious phenomenon: a lack of charters of foundation issued by the reigning king Hariṣeṇa himself. 

Although the kings showed clearly their religious orientation, we have no evidence whatsoever that could point to great enmity between the religious organisations, despite the fact that rivalry for patronage as well as clients no doubt played a role. The first four decades of the fifth century, dominated by the rule of Candra- and Kumāragupta in the north and Prabhāvatī Guptā and

Pravarasena in the south, may be counted among the most stable and peaceful periods in ancient Indian history. It is this stability established by good policy and tolerance that created the conditions for an unprecedented development of the imagination, reflected in the literary and visual arts, achieving a perfection that still impresses today. 

The iconographic programme developed on the Udayagiri mountain was only partly taken over in the Vākāṭaka kingdom: images of Viṣṇu, Varāha, 

Narasiṁha, Gaṇeśa, and Mahiṣāsuramardinī are found at both locations, all nearly in the classical form that would remain normative for the centuries to 64 We possess a deed of foundation of Skandagupta, viz. his Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscrip-

tion, in which the Gupta king records his installation of the deity Kumārasvāmin \(see

Bakker 2005, 249; below, p. 375; cf. Willis 2009, 144 ff.\). And we possess a document of Prabhāvatī’s daughter Atibhāvatī \(name uncertain\), viz. the Kevala–Narasiṁha Tem-

ple Inscription, which records the installation of Prabhāvatisvāmin \(Isaacson & Bakker

1993, 54; Bakker 1997, 30–33; above, p. 124; below, p. 354\).

come. However, in Vidarbha this sophisticated artistic tradition blended with a local form of craftsmanship which lent to it its peculiar, somewhat rustic flavour and which gave rise to creative experiments that were not all equally successful. The sculptures found in Mandhal are a good example of this. But in the course of a few years since the Mandhal inception, the classical images on the Rāmagiri of Varāha, Trivikrama, and Narasiṁha were created in the ma-

ture Vākāṭaka idiom, which matched their Udayagiri counterparts in artistic quality and refinemenṭ 

The workshop set up by Prabhāvatī for the production of high quality, 

red-sandstone sculptures continued to work under her son and reached an unequalled level of sophistication and originality in the sculptures that once adorned the Pravareśvara Temple. Although the research of these sculptures is still in its infancy and their iconography is still little understood, it may be observed that their appeal lies in their tranquility, which expresses mood and emotional state \( bhāva\)  rather than action \( vikrama\), sentiment and emotion \( rasa\) rather than force \( bala\), and as such they are characteristic of the best that Indian art has produced.
