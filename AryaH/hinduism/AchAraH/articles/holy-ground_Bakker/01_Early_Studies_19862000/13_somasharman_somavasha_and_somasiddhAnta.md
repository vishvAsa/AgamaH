A Pāśupata tradition in seventh-century Dakṣiṇa Kosala∗

Studies in the Skandapurāṇa III

Harāya Namaḥ 

The first fruit of Minoru Hara’s life-task-project to clarify the early history of the Śaiva religion appeared in the Indo-Iranian Journal of 1958 under the title Nakulīśa–Pāśupata–Darśanam. This was followed by the submission of his dissertation, Materials for the study of Pāśupata Śaivism, to the Department of

Sanskrit and Indian Studies of Harvard University in 1966 \(Hara 1967\). Ever since, Hara has contributed to the research into the history of the Pāśupata

religion by a continuous series of meticulous studies. 1 Thanks to these studies our knowledge of this enigmatic but fascinating branch of early Hinduism has significantly increased. Paucity of sources, however, has inevitably hampered our understanding of the process of origin and spread of this religious movemenṭ Hara, like other scholars before him, duly recognized that the puranic text corpus contains numerous references to the Pāśupata religioṇ Yet, due to

inconsistencies of all sorts and uncertainty as to their exact dates, he considered, rightly, the use of these texts for historic purposes a hazardous affair and consequently assigned them to the periphery of historical research. That is to say, for the time being, since, 

Some day in the future, when all Purāṇic texts are critically edited and the inter-

relationships among them established, they may help us in tracing the history of Pāśupata Śaivism. \(Hara 1967, 12 f.\)

This day is, after thirty-four years, still far off. Critical editions of some Purāṇa

texts have indeed been prepared since, by the All-India Kashiraj Trust in Ramnagar, the Oriental Institute in Vadodara \(Viṣṇupurāṇa\), and the Institute of

Learning and Research in Ahmedabad \(Bhāgavatapurāṇa\), but they have not

really brought the progress in Purāṇa studies that one should wish. Partly this

is due to the unwieldiness of the puranic text corpus, partly to the fact that no old manuscript material has been used for these editions. How valuable ancient manuscripts are for gaining insight in the puranic text tradition itself and for the assessment of these texts as historical sources may be shown by the original Skandapurāṇa \(SP\), the edition of which is a long-term project of the Institute of Indian Studies in Groningeṇ Because the oldest manuscript of this text is dated ad 810, we can be certain that the information it contains dates from the eighth century or earlier̥ But even in this particular case the use of the Purāṇa text as a source of historical information remains a venturesome undertaking. Its historical value is greatly enhanced, however, when it proves possible to relate its data to other historical sources such as inscriptions. It is a matter of good fortune that this turns out to be the case in chapter 167 of the original Skandapurāṇa, a chapter—transmitted in two old Nepalese manu-

scripts, among which the one dated in ad 810—which deals with the traditional history and holy places of the Pāśupata and which is, as we will show, partly

in agreement with epigraphical evidence of the seventh century. In this tribute to Hara I intend to make a modest contribution to the objective envisaged by the great Japanese scholar, viz. ‘tracing the history of Pāśupata Śaivism’. 

Śaiva cosmology

The cosmology developed in mainstream early tantric Saivism distinguishes between the Pure \( śuddhādhvan\) and the Impure Universe \( aśuddhādhvan\). 

Both universes are hierarchically structured; the different levels of reality or domains are called tattva. A standard hierarchy counts thirty-one domains in the Impure Universe and five domains in the Pure one. 2 The domain that forms the trait-d’union between both universes is the Māyātattva. According to the

Svacchandatantra, this reality can be divided into two layers \( puṭa\), which are separated by a knot or barrier \( granthi\). 3 Each layer comprises six ‘worlds’

\( bhuvana\) that are reigned over by altogether twelve Rudras. The barrier or granthi  seems actually to be the border between both universes and may be considered a layer or madhyapuṭa  by itself \(SvT 10.1122–1131\). 

2 See e.g. Davis 1991, 45. The canonical list of 36 tattvas  is, as has been demonstrated by Goodall 1998, li–lv, in fact a consensus only reached ‘in the post-scriptural Śaiva Siddhānta of the commentators’ \( ibid.  lii\). 

3 The Svacchanda is a Bhairava \(Mantrapīṭha\) Tantra and does not belong to the tradition

of the Śaiva Siddhānta, though it seems to be quite close to this tradition \(Sanderson 1988, 669 f.\). The granthi  is not a universally shared feature of the Śaiva cosmos \(no mention of it is made in the Mr̥gendratantra, for instance\).

The first Rudra on our side of the barrier is Gopati and the Rudra reigning the lowest ‘world’ of the sub-barrier layer of the Māyātattva is Gahana. 4

Directly underneath him spreads the ‘net of bonds’ \( pāśajāla\), 5 the created

world that emerges from the Māyā Reality, assuming material form through

the tattvas  including those known from the Sāṁkhya system. The first Rudra on

yonder side of the barrier is Kṣemeśa, followed by Brahmasvāmin; the principal Rudra of the Māyā Reality is Ananta. 6 The Svacchanda and its commentator seem to be confused as to whether the supra-barrier layer of the Māyā Reality

still pertains to the Impure or to the Pure Universe \(SvT 10.1129–31\); the Niśvāsamukha, however, considers it still all part of the aśuddhādhvan \(4.121–

25\). 7 In the middle, according to the Svacchanda, that is on the barrier itself, at the very top of the Impure Universe, reigns the bountiful lord Ananta, the Master of the World \( bhagavān ananteśo jagatpatiḥ \), who creates at will, is

omniscient, maker of all, and dedicated to meting out confinement and grace \(SvT 10.1127–28\). Commenting on this passage Kṣemarāja observes that the Mataṅgaśāstra situates Vigraheśāna in this madhyapuṭa, who is surrounded by

eight Rudras: Śarva, Bhava, Ugra, Bhīma, Bhasman, Antaka, Dundubhi, and Śrīvatsa. 8 The Niśvāsamukha places Vigraheśa immediately above Gahana. 9

In the Pure Universe, above the reality \( tattva\) of Śuddhavidyā \(Vāgīśvarī\)

are, according to the Svacchanda, the worlds of the eight Rudras who are 4 SvT 10.1124. Cf. Mata ˙

nga 1.8.86–89. 

5 Niśvāsamukha 4.119–123 \(Kafle 2015, 190 f.\). This text is part of the Niśvāsatattvasaṁ-

hitā \(NiTS\) corpus. A critical edition of the Mukha has been prepared by Nirajan Kafle and has been defended as part of his thesis in Leiden on 15 October 2015. I refer to this thesis, which eventually will appear in the Early Tantra Series published in Pondichéry.

6 SvT 10.1125–26. Cf. Mata ˙

nga 1.8.79–81. 

7 In Niśvāsamukha Paṭala 4 the text deals with the Atimārga. My treatment of this intricate subject in the original publication of 2000 was based on a letter by Alexis Sanderson \(Oxford\) to the author \(21–7–’97\), in which he generously placed at my disposal a preliminary edition of a portion of this text with an elaborate apparatus of testimonia. Since then much progress has been made in the edition and study of the Niśvāsatattvasaṁhitā corpus, and a critical edition of the three oldest Sūtras of this

corpus—the Mūla, Uttara, and Naya—made by Dominic Goodall and others \(including Alexis Sanderson\), was published in Pondichéry in 2015. For further details I refer to the Prolegomena of this editioṇ For an assessment see Bakker 2018. See also Kafle 2015

form a maṇḍala  of the size of a thumb, the first one of them being Mahādeva. Mata ˙

incarnated in the eight Pramāṇa texts of the Pāśupata: Pa˜ncārtha etc.10

Though none of these texts has come to light so far, we have a glimpse of the Pañcārthapramāṇa, as this text is quoted by Kṣemarāja ad  Svacchanda

1.41–43. This fragment establishes that also the prime Pramāṇa of the Lākula

division of the Pāśupata \(see below\)—in contrast with the system known from the Pāśupatasūtra and its commentary—acknowledges the ascending hierarchy of Rudra worlds; these are classified into three categories, namely aghora, ghora, and ghoraghoratara. Here we meet the very same Rudras again: ‘Those Rudras who have been mentioned, beginning with Gopati and ending with Gahana, they, however, are designated ‘terrible’ \( ghora\); they live in various worldṣ’ 11

With regard to the fourth of these Pramāṇa texts, the Hr̥daya, Kṣemarāja

makes an interesting remark. From this text six other Pramāṇa texts have

been extracted that deal with ritual acts \( kriyā\) and in this respect differ

from the other eight Pramāṇas, which deal with knowledge \( j˜nāna\).12 These ritual Pramāṇas are said to have been revealed by a pupil of Laku\(leśa\), Musulendra. 13

This brings Kṣemarāja to the difference between two divisions within the Pāśupata movement \(referred to as ‘Tantra’\), namely between the Pāśupata

proper, founded by Lakuleśa, and hence designated ‘Lākula’, and the Mausula, 

founded by the eponymous pupil of Lakuleśa, Musula or Musulendra. These Mausulas, though Pāśupatas in the wider sense—after all they too stem from Lakuleśa—are put on a lower scale by the Svacchanda and its commentator̥ 

Whereas the observance of the Mausulas leads them finally to the Māyā Reality

\(SvT 11.71cd\), the Pāśupatas who base themselves on the eight Pramāṇas and

belong to the Lākula division reach the Īśvara Reality in the Pure Universe \(SvT 10.1169cd–70ab, 11.71ab\). 

The Pāśupata movement

The differences between the various traditions that form the Pāśupata move-

ment become more clear from the treatment \(in Svacchanda Paṭala 11\) of the ascending hierarchy of highest stations \( para\(ma\)ṁpadam\) that can be reached

10 The eight Pramāṇa texts are: Pañcārtha, Guhya, Rudrā ˙

nkuśa, Hr̥daya, Lakṣaṇa, Vyūha, 

ākarṣa, ādarśa. Kṣemarāja ad  SvT 10.1134: ete rudrā etannāmakapāśupataśāstrāvatārakāḥ \(SvT II, 275\). 

11 Pañcārthapramāṇa:

proktā gopatipūrvā ye rudrās tu gahanāntagāḥ | te tu ghorāḥ 

samākhyātā nānābhuvanavāsinaḥ  k \(SvT I, 16\). 

12 One wonders whether these ritual acts are subsumed under the six forms of worship specified in the Pāśupatasūtra \(PS\) 1.8: laughter, song, dance, bellowing, mak-

ing obeisance, and muttering \(PS 1.8: hasitagītanr̥ ttaḍuṁḍuṁkāranamaskārajapyopa-

hāreṇopatiṣṭhet |\). 

13 The names of these texts are given as \(SvT II, 275\): Purakalpa, Kanaka, Śālā, Niruttara, 

Viśva, Prapañca. They are no longer extanṭ

by the followers of the various sects. 14 The Mausula is here grouped together with the Kāruka, 15 of which Kṣemarāja only notes that it has been founded by someone else, descended in the place Kārohaṇa.16 The followers of both sects, 

whose observances \( vrata\) deal with a multitude of rituals, reach the worlds of the Rudras Kṣemeśa and Brahmasvāmin, whom the Svacchanda \(10.1125\) had situated on yonder side of the barrier \( granthi\), though still in the Māyā

Reality. 17

Within the Lākula division the Svacchanda seems to distinguish between the Vaimalas and those who follow the eight Pramāṇas, more specifically the

Pañcārtha, according to Kṣemarāja; both reach the Īśvara Reality, but the former’s highest station is the world of the Rudra Tejeśa, while of the latter it is that of Dhruveśa. 18 The Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta II, 

Year 61 \(i.e. ad 380/81, or ad 388, according to Falk 2004, 173\) reports that a tradition of preceptors \( guru\) whose names end in vimala  and who may have hence belonged to the Vaimala division, were affiliated to a lineage of teachers \( ācārya\) that traced its origin back to Kuśika, supposedly the first disciple of Lakulīśa. The sacred memory of these gurus  was kept alive in a ‘preceptor’s shrine’ \( gurvāyatana\), where cult objects were installed bearing their names \(Upamiteśvara and Kapileśvara\), objects which were to be worshipped by the Māheśvaras. 19

The Vaimalas may therefore have adhered to the Pāśupata

school that followed the Pañcārtha doctrine as laid down in the Pāśupatasūtra

\(see below, p. 295\). Finally, the Svacchanda specifies a group within the Lākula

division that practises the observance of the skull \( kapālavrata\). This group

14 A similar hierarchy, though unfortunately without the allocation of the Pāśupata sects

by name, is given by Rāmakan

. ṭha in his sub-commentary \( upanyāsa\) of the \(lost\) partial

commentary on the Raurava by Sadyojyotis, the Sarvāgamaprāmāṇya, reconstructed by

Goodall 1998, xxii–xxv. 

15 SvT 11.71cd quoted by Jayaratha ad  Tantrāloka 1.34 \(I, 70\): mausule kāruke caiva

māyātattvaṁprakīrtitam  k 11.71cd k

16 Who this founder is does not become clear̥ He might be ‘Karuka’ whose name evidently connects him, in the view of Kṣemarāja, with the place of his descent, Kārohaṇa. Bhandarkar 1913, 121 identifies this sect with the Kālāmukha \(Kālānana\) and conjectures

that ‘the word Kāruka is probably a corruption of Kauruṣya, the name of the third of the four \(according to the Purāṇas\) pupils of Lakulīśa, or this last name may be the Sanskritised form of the original Kāruka’. Cf. Pathak 1960, 10. Lorenzen 1991, 84 rejects this identificatioṇ Cf. below, ṇ 3 on p. 527. 

17 Kṣemarāja ad  SvT 11.71cd:

śrīlakuleśaśiṣyeṇa musulendreṇa kārohaṇasthānāvatīrṇena cāpareṇa māyātattvagata-kṣemeśabrahmasvāmiprāptihetukriyābahulāh. sve sve śāstre vrataviśeṣā uktā iti māyātattvam eva tatra paramaṁpadam |

Cf. above, ṇ 15 on p. 287. 

18 SvT 11.72. Kṣemarāja \(II, 328\):

Cf. SvT 10.1174ab, where Tejeśa and Dhruveśa are both said to be the highest station for the followers of the Pramāṇas \(see below, ṇ 20 on p. 288\).

seems to coincide with or to encompass the Vaimala, though Kse

. marāja’s com-

mentary does not make this very clear̥ 20 So far as to the Lākula divisioṇ 

The question now arises: who is this disciple of Lakuleśa, Musulendra or Musula, who initiated a sect designated ‘Mausula’? Evidently we are here concerned with a group within the Pāśupata movement that was chiefly en-

gaged in ritual \(worship\) activity, forsaking the more rigorous portion of the Pāśupata praxis. As such it might be a group that stood between the lay Māheśvaras \( laukikas\) and the tough ascetics with their transgressive practices. Unfortunately, none of the Pramāṇa texts ascribed by Kṣemarāja to this

school has survived and little more information about the sect is known from the later Śaiva Siddhānta, which, in view of its ritualistic orientation, in a way may be conceived of as its successor \(see below, p. 296\). However, the alleged dependence of the Mausula text corpus on the Lākula Pramāṇas seems to allow

the inference that this sect also ackowledged the hierarchy of Rudra worlds and as such deviated from the Pañcārtha school. 

20 Kṣemarāja ad  Svacchanda 11.73–74ab:

vaimalapramāṇaśāstraniṣṭho hi:

dīkṣājñānaviśuddhātmā dehāntaṁyāva caryayā |

ityādipāśupataśāstracodanātaḥ :

For, he who follows the Pramāṇa Śāstra and the Vaimala, 

His soul is purified by initiation and knowledge, by \(keeping to\) the prescribed praxis until death, while abiding by the Kapāla observance—he goes to that station

that is his owṇ \[SvT 11.73\]

The quarter-verse ‘His soul is purified by initiation and knowledge’ indicates the difference here from the afore-mentioned Mausulas and Kārukas, who are devoted only

to observances that are chiefly ritualistic. ‘His own \(station\)’, that is to say the afore-mentioned Tejeśa or Dhruveśa; this has been stated above: Tejeśa and Dhruveśa are the highest station \(for those who follow\) the Pramāṇas. 

\[SvT 10.1174\]

But those, \(issuing\) from the afore-mentioned Lākula stream, who practise the ob-

servances of bones like the skull \( kapāla\), on account of injunctions in the Pāśupata

Śāstra such as ‘One should lie in ashes’ \[PS 1.3\], 

They, devoted to japa, ashes, and ritual, proceed to the station of ¯

Iśvara.

The epigraphical evidence from Malhar

The antiquity of a tradition that traced its origin back to a certain Mugalisa who was initiated by Lakulīśa is secured by an inscription of which the text has recently become available. I refer to the Malhar Plates of Mahāśivagupta, Year

57 \(c. ad 650\), actually found in Junvānī \(near Malhar\) and hence also known as The Junvānī Copperplate Inscription of Mahāśivagupta, Year 57, 21 which

was published by G.L. Raykwar and Rahul Kumar Singh in Purātan \(Vol. 9

\(1994\), 146 f.\). 22

I take ‘Mugalisa’ to be a variant or prakritism of Mudgalīśa or Musalīśa, both names meaning ‘Club-bearing Lord’. Musalīśa again may be a variant of Musaleśa/Musuleśa and, having the same meaning, it might not seem too far-fetched to identify the ‘Musulendra’ of Kṣemarāja with the ‘Mugalisa’ of the inscriptioṇ 23

I present here my edition of 2000, which gave a Sanskrit text that was slightly emended according to its intended reading. Since then, however, I have reconsidered this edition and proposed some alterations in Bakker 2014, 143 f. These are presented in the notes. 

Before discussing this inscription any further, I give the text of that portion of it that is relevant for the present study. This portion starts with the last word on the first plate \(second side\), line 8, and ends in line 23 on the second plate, second side. 

21 For the early chronology of Dakṣiṇa Kosala, the Pāṇḍuvaṁśa dynasty of Śrīpura and

the reign of Mahāśivagupta \(c. ad 590–650\) see Bakker 1994b; above, pp. 235 ff. 

22 My edition of this inscription in Bakker 2000 was based, in addition to Raykwar and Singh’s edition of 1994, on a draft of a new edition by Ajay Mitra Shastri \(Nagpur\), which was published in 2001 \(cf. Shastri 1995 II, 380 f.\). Since then the original edition of Raykwar & Singh has been republished in Raykwar & Singh 2005, 188–192. The inscription was again edited by Susmita Majumdar in 2007. This set of three plates of copper is presently in the collection of Shri Raghunandan Prasad Pandeya \(Raykwar & Singh 2005, 188; Majumdar 2007, 285\). Shastri, unlike Raykwar and Singh, worked from photographs. Majumdar saw the plates herself and made use of photographs provided by Rahul Kumar Singh \(Majumdar 2007, 293 ṇ 1\). The text starts on the verso side of the first plate and comprises altogether 40 lines. 

23 I consider musula/ mausula  to be a variant of musala/ mausala. Cf. Rāmakan

. ṭha’s intro-

duction to Mata ˙

nga 1.1.1 \(p. 2\) reading: lākulamausalādibhyaḥ . That we are concerned

with an ancient historic tradition seems to be confirmed by grafitti found in the caves at Padaṇa Hill \(Bombay\), reading: sadhamusala \( siddhamusala\), and twice musaladatta. 

See Indraji 1881–82; Bakker 1991, 23; Bisschop 2006, 47. The site has been destroyed by building developments.

descended. He was born in the family of a brahmin named Somaśarman; after having been initiated by him \(i.e. Somaśarman\) in the Great Vow he became a moon on earth. 25

And he again \(i.e. Lakulīśanātha\) initiated Mugalisa. 

Then, in due succession of the lineage that started with Soma \(‘the Moon’\), the afore-mentioned Bhīmasoma—the pupil of the illustrious Tejasoma and grand-pupil of the illustrious guru  Rudrasoma 26 —has been \(justly\) raised to the position responsible for the protection of the tapovana  attached to the Bāleśvara-bhaṭṭāraka \(Temple\), which has been erected by ourselves. The donation is made to meet the expenses of ceremonies, initiations, teaching and housing of pupils and grand-pupils and to restore the shrines that have fallen into decay and are in need of repair̥ 

Interpretation

The inscription is of paramount importance for more than one reasoṇ One of them is that, in addition to the lineage of preceptors, it gives doctrinal arguments to legitimize the claims of the recipient Bhīmasoma. These doctrinal arguments should be compared with what we know of Pāśupata theology. In

order to follow the paraṁparā  of teachers back to Śiva himself, the text refers first to the latter’s eight forms that are designated ‘Vigraheśvaras’. As we have seen above, Vigraheśvara is, according to one tradition, 27 the name of the deity who stands at the apex of our cosmos, in the granthi, where it borders on the Pure Universe. There he is surrounded by eight Rudras, four of whom bear names that mark the Aṣṭamūrti according to Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 6.2–3. Just 25 Having reconsidered the issue, I have accepted the reading of the epigraph in my 2014

publication, against the emendation accepted in Bakker 2000 \(reproduced here\). This has led to a new interpretation in Bakker 2014, 144:

Consecrated by the Great Vow \(Mahāvrata\), He \(i.e. Lakulīśanātha\) became a ‘Moon

on Earth’ \(Jagadindu\). By Him again Mugalisa \[was initiated\]. 

26 If we follow Majumdar’s emendation we should translate: ‘the illustrious Sthānaguru

Rudrasoma’. 

27 This seems to be the tradition of the Śaiva Siddhānta as represented by the Niśvāsa-

mukha and the Mata ˙

nga \(see above p. 285\).

like Rudra, the \(grand\)son of Prajāpati, through his eight forms, is the actual

manifestation of God in the created cosmos, sometimes represented as the divine child, 28 so, it seems, is Śiva in his eightfold form of Vigraheśvara \(‘the Lord of Form’\) considered the fountain-head of our universe in the theology underlying the inscription at issue. Then the inscription mentions Gahaneśa \(‘the Lord of the Abyss’\), the Rudra who rules the lowest world of the Māyā

Reality in the sub-barrier layer, directly above the ‘abyss’ or ‘net of bonds’, the material world. He is said to roam about in sixty-six embodiments in successive yugas  and Lakulīśa is just the last of these incarnations in the present Kaliyuga. 

In a letter already mentioned \(see above, ṇ 7 on p. 285\) Professor Alexis Sanderson brought an unpublished text to my notice, the Jayadrathayāmala

\(JRY\), which belongs to the \(later\) Bhairava scriptures of Agamic Saivism. 

Sanderson kindly placed at my disposal a portion of the edition he made of this text \(4.449–460\), based on a ms in the National Archives in Kathmandu.29

He drew my attention to the fact that this text describes the sixty-six embodiments as ‘the Bhavas who reside in the sixty-six Māna \(i.e. Pramāṇa\)

\[worlds\]’. 30 These embodiments or manifestations are divided into two lines of gurus \( gurupaṅktis\), a set of twenty-eight Śivas and one of thirty-eight Rudras, which are associated with different levels of Śaiva teaching. The first set, which begins with Śveta and of which the last two gurus are Someśa and Lakulīśa, is said to bestow both exegesis of the scriptures and, occasionally, initiation, following the division of the Pramāṇaj˜nāna.31 The second line of thirty-eight

Rudras, which begins with Vareśvara and ends with Vaṣaṭkāra, is said to be authorized to granting initiation and is described as propounding the teachings of Bhairava. 32 It may be that the Pāśupata ascetic Udbhavarāśi, who is known

28 See Bakker 1996, 9 ff., above, p. 197. Cf. the Śrīpūrvaśāstra \(5.28-29\), referred to by

Kṣemarāja \(see above, ṇ 8 on p. 285\), which assigns eight deities \( īśvarāṣṭa\) to this reality, forming a maṇḍala  of the size of a thumb and headed by Mahādeva, the first of

the Aṣṭamūrti.

13 / Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta

293

from an inscription from the Gandharveśa Temple in Sirpur \(Śrīpura\) \(c. ad 600\), claimed to belong to this lineage, since he is explicitly called a Rudra \(see below, p. 532\). 

There can be little doubt that the inscription at issue in mentioning the sixty-six Rudra manifestations descending from Gahaneśa, ‘who roam about in successive yugas  to bestow grace \(initiation\)’, refers to the doctrine mentioned in the Jayadrathayāmala. This is again reinforced by the fact that the last two of the twenty-eight Śiva manifestations, Someśa and Lakulīśa also figure prominently in the inscriptioṇ 33 To Someśa or Somaśarman, as he is called in the inscription, we will return below. 

Lakulīśanātha, unlike Somaśarman, is explicitly said in the inscription to be an avatāra  and through him the lineage of the donee Bhīmasoma is directly connected with the divine \(Rudra\) paraṁparā: Gahaneśa, Vigraheśvara, Śiva. 

Bhīmasoma’s lineage, namely, is said to stem from Lakulīśa through the latter’s pupil Mugalisa, who was initiated by the ‘Moon on Earth’, Lakulīśa, and whom we have identified with Musula or Musulendra, the founder of the Mausula secṭ 

If this identification is right, the conclusion would be natural that the lineage of Bhīmasoma belonged to the sect of the Mausulas, who, as we have seen, probably acknowledged the theology of an hierarchy of Rudra worlds, which plays such an important role in the inscriptioṇ 

Somaśarman and the Somasiddhānta

Here, however, we encounter a difficulty. Though Bhīmasoma and his predecessors no doubt belonged to the Pāśupata fold, the designation ‘Mausula’ does

not occur in the inscriptioṇ With the Mausulas these ācāryas  may have in

common, it would seem, that they were engaged with ceremonies \( kriyā\) and

worship rather than with ascetic practices, though they were in charge of the tapovana  attached to the Bāleśvara-bhaṭṭāraka Temple in Śrīpura. But how

do we explain that their names end in soma? On account of these names I have argued \(Bakker 2000a, 1159\) that these ācāryas  probably belonged to the

Pāśupata sect known as Somasiddhānta, a sect that hardly, if at all, features in

Agamic literature where it is concerned with the Atimārga, but which in later

sources is often equated with the Kāpālikas. 34 Pāśupata ascetics whose names

33 From this evidence we may infer that a distinct Bhairava tradition within Saivism was acknowledged by the middle of the 7th century; it would seem, however, that Bhīmasoma did not himself belong to this tradition, since he affiliates himself to the first lineage of

‘Śivas’. 

34 In the play Prabodhacandrodaya by Kr̥ṣṇamiśra \(c. ad 1050–1100\), the doctrine of the Somasiddhānta is identified with that of the Kāpālikas \(Handiqui 1965, 640–645\). Fur-

ther see Lorenzen 1991, 82 ff., 215 ff.; Pathak 1960, 25. Alexis Sanderson pointed out to me that the Kapālin Satyasoma and his companion Devasomā feature in the Matta-

vilāsaprahasana of the Pallava king Mahendravikramavarman \(cf. Lorenzen 1991, 53\). 



294

Hans Bakker

end in soma  are known from several inscriptions in which they are said to be engaged in the Mahāvrata, the observance in which, according to the Malhar inscription, Lakulīśa was initiated. 35 Consequently, another question arises: who was Somaśarman? 

The

name

Somaśarman

was

already

known

from

the

Vāyu◦

and

Liṅgapurāṇas and he is evidently the same as the Someśa named in the Jayadrathayāmala as Lakulīśa’s predecessor \(see above, p. 293\). 

These

Purāṇas describe him as the 27th incarnation of Śiva, born in Prabhāsatīrtha, a holy place in Saurashtra near the Arabian Sea, famous for its Somanātha

Temple, an assignment that makes the impression of being secondary. 36 The legend told in the Malhar Plates, however, is apparently somewhat differenṭ 

It says that Lakulīśanātha was born in the brahmin family of Somaśarman, 

who therefore may have been a senior contemporary of his. Moreover, Lakulīśa is said to have been initiated by this Somaśarman in the Mahāvrata and so

became the ‘Moon on Earth’. 37

Somaśarman and his family \( kula\) thus appear, in the religious imagination of the believer, to have been the House \( śarman\) from which the Moon \( soma\)

rose over the world \( jagadindu\). The play of words may allude to ‘Soma’ as a name of Śiva and the transfiguration undergone by Lakulīśa in the initiation ritual, which, when he underwent the anointment with ashes, made him shine like the mooṇ 

The evidence of the Skandapurāṇa

The tradition recorded in the inscription seems also to have been known to the author\(s\) of the original Skandapurāṇa \(SP\). This text, too, places

35 Alexis Sanderson kindly provided me with the following informatioṇ The Indargarh Pāśupata stone inscription of ad 710–11 was engraved by a Mahāvratin with the name

Cāmuṇḍasoma \(Journal of the Bihar Research Society 1955, 249–261\). A Mahāvratin

Somibhaṭṭāraka/ Sobadeva of the Kolanupākā inscription of ad 1050 is described as proficient in expounding the Somasiddhānta \(Select Epigraphs of Andhra Padesh No.4\). 

Two inscriptions of the time of the Cola king Rājādhirāja II \(Nos. 403 of 1896 and

206 of 1912 of the Madras Epigraphical Collection\), mention a Somasiddhāntin, though

‘soma’ is not affixed to his name: Vāgīśabhaṭṭa \(EI XXVII \(1947–48\), 297 f.\). The

predecessors of this and other priests associated with the Tiruvorriyur Temple, ‘five hundred Brâhmaṇa Mahˆ

avratins’, were, according to the account of the Sthalapurāṇa, 

‘brought from the banks of the Ganges’ \(EI XXVII, 300 ṇ 1\). See also Bakker 2014, 149 f. for ◦Soma priests belonging to the Muṇḍa–Śr̥ṅkhalika Pāśupatas serving at the

Paśupatinātha Temple in Nepal. 

36 VāP 23.214–217; LiP 1.24.120–124. Another feature that makes the impression of being secondary is that Akṣapāda \(=Gautama?\), Kumāra \(or Kaṇāda\), Ulūka and Vatsa are

mentioned as his pupils. Dviveda 1982 remarks about him: ‘Prabhāsatīrtham āsādya

somaśarmā prādurbhūtaḥ | nāsti pāṭhāntaram atra | .’

37 By accepting the reading mahāvratena  in l. 17 instead of the conjecture mahāvrate tena, 

our interpretation \(Bakker 2014\) has significantly changed. I now think that the inscription tells us most likely that Lakulīśanātha became a ‘Moon on Earth’ thanks to his

commitment to the Mahāvrata. 



13 / Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta

295

Somaśarman in the Kali Age and he and his family are said to have been the first ones blessed with Lakulīśa’s grace; the text apparently implies that the latter was born in Somaśarman’s, i.e., Atri’s House. 

The spot

where the incarnation took place is called Kārohaṇa.38 The relevant passage

reads:

And God, the Lord of the gods, who is possessed of supreme sovereignty, after having assumed a white-bodied form \(i.e. a body like that of the moon\), went to the auspicious House of Atri, \(that is to say, he went to the house of a man\) named Somaśarman, who was born in the lineage of Atri. That lord, i.e. Śaṁkara, 

blessed/initiated that brahman-knowing brahmin belonging to Atri’s lineage together with his \(whole\) family by bestowing upon him perfection in yoga. Thereupon, after he had initiated this excellent brahmin and his family, O Vyāsa, God

went to Ujjayanī \(Ujjain\) and entered the cremation ground. 

There the bull-

bannered God took a bath in ashes, took a torch in his left hand and sat down \(in meditation\). 39

In Ujjain the God-man accepted Kauśika as his first disciple, 40 and then this

‘white-bodied’ or moon-like incarnation went to Jambūmārga, Mathurā and

Kanyakubja, where he initiated Gārgya, Mitra and a fourth person who is only

said to have been born in a good gotra  in the Country of the Kurus, whose name may have become Kauruṣ\(y\)a \(SPS 167.122–123\). Then the Lord, here named Lāguḍi, taught them his own doctrine \( svasiddhānta\), known as ‘Pa˜ncārtha’, which, as the Skandapurāṇa suggests, was different from the doctrine of his senior, the blessed Somaśarmaṇ 41 I take this as an indication that the author\(s\) of the Skandapurāṇa belonged to circles that were closer to the Lākula than to

the Mausula divisioṇ

Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta

When we return to the Junvānī inscription and combine its evidence with that

of the Skandapurāṇa, we may say that there evidently was a tradition within the Pāśupata fold that recognized a, what we may call ‘Pāśupata milieu’ be-

fore the appearance of Lakulīśa. 

Somaśarman belonged to this milieu. 

In

the Pāñcārthika-Pāśupata context he was mostly either ignored, or relegated to a previous yuga  by being promoted to an avatāra  of Śiva himself. Both

our sources, however, the inscription and the Skandapurāṇa, emphasize that, 

though they recognize Somaśarman as a patriarch, Somaśarman is not an incarnation, and he or his tradition derived legitimacy only from the belief that Lakulīśa was born in or resorted to his House. According to the Skandapurāṇa, 

Somaśarman himself was favoured with initiation by Lakulīśa, according to the inscription it was the other way round, 42 but, the inscription adds, the lineage of Bhīmasoma, received its ‘certificate of divinity’ through Mugalisa, who was initiated by the incarnated Śiva himself. 

The combined evidence of both sources thus seems to suggest that there existed an early Śaiva tradition that, on the one hand, recognized the uniqueness of Lakulīśa’s incarnation, but that, on the other hand, distanced itself from the Pāñcārthika and Lākula divisions. In its initial stage this tradition, or one strand of it, may have been named after its putative preceptor: ‘Mausula’. In the course of time other groups may have been assimilated, and gradually a distinct theology and praxis may have been developed, which became known as the Somasiddhānta, thus preserving a reference to a distant saint who was hallowed as its founder, Somaśarmaṇ Part of this tradition, again, may eventually have merged with groups that produced the Bhairava texts such as the Jayadrathayāmala, that is to say, became indistinguishable from the Kāpālikas. 43

Others may have joined the Śaiva Siddhānta, of which a maṭhikā  was attached

to the very same temple complex of Bāleśvara-bhaṭṭāraka in Śrīpura.44

42 This clause is no longer valid according my 2014 interpretation; above, p. 290. 

43 Sanderson 1988, 668. 

44 A hoard of nine copperplate grants of Mahāśivagupta Bālārjuna was found in Sirpur

\(Shastri 1995 II, 376–379; see also Shastri 1992a and Shastri 2001\). These nine charters have been edited and published by Rahul Kumar Singh in Raykwar & Singh 2005, 196–217. It appears that in this Sirpur hoard there are altogether seven charters that record grants made to Śaiva ācāryas  said to issue from Nandapura, but who were living in this maṭhikā  in Śrīpura. The lineage of these ācāryas  should therefore been seen

as a subbranch of the Nandapur one; it can be reconstructed from these grants: 1\)

śaivācārya  Aghoraśiva, 2\) bhagavatpāda  Dīrghaśiva, 3\) bhagavatpāda  Vyāpaśiva, and 4\)

sthānaguru  Astraśiva. All the donations were made to meet the expenses on repairs, daily worship and musical performances. 

From these inscriptions and the names of

the Śaiva ācāryas  ending in śiva  it becomes clear that the Śaiva Siddhānta was firmly

established in Dakṣiṇa Kosala, at least from the second half of the 6th century onwards. 

The original headquarters may have been in Nandapura, a place not properly identified, but probably an administrative division within the Pāṇḍava Kingdom. The charters of

the Sirpur hoard and their significance for our understanding of the Bāleśvara-bhaṭṭāraka

Temple complex in Sirpur have been evaluated in Bosma 2018, 75–87. 



13 / Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta

297

The Skandapurāṇa goes a step further in its mystification of the origins by affiliating Somaśarman to the lineage of Atri, the father of the Moon, that is to the Lunar Race, the Somavaṁśa. 45 There are indications that this powerful

symbolism was not lost on the rulers of Dakṣiṇa Kosala. It can hardly be coincidence that the Junvānī inscription is a charter issued by a king who

proclaims to belong to the Somavaṁśa. 46 After the theological and legendary

superstructure, the actual paraṁparā  of Bhīmasoma is said to begin with Soma, 

thus creating, possibly intentionally, a profound ambiguity: Soma who? Soma that is Śiva, Soma that is the son of Atri, the Moon, Soma that is Somaśarman, Soma that is Jagadindu \(i.e. Lakulīśanātha\), or just a preceptor named Soma

who lived long after the times of Lakulīśa and Mugalisa, but who happened to start a tradition of ascetic teachers within the Pāśupata fold? 

The intimate relationship of the royal Soma dynasty with this particular branch of Pāśupatas may thus have been endorsed by an ideology according to which both claimed descent from Soma—the dynastic one from Soma, the son of Atri, the sectarian one from the ‘Moon on Earth’ that appeared in the family of Somaśarman, that is in the House of the Mooṇ This House may therefore have been conceived by the mythmakers of the time as the joint cradle of two lineages: a worldly one culminating in Mahāśivagupta, the Somavaṁśin king

of Kosala, and a religious one headed by Bhīmasoma, an ācārya  living in the

temple complex founded and patronized by his royal counterparṭ 

45 That this tradition was not completely obliterated in later centuries, but locally survived well into the second millennium is shown by the Kāravaṇamāhātmya. This late text sings

the greatness of the Kārohaṇa tīrtha, which is unanimously identified with the village Karvan c. 30 km north of Baroda \(ḍr̥ Bhandarkar 1906–07; Lorenzen 1991, 177\). We encounter the following pedigree of Śiva’s incarnation in the fourth adhyāya  of this far

from homogeneous text, spoken by Mahādeva \(edition in Dalal 1920, 51\):
