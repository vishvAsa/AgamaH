Śiva Caturmukha

The myth of Tilottamā

In chapter 203 of the ādiparvan of the Mahābhārata we are told that, in order

to kill the Asuras Sunda and Upasunda, who could only be killed by each other, Viśvakarman, ordered by Brahmā, creates a woman of unparallelled

beauty. The Grandfather tells her to go to the two demons and to seduce them in order that they may kill one and other in their rivalry over her̥ This beauty, named Tilottamā, promises to do so and takes her leave of the gods by making a circumambulatioṇ Among those gods is Bhagavat Maheśvara, who sits to the south \(scil. of Brahmā\) with his face turned east, whereas the gods sit to

the north \(of him\) and the r̥ṣis  all around \(see below Textual Sources No. 2

\(TS 2\) v. 21\). Only Indra and Bhagavat Sthāṇu \(i.e. Maheśvara\) are able to

preserve their composure, but the latter’s excessive desire to watch her \( draṣṭu-kāmasya cātyarthaṁ\) leads to the coming forth of three more faces \( mukha\), one directed towards the south, which is possessed of curling lashes \( añcita-

pakṣmāntam\), one to the west and one to the north, the latter two not further qualified \(TS 2 vv. 22–24\). In this way Sthāṇu Mahādeva became four-faced

\( caturmukhaḥ \). Indra, on the other hand, issues forth eyes on all sides up to a thousand \(TS 2 vv. 25–26\). 

The curling eyelashes apart, the myth in this form does not yet refer to different aspects of Śiva that are represented by these faces, but his qualification of ‘Post’ \( sthāṇu\) may hint at his ithyphallic nature. That the appellation

‘Sthāṇu’ may have a phallic connotation emerges from the ambiguous and rather obscure nirukti  in MBh 7.173.92 \(TS 5 v. 92\): ‘Because he burns \(/destroys\) when standing erect, and, because his standing \(erect\) is the arising of the vital breath, and, because his phallus is always standing, therefore is he known as “Post”.’ 1

The myth of Tilottamā is taken up in the Anuśāsanaparvan, where signif-

icant iconographic features are added. An allusion to his ithyphallic nature

is absent here. Instead it is explained how Śiva assumed a quadruple form \( caturmūrtitva\), which may not be exactly equivalent to ‘a form with four heads’ \(TS 7 vv. 3–6\). 

Wherever she with beautiful teeth \(i.e. Tilottamā\) came into my vicinity, there, 

O Goddess, emerged a lovely head of mine. Wishing to watch her, I assumed a quadruple form with the help of yoga. Having become four-faced, while showing my own yoga, I exercise sovereignty \( indratva\) with my eastern face, with my northern one I sport \( ramāmi\) with you, O blameless one \(Umā\); my western face

is gentle \( saumya\) and conveys happiness to all living beings; my southern face, which has a terrifying appearance and is fierce \( raudra\), destroys the creatures. 

Translating this description into iconography, we may tentatively infer that the main head, which faces east, has the stern countenance of the yogin, that the southern face expresses the ferocious \( ugra\) aspect, that the northern face ex-

√

presses delight\(

ram\), whereas the western benevolent \( saumya\) face, which bestows happiness to the world, may have, by virtue of this function, a regal appearance, which may be symbolized by the turban \( uṣṇīṣa\), although the text does not explicitly specify this headgear̥ The Mahābhārata text seems

to assign these four aspects—asceticism \( yogin\), ferociousness \( ugra/ raudra\), benevolence \( saumya\) towards the world \(i.e. uṣṇīṣin\), and delight—to an anthropomorphic form of Śiva Maheśvara, who describes himself further as possessed of matted hair \( jaṭila\), celibate \( brahmacārin\), with the Pināka bow in his hand, and with a lustrous throat, śrīkan

. ṭha \(TS 7 vv. 7–8\). It is this quartet

of aspects that seems to underly, admittedly with some variations, the early sculptural representations of Śiva, no matter whether we are concerned with a caturmukhaliṅga \(aniconic\) or with an anthropomorphic image. This may be illustrated by some early examples. 

Images of śiva in his quadruple form

In the statue found in Bhita, datable around the beginning of the Common Era, 2 Śiva’s main characteristic, viz. his ascetic, i.e. yogin  nature, is represented by the central anthropomorphic figure, who is provided with matted locks \( jaṭila\) and penis erectus \(Plate 109\). Unlike his description in the Mahābhārata quoted above this central figure does not carry the bow Pināka, 

but rather seems to conform to devotional demands in that he carries the vessel \( kalaśa\) of amr̥ta  in his left hand, while the right hand seems to be raised in abhayamudrā. 3

This main deity is further characterized by four distinctive aspects symbolized by a ‘girdle’ of four heads around his waist, only partly in conformity with the Mahābhārata descriptioṇ 

One of the heads clearly represents

his ferocious aspect \( ugra\) and may therefore be directed towards the south, which would entail that the main central figure is facing southwesṭ 4

The head to the left of the ugra  face—

i.e. the one directed towards the east, if

the main image faces southwest—is de-

scribed by Kreisel in Die Śiva-Bildwerke der

Mathurā-Kunst as follows. 

Als einziger der Häupter ist er ohne Ohr-

und Halsschmuck dargestellṭ 

Der Haar-

ansatz ist nur als leichte Aufwölbung erkenn-

bar, das offenbar kurzgeschorene Haar liegt

ohne Zeichnung glatt am Schädel—sofern

nicht ein Kahlkopf \( muṇḍa\) gemeint isṭ Die

schmucklose Darstellung läßt auf den aske-

tischen Charakter dieses Kopfes schließen, 

allerdings in einem anderen Sinne als beim

ekstatischen Yogiṇ 5

The ‘ecstatic yogin’ differs from the ‘as-

cetic’ one, 

according to Kreisel; 

with

the latter ‘scheint der gelehrte brahmani-

sche Asket, wahrscheinlich der—nicht not-

wendig jugendliche—keusche Brahmacārin

oder Saṁnyāsin gemeint zu sein’ \( ibiḍ\). 

Kreisel and others consequently arrive at a

fivefold scheme, which is supposed to un-

derly the Bhita sculpture. 

Plate 109

However, the differentiation of the yogin

Image found in Bhita

into two forms within the context of a spa-

tial ramification fails in the Mahābhārata description and in any other early

text and it may hence be doubtful whether a fivefold scheme really informed the early sculptures. The image seems rather to express the idea of one central deity not counted as an aspect, a deity who is possessed of or shaped by four aspects, the ones specified in the Mahābhārata, of which the yogin  aspect in

the present image is symbolized by the head of the saṁnyāsin/ muṇḍin, which

is facing east in case of a southwestern orientation of the main deity. 6

4 If the main figure faces east, the ugra  head would face northeast, which is not plausible See below, p. 507. 

5 Kreisel 1986, 58. 

6 This orientation of the Bhita sculpture is based on the assumption that the ugra  head faces south. Kreisel op. ciṭ  60 f. takes as the most likely direction of the main figure the south, which entails that the four heads are facing the intermediate quarters. Kreisel explains this unusual orientation by the hypothesis, earlier proposed by J.ṇ Banerjea 1935, 36 ff., that the Bhita sculpture represents an ancestor monument \(Kreisel 1986, 55, 60\). This assumption would not be contradicted, but rather reinforced, by an orientation

Hans Bakker

The aspects represented by the remaining two heads of the Bhita sculpture, described by Kreisel as saumya  and uṣṇīṣin, agree with the two other aspects assigned to Maheśvara in the quoted Mahābhārata passage, if we are allowed

to equate the face qualified as saumya  by Kreisel with the one that in the Mahābhārata is said to sport with Umā \( ramāmi\). The relation to the quar-

ters remains problematic however; evidently the orientation of the uṣṇīṣin  and saumya  faces were not yet fixed. On the basis of the text one would expect that the head with which he sports with Umā \(said to face north\), is placed opposite

of the ugra  face \(said to face south\), which position in the Bhita sculpture, however, is occupied by the turbaned head, which, according to our interpretation of the Mahābhārata text, should face wesṭ An uṣṇīṣin  head in the western quarter is indeed found in an early caturmukhaliṅga  to which we turn now. 

The probably oldest Caturmukhaliṅga that

has been found is the Mathurā liṅga  pre-

served in the National Museum Delhi \(NM

65.172\), which according to Kreisel is dat-

able to about ad 100 \(Plate 110\).7 Its faces

in eastern, southern and western directions

conform to the Mahābhārata description in

that they express Śiva’s yogin, ugra  and uṣṇīṣin  aspects. The northern head deviates from the text as well as from the Bhita

sculpture in that it shows a shaven head

and as such may be denoted as muṇḍiṇ 

This head replaces ‘the one that sports with

Umā’ of the epic, but again we are basically

concerned with a differentiation of four as-

pects. 

Attempts to explain these earliest Śaiva

images according to a fivefold scheme should

be considered as anachronistic \(Bakker

1999\). The liṅga  or central figure itself was, Plate 110

when Śaiva theology developed, interpreted

Mathurā: Caturmukhali ˙

nga

as the ‘fifth’ \(invisible\) aspect in order to

bring the fourfold spatial arrangement into line with the non-iconographic  fivefold division known from the Taittirīya āraṇyaka \(TS 1\), which associates five

mantras, i.e. five cosmic dimensions or functions with Sadāśiva; the first word

of each mantra is explained by the commentator Sāyaṇa as the name of a face

\( vaktra\) of God \(Parameśvara\), viz. Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa, 

of the main figure to the southwest \( nairr̥ ti\). According to the Gobhilagr̥hyasūtra 4.7.41

a bali  offering to the pitr̥ s  should be made to the southwesṭ Cf. Gonda 1980, 55 f. on

‘the region of Nirr̥ti \(southwest\), the awful goddess of decay’.

and Īśāna. 8 This synthesis of a spatial and a cosmological order postdates our earliest Śaiva sculptures; it is, to the best of my knowledge, for the first time presented in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa 3.48.1–7 \(TS 16\). Consequently, there is in our view nothing remarkable \(‘auffallend’\) about the absence of the fivefold form of Śiva in the Mahābhārata as observed by Kreisel, since this form

is equally absent in the early sculptures. 9

Plate 111

Mathurā: Architrave with scene of li ˙

nga worship

What, on the other hand, is very remarkable is the comparatively little attention paid to the liṅga  as a Śaiva cult object in our early Sanskrit texts. There is ample evidence which demonstrates that aniconic Śiva worship was widespread throughout the Indian continent at the beginning of the Common Era. Not only do we have, for instance, the testimony of the unequivocally phallic representation of Śiva from Gudimallam, 10 which possibly dates from before the Common Era, but we also have an architrave from Mathurā, datable to the late

Kṣatrapa period \(middle of first century ad\), which shows a liṅga  sanctuary \(Plate 111\). 11 To this may be added the late-Kṣatrapa Caturmukhaliṅga that we have just discussed and numerous liṅgas  pertaining to the Kuṣāṇa period

&c. 12

Epigraphic sources attesting the worship of śiva

Due to this rich archaeological evidence of liṅga  worship, some other data of the early period have also been interpreted as referring to Śiva’s liṅga, such as the 8 These five aspects, known in the scriptures of the Śaiva Siddhānta as ‘the five Brahmans’, 

are conceived of as being comprised in or as being the embodiment of Sadāśiva, an idea

also reaching back to the Taittirīya āraṇyaka, which concludes the fifth formula of ¯

Iśāna

with the words sadāśivom, glossed by Sāyaṇa as sa eva sadāśiva om.

two cult objects mentioned in the Mathurā Pil-

aster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61 \(ad

380/81\), 13 named Upamiteśvara and Kapileśvara, 

which were installed in a sanctuary dedicated

to the Pāśupata masters in the guruparaṁparā

of Kuśika \(Plate 112\). 

The latter may have

been thought to be the pupil of Śiva’s Kārohaṇa

avatāra, known as Lāguḍi or Lakulīśa from the

fifth century onwards \(above, p. 287\). Probably

on account of the ending ‘ īśvara’, which later in-

deed mostly refers to a liṅga, these two objects are unanimously assumed to have been liṅgas, be it, according to ḍr̥ Bhandarkar \(followed by ḍC. 

Sircar\), liṅgas  of a very peculiar type, viz. those that contain the ‘portraits of the teachers’. 14 The

text on the pillar reads \(TS 12\):

\[. . . \]

āryoditācāryeṇa

svapuṇyāpyāyananimittam

. 

gurūn

. āṁca kīrtyartham upamiteśvarakapileśvarau

gurvāyatane guru . . . pratiṣṭhāpito \[ |\*\] 15

The illegible portion indicated by . . . provides

Plate 112

room for four, possibly five syllables of which the

Mathurā: Pilaster

second seems to have been a ligature; Bhandarkar

conjectured to read five: ◦ pratimāyutau, evidently conceived as an attributive

adjunct of upamiteśvarakapileśvarau. To me this conjecture does not appear

very plausible, for reasons of Sanskrit construction—one would expect the conjectured adjunct before and not after gurvāyatane. On the other hand, the po-

sition of guru . . .  directly before pratiṣṭhāpitau  suggests an adverbial adjunct, saying that the installation was for the benefit/to the memory of the gurus  or something like thaṭ Moreover, to my knowledge, we do not possess archaeological evidence of liṅgas  that are adorned with portraits of human teachers. 

Nor is Sircar’s speculation to the effect that, ‘the representations showed as if Upamita and Kapila were standing each with a Liṅga on the head’, more plausible, in want of any archaeological basis. 16 Apart from the names ending in

īśvara, there is no evidence that the two objects installed were actually liṅgas. 

That iconic images of Śiva were installed as main objects of worship in temples of this period may not only follow from the great number of early iconic images of Śiva \(Maheśa\) from Mathurā as described by Gerd Kreisel \(Abb. 65–

126\), it may be illustrated also by an image commissioned by a Māheśvara for

a Śaiva temple in the first half of the fifth century, viz. the image installed by 13 Kreisel 1986, Abb. 126a–b. For the figure carrying a stick \(Daṇḍapāṇi\) at the bottom

Plate 113

Mansar: Caturbhuja śiva

Candragupta’s grandson, the Vākāṭaka king Pravarasena II \(Plate 113\). This

king refers to the deity in inscriptions as ‘Pravareśvara’. 17 As I have argued elsewhere, there are reasons to assume that this beautiful, four-armed Śiva image discovered on a hillock called the Hiḍimbā ṭekḍī, 5 km due west of Ramtek Hill, in 1972, which to date embellishes the entrance hall of the National Museum in Delhi, represents this deity Pravareśvara. It may have been the main object 17 CII V, 19 l. 13: pravareśvara-ṣadviṁśakavāṭaka, and op. ciṭ  65 l. 1: pravareśvaradevakulasthāna.

of worship in the Vākāṭaka state sanctuary \( vaijayikadharmasthāna\) named after the king ‘Pravareśvaradevakulasthāna’ \(TS 13\), which was situated on

this hillock, near the present-day village of Mansar̥ 18

Though in recent years a wealth of Śaiva sculptures have come to light pertaining to the eastern Vākāṭaka kingdom, no liṅga  has been found among them. 19 The Vākāṭaka kings were brahmins and the majority of them Māheśvaras, but their apparent reserve to patronize liṅga  temples tallies with the Sanskrit texts of this period, in which liṅga  worship is only reluctantly acknowledged. 

Early Sanskrit sources of li ˙

nga worship

The Pāśupatasūtra and its commentary

First of all, the authoritative text of the Pāśupata sect itself, the Sūtras and

their commentary, do not mention liṅga  worship with a single word. On the contrary, the commentator Kauṇḍinya describes a manifestation of Śiva \( mūrti\) in iconic terms; his form \( rūpa\) is said to be characterized by the bull-banner etc.:

‘Image’ \( mūrti\): Either this \( yad etad\) form \( rūpa\) that is perceived by him who is

standing at the right side of God, his face turned north, in \(His\) proximity, a form that is characterised by the bull-banner, the lance in hand, Nandin, Mahākāla, 

erect phallus etc., or to which \( yad vā\) the laymen resorṭ 

The sanctuary is ‘of the Great God’ \( mahādevasya\). This is the answer \( iti\). There is the object to be worshipped. 20

The Mahābhārata

Though Rudra’s phallic aspect is recognized in MBh 10.17.21, 12.160.46, and 13.17.74, there are only a few passages in the Mahābhārata where liṅga  worship

as such is acknowledged, the oldest of which may be the verses in Droṇaparvan

172 and 173 \(TS 3, 4 and 5\), although these too are a matter of dispute. 

Discussing these passages Jacques Scheuer remarked, 

Hopkins considère que la fin du Droṇaparvan est une addition tardive à ce livre. 

D’ailleurs, tout ce qui se réfère au li ˙

19 Excavations in Mansar after the writing of the present article have shown me wrong. 

Although I still think that the Mansar Śiva image in the National Museum has been the main image of the temple complex unearthed at the Hiḍimbā T

contained at least six minor li ˙

20 Below, Textual Sources 10. This difficult passage deals with the concept of the Dakṣiṇā-

mūrti. It is the vision of the initiated Pāśupata at the right side of the object of worship. 

This does not preclude that the latter itself is an aniconic representation of Śiva. This will be the subject of further discussion below, pp. 516 f.

couches les plus anciennes de l’épopée. Dans une “critical note” de l’édition critique, ṣK. De rejette la “conjecture” de Hopkins: le passage n’est pas si récent qu’il ne soit attesté par les principales familles de manuscrits. Cela est indéniable. 

A notre point de vue, cependant, il est plus intéressant de remarquer que le culte du liṅga ne semble jamais intervenir dans des passages se rattachant immédiate-ment au mythe central. Qu’il suffise ici de noter ce clivage. Il serait sans doute prématuré d’en proposer une explicatioṇ La mention du culte du liṅga est relativement claire. Les relations de Kr̥ṣṇa et de Rudra le sont moins. 21

The Mahābhārata passages at issue run \(TS 3 and 4\):

Birth, karman, tapas, and yoga  of these two \(i.e. Nara and Nārāyaṇa\) and of you

\(i.e. Aśvatthāman\) are eminent; God has been adored by these two in the phallus \( li ˙

For the gods and Siddhas and great seers, by worshipping in this way, strife to attain the highest in the world and the everlasting statioṇ And this very Keśava \(Kr̥ṣṇa\) is a votary of Rudra, being born from Rudra; this Kr̥ṣṇa who is eternal is also to be worshipped with sacrifices. He who adores the Lord in the phallus, knowing Him to exist in all creatures, in him the One whose emblem is the bull \(i.e. Śiva\) takes an extraordinary delighṭ 

Because his phallus stands erect in perpetual celibacy and the people worship greatly \( mahayanti\), \(therefore\) is he known as the Great Lord \(Maheśvara\). Seers, gods, Gandharvas and Apsarases also have adored his phallus, and that one also stood erecṭ Therefore that Great Lord \(Maheśvara\) rejoices when his \(phallus\) is worshipped; Śaṁkara becomes happy and gratified and he is delighted. 

The latter text is with some minor variants found again in Anuśāsanaparvan

146.15-18 \(TS 8\), which may indicate that the Droṇaparvan passage belongs

to an older stratum of the epic. An explicatory śloka, which is also found

in the Droṇaparvan but in another context \(MBh 7.173.94; TS 5\), and which seems to echo MBh 7.172.87 and 90 \(TS 3\), has been inserted \(MBh 13.146.16\), somewhat disturbing the syntax, since the relative pronoun yo  in 16a lacks a clear antecedenṭ 22 This verse unequivocally refers to the liṅga  as a particular cult object distinct from an iconic image \( vigraha\). It says \(TS 8 v. 16\), 23

One who worships the body \(i.e. image\) of the magnanimous one \(i.e. Śiva\), or otherwise his phallus \( li ˙

nga\)—the constant worshipper of the phallus shall obtain great prosperity. 

The fourth, or, if we count the Droṇaparvan passage and its reprise in the

Anuśāsanaparvan as one, third passage advocating liṅga  worship is also found 21 Scheuer 1982, 277. 

22 This also holds true for MBh 7.173.94.

Tell me if it has been revealed to you. Whose phallus Brahmā, Viṣṇu and you too

with the gods should always adore, that one is the chiefest for that reasoṇ 

The Rāmāyaṇa

The Rāmāyaṇa confirms the impression obtained from the Mahābhārata:

though a later tradition ascribes to Rāma the foundation of the Rāmeśvara

liṅga, this is not found in the critical edition of the ādikāvya itself. 24 Liṅga

worship is only ascribed to the Rākṣasas led by Rāvaṇa \(TS 9\), who worships

with incense and fragrant flowers a golden liṅga, which he had installed on an altar of sand on the bank of the Narmadā River̥ ‘And after the worship he

sung and danced, waving and spreading his hands’ \(TS 9 v. 40\). It may be significant that in the Mahābhārata passages great emphasis is laid on the fact

that gods and other divine beings also worship Śiva’s liṅga, 25 which sounds like a sort of justification, whereas the Rāmāyaṇa confines liṅga  worship to

Rākṣasas in a tone of scarcely concealed dismay. 

Concluding observations

The overall impression that we may gather from the material surveyed is that, during the first centuries of the Common Era, the brahmanical elite, whether priest, king or renouncer, preferred to venerate Maheśvara in iconic form and frowned upon liṅga  worship. 26 Its gradual acceptance in the 5th and 6th centuries by those circles that earlier rejected it may be illustrated again by the myth of Tilottamā. 

The evidence of the Skandapurāṇa

This myth recurs in what we think is the original Skandapurāṇa, which we

date in the sixth or seventh century, and which may have been composed in Pāśupata circles. 27 Here explicit reference is made to Śiva in his liṅga  form \(TS 14\): ‘There arose amidst these celestials a liṅga, solid, massive, a bundle of tejas  as it were.’ From this liṅga  four faces emerged when Tilottamā made her

circumambulation, the eastern one lustrous, with lips gracious as the bimba 24 Eck 1991, 62 f.

fruit \( prasannabimbauṣṭha\) and with three eyes \( tryakṣa\) \(TS 15 vv. 16–17\); the southern one ‘possessed of the colour of a languid cloud laden with water, having a ferocious voice, with dreadful teeth shining \(in an open mouth\), and the corners of the eyes bloodshot and glittering’ \(v. 19\); the western face was perfect \( anuttama\) having three eyes, and the northern one was very full \( susaṁpūrṇa\) and very gracious \( suprasanna\) \(vv. 21–24\). Thus runs the oldest description of the Caturmukhaliṅga in the Sanskrit literature known to me, at least half a millennium after the Indian sculptors had begun to materialize the idea in stone \(see also below, p. 521\). 

Conclusions

The various sources surveyed above lead to the following conclusions. 

1 The historic reality of ancient Śiva worship, which is taken here as a specimen of a wider issue, cannot be reconstructed by relying on one type of source only. If we would base ourselves on texts alone, we would hardly be aware that liṅga  worship was practised on a large scale throughout the Subcontinent during the first centuries of the Common Era. If, on the other hand, we would not have texts, we would be at a loss how to interprete the phallic stones provided with four heads of different countenances. 

2 When the visual material is interpreted with the help of written sources it is of paramount importance that both sources date from about the same time. More often than not art-historians describe their visual material on the basis of textual material that dates from half a millennium later, such as when early sculptures are explained by having recourse to the iconographic treatise of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa or still later texts, while, as we have seen, contemporaneous descriptions are sometimes to be found in, for instance, the Mahābhārata. 

3 The incongruity that is frequently found between the archaeological material and textual descriptions may have its root in the different sections of the society to which these sources pertaiṇ This makes us realize how tentative our assessments are and how little we actually know about the early history of the religions of India. 

4 If these three conclusions are accepted it follows finally that, in view of the scarcity of sources at our disposal, we simply cannot afford to disregard any of them. When, however, we evaluate them and try to construe an integral picture of the past, we should never lose sight of their innate differences and we must proceed with the utmost caution, in the knowledge that the complexity of the historic reality of ancient India is far greater than we can ever hope to recover̥
