Imagination, Imagery, and Image in Vedic and Śaiva Initiation Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, 

Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom

prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 

Matthew 25: 34 \(cf. Ecclesiastes 10: 2\)

Introduction

The transformation of the Vedic religion into new systems of belief and practice, early Hinduism for short, is a process of cultural change that, despite two centuries of research, has only partly been understood. The replacement of the sacrificial fire by images of wood and stone is among the most obvious innovations. As has been convincingly argued by Phyllis Granoff \(2006\), this innovation was only reluctantly accepted in some circles of brahmanic orthodoxy. 

On the other hand, there can be little doubt that Vedic imagination informed the concept of God and His image \( mūrti\) in the newly emerging religions. It

found expression in the Sanskrit texts of early Hinduism. The confrontation of this textual evidence with the material images of the archaeologist is often perplexing, however̥ 

An example of such a conundrum is the so-called Dakṣiṇāmūrti, mentioned in the Pāśupata texts, the Mahābhārata, and the later Śaiva literature of the

Mantramārga. In this essay, we will examine the Vedic origins of the imagery of the Dakṣiṇāmūrti. This mūrti  appears first and foremost to be an ideal image embedded in the ritual of initiatioṇ The Vedic upanayana  ceremony laid the structural foundations for the initiation rites of the later religious orders. The Dakṣiṇāmūrti appears to be a token of the theistic transformation of the Vedic imaginatioṇ It illustrates how literate Śaiva brahmins took the Hinduistic turṇ At first material images played, if at all, only a secondary role in this transformatioṇ However, in a religious world that was increasingly pervaded by material images of the divine, it was bound to happen that the visionary

image became an archetype of visual representation, the Dakṣiṇāmūrti as an iconographic category. In this process, an essential characteristic of the vision of God as revealer was reinterpreted: His right side became interpreted as His southern face. The incongruity of this representation with the age-old religious idea of the south as being terrifying, inauspicious, 1 was to make a conundrum. 

The sitting position of teacher and pupil in the Vedic Upanayana ritual

The śatapathabrāhmaṇa

The Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 11.5.4 is our earliest source for the ancient upanayana ritual; a brief summery may highlight its major features. 

1 The pupil approaches a teacher and expresses the wish for apprenticeship by saying: I have come for brahmacarya \( brahmacaryam āgām\). He commits

himself to be a brahmacāriṇ 

2 The teacher \( ācārya\) asks his name. The question implies the answer: ‘who’

\( ka\) conceived as another name of Prajāpati. 

3 The teacher takes the pupil by the hand, implying that he accepts him as a student, saying indrasya brahmacāry asy, agnir ācāryas tavāham ācāryas

tavāsāv iti. Thus the ācārya  and Agni are seen as homologous. 

4 He consigns the student to Prajāpati and Savitr̥ and to all beings in heaven

and earth. 

5 He consigns him to brahman, that is, he makes him a brahmacārin  by saying

brahmacāry asi, while he lets him sip water, which embodies the elixir of life \( amr̥ta\). Thus the pupil is initiated into the life eternal, and becomes a

‘wanderer in brahman’. 

6 After this initiation—with or without delay \(see below ṇ 11 on p. 508\)—the

ācārya  teaches the Veda by making him repeat its quintessence, the Sāvitrī. 

The importance attached to the position of pupil and teacher during the Veda instruction is apparent from the fact that it is singled out for specification in the Brāhmaṇa; there appear to be two different traditions. According to one tradition the student sits or stands at the right side \( dakṣiṇatas\) of the teacher, who, as is understood, is facing easṭ The position of the pupil is characterised by the term bulva/bulba. This word, apparently a hapax legomenon, is given by Mayrhofer ewa ṣv. as ‘etwa “seitwärts”’ \(with the remark: ‘nicht klar’\). 

Because of this sideway position, this tradition is rejected in the Brāhmaṇa, 

which opts for the alternative: the student should sit opposite the teacher looking at him from east to wesṭ 2

1 Cf. Bodewitz 2000, 22 f. 

2 ŚBr 11.5.4.14:



26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 507

Which direction, we may ask, faces the pupil in the situation that is rejected? 

The commentary of Sāyaṇācārya does not resolve the questioṇ3 There can be little doubt that the teacher, homologous to Agni, is facing east; 4 the student, on the other hand, may be thought to be looking at his teacher in profile, i.e. 

he may be facing north, for that is the region of the gods, 5 the region of living men as opposed to that of the deceased. 6 Or, he may face the northeast, since standing towards that direction Prajāpati created the creatures, there the gate

of heaven is believed to stand. 7 The northeast may be particularly appropriate in the present case, because it not only is the direction into which Prajāpati

issued the beings—Prajāpati to whom the student has just been consigned—

but also is the point of the compass where the Sun \(Savitr̥\) rises at the summer solstice to begin a new year, the Sun to whom the student has just as well been consigned and into whose mantra \(Sāvitrī\) he is actually being initiated, 

that is, whose mantra he is reciting. If directed to the northeast, the student is seated obliquely, not transversely, with respect to the teacher̥ It is difficult to determine whether bulva  means ‘oblique’ or ‘transverse’. 

Consequently, the first of the two alternatives discussed in the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa, the one that is rejected by the Brāhmaṇa itself, namely that the

student is sitting at the right side \( dakṣiṇatas\) of the teacher, allows for two interpretations: \(1a\) teacher is facing east and student is facing north, or \(1b\)

Now some recite \(to the pupil\) while the latter is standing or sitting at the right side \(of the teacher\). One should not do so. One would be able to say to him in that case:

‘Yes indeed, he \(the teacher\) has begotten him \(the student\) sideways, and sideways \(i.e. wayward\) he \(the student\) will be’; and so, indeed, it will come to pass. Therefore he should recite to \(the pupil\) sitting in front of him, while the former is westwards looking.

nmukho bhaviṣyatīti er I take prāṅmukham, like bulvaṁtiraścīnaṁ, as an adverb qualifying ajījanat: ‘ bulva, i.e. transversely, while facing forward/eastwards \( prā ˙

nmukham\), he has begotten \(the pupil\)’; this adverb, referring to the position of the teacher, serves to pronounce the contrast with the pupil, who will turn away \( parā ˙

nmukha\), will be adverse. Bulva  thus means transverse \( tiraścīna\), 

adverse \( parā ˙

nmukha\), which, again, suggests that teacher and pupil sit at right angles.

teacher is facing east and student is facing northeasṭ \(1b\) is clearly a variant of \(1a\) and a combination of both is perfectly feasible: the pupil faces north, but, if appropriate, may look towards the northeasṭ 8

That the Brāhmaṇa prefers alternative \(2\)—teacher and pupil sitting opposite to one another, directed to the east and west respectively—-may above all have practical reasons, since the teacher bestows more than only learning upon the neophyte at this occasion; a change of position may have been thought to be cumbersome. 9 The first alternative \(1a–b\), on the other hand, because it makes sense in terms of the mystique of the quarters, may have preserved original traits. Moreover, the right side of the teacher has symbolic meaning. 

‘There is ample evidence that the right hand or the right side of the body was decidedly preferred to the lefṭ’ 10 We will return to this below. 

The Śatapathabrāhmaṇa does itself refer to earlier modalities of the ritual recitation of the Sāvitrī, when it reads: ‘In former days, however, they recited that same verse \(the Sāvitrī\) at the end of the year \( saṁvatsare\), thinking

“being as old as a year, indeed, children are born; as soon as born, we impart speech to him”.’ 11 The appropriate direction in this ritual is, or so it seems, the northeast, in which direction Prajāpati gave birth, Prajāpati who is equated

with the year \(Gonda 1984\). 

The Gr̥hyasūtras

The two traditions indicated briefly in the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa can be followed

in the Gr̥hyasūtra literature. As one would expect, the only Gr̥hyasūtra that 8 Gonda 1980, 54 gives a confusing rendering of this position: On the other hand, the brahman \(priest\) is placed or sits south. . . . The same  position is prescribed to the boy who is to be initiated before a girdle is tied round his waist, which is to protect him against evil influences. 

The boy is not said to sit in or face the south, but to sit at the right side of the teacher̥ 

That this coincides with the south is secondary and as such does not play a symbolic role, as I will argue in this article \(cf. Bodewitz 2000, 26\). 

9 According to the Gr̥hyasūtras the pupil receives, among other things, a girdle and a staff, to which the sacred thread may be added. All three items are missing in the ŚBr accounṭ 

It seems that bestowing the yajñopavīta  upon the novice at this occasion is a relatively late addition \(see Gopal 1959, 296\). There is obviously a loss of symbolic significance in this second position of the pupil compared to the first alternative. Surveying the meaning of the western direction in Vedic ritual Gonda 1980, 55 observes: ‘It follows that facing eastwards whilst standing in the west \[as does the ācārya, H.ṭB.\] results

in a desired effect, so that in the west one can be prosperous; facing the west does not however produce resultṣ’

10 Gonda 1977a, 624; Gonda 1980, 57–60. ‘In the case of male beings the right side was auspicious, most probably because it was the ‘male’ side. Atharvavedapariśiṣṭa 70 c 25, 5 a royal sacrificer seeing that the flame of a \(sacrificial\) fire points to the right will be victorious. The side of strength and auspiciousness is also widely regarded as that of benignity, allegiance, benediction’ \( op. ciṭ  60\).

Sāyaṇa ad loc.  takes this to mean

that the teaching of the student of the Sāvitrī took place a year after the initiation \(or

after a shorter period as specified in the following paragraphs\). 



26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 509

belongs, like the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa, to the White Yajurveda, the Pāraskara-

gr̥hyasūtra, follows the accepted tradition of the Brāhmaṇa, though it mentions the alternative. The place where the teaching takes place is specified: north of the sacrificial fire. 

After \(the pupil\) has made a pradakṣiṇa  around the fire he takes his seaṭ The teacher, touched \(by the pupil\), pours oblations of ghee into the fire; when the remains have been eaten, he instructs him: ‘You are a brahmacārin, drink water, 

do your service, may you not sleep in the daytime, restrain your speech, put fuel on the fire, drink water̥’ Then he recites to him the Sāvitrī, north of the sacrificial

fire, while \(the pupil\) is sitting near him with his face turned west, looking \(at him\) and being looked aṭ Some: ‘to him while standing or sitting to his right side’. 12

The Gr̥hyasūtras of the r̥gveda, the āśvalāyana- and Śāṅkhāyanagr̥hyasūtras, 

although different in details and sequence, seem basically to follow the accepted tradition of the White Yajurveda with regard to the place of teaching, to the north of the fire, and the vis-à-vis position of teacher and pupil. 13 The same goes for the Gobhilagr̥hyasūtra of the Sāmaveda.14

13 The āśvalāyana gives the following procedure. The teacher, touched \(by the pupil\), after having poured \(oblations of ghee into the fire\), stands to the north of the fire, his face turned east; opposite of him, with his face turned west the other \( āśvGS

pupil, the teacher consigns the pupil to Savitr̥ and to Prajāpati. After this the pupil puts on fuel and touches the fire.

The other tradition, rejected in the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa, we find in some

Gr̥hyasūtras affiliated with the Black Yajurveda, though not in all.15 For an assessment of the upanayana  ritual according to this tradition, we turn to the elaborate description in the Bhāradvājagr̥hyasūtra. Its procedure may be epit-

omized \(with cross-references to the Hiraṇyakeśigr̥hyasūtra\). 

The teacher prepares for the homa  sacrifice by consecrating the implements etc. \(BhGS 1.3\). He prepares west of the sacrificial fire a seat of grass \( kūrca\), 

of which the grassblades are turned to the north. There the teacher takes his seat, his face turned to the east; the pupil \( kumāra\), who has put on the

yajñopavīta  and sipped water, takes his seat at the right side \(of his teacher\) \( dakṣiṇatas\).16

The teacher performs the homa  sacrifice \(BhGS 1.4\). Then he gives the pupil a new cloth, a girdle of muñja grass \( mauñjī mekhalā\), and a skin of the black

antelope \( ajina\) \(BhGS 1.5–6\). Next \(BhGS 1.7\) \(the teacher\) strews to the west of the sacrificial fire darbha grasses, on which the two \(teacher and pupil\) take their stand, one facing east, the other wesṭ The one facing east takes the hand of the one facing west and vice versa. A servant fills the añjalis  of both

with water̥ By his añjali \(the teacher\) transfers the water into the añjali \(of

the pupil\). 17

A formal interview takes place in which the teacher asks for the name of the pupil and subsequently leads him \( upanayāmi\) to Prajāpati \(Ka\) \(BhGS 1.7\). 

15 Not, for instance, in the āpGS 4.11.7–8:

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 511

The teacher consigns the pupil to several other deities. The teacher asks him to step on a stone \( aśman\) and to put fuel on the fire \(BhGS 1.8\). 

Then the pupil makes a pradakṣiṇa  around the fire, takes his seat at the right side \( dakṣiṇatas\), scil. of the teacher, while he turns to the north, touches \(the feet of the teacher\), and asks: ‘O lord, recite the Sāvitrī’. 18 The place where

the teacher is seated is not again specified, but presumably he is still seated west of the fire facing east, that is the place where he performed the homa sacrifice, took the interview accompanied by the añjalis, and consigned the

pupil to Prajāpati etc. This is corroborated by the Hiraṇyakeśigr̥hyasūtra.19

The sitting position of the preceptor and his audience Veda study is of course not restricted to the brahmacāriṇ Outside the village, 

retreated into the wilderness \( araṇya\), brahmins devoted themselves to study

and, if they became known for their learnedness, attracted students. In this way we conceive of the origin of the different Upaniṣad teaching traditions and of other early Indian schools of philosophy \(above, p. 230\). The subject of study and teaching may have changed accordingly, but the setting is traditional and had a long life. We find such an idyllic setting, for instance, in the Śāṅkhāyana-

gr̥hyasūtra, where it describes ‘the rules for the forest-dweller regarding his \(Veda\) study’. 20

For this study \( svādhyāya\) the forest-dwellers should go to a pure spot in the northeast that is open at the eastern side. The site is circular or marked by a circle with an entrance to the east or the north. After some preliminary rites, they may take up their studies. 21

teacher\), according to rank; if this is impossible \(i.e., if there is not enough space\) they may face all directions. They should wait for the rising of the suṇ And when they have seen it \(rise\) in all its splendour, they say: ‘Sir, recite’, while touching with their right and left hands the hallowed feet of the teacher—his right \(foot\) with their right, his left \(foot\) with their left hands. 22

The Śāṅkhāyanagr̥hyasūtra, which, as we have seen, agreed with the tradition of the White Yajurveda in opting for the face-to-face position of teacher and pupil north of the sacrificial fire in the upanayana  ritual \(see above ṇ 13 on p. 509\), reserved the alternative position, in which the student sits at the right side of the teacher facing north, for the traditional school of the hermitage. 

It is to be expected that this time-honoured traditional setting of religious education may be met again in the Mahābhārata. The practice to stand with

one’s face turned to the east when making a solemn pronouncement or to reveal a secret is attested in the great epic, as the following example may show. 

But then, when Kr̥ṣṇa, haven of brahmins, heard the cause of Pārtha’s \(i.e. Arjuna’s\) sorrow, he touched water and stood still, his face turned to the east; and the mighty lotus-eyed one spoke this word for the benefit of Pāṇḍu’s son, intent upon

killing the army of Jayadratha: ‘O Pārtha, there is a supreme unfailing weapon

called “Pāśupata”, by which god Maheśvara killed all the Daityas in battle.’ 23

However, I have not found in the Mahābhārata an exact parallel of the situation

described in the Śāṅkhāyanagr̥hyasūtra, in which the position of the audience is specified.

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 513

and Continuity in Indian Religion Jan Gonda elaborates the theme of the book with regard to the Vedic upanayana  and the initiation \( dīkṣā\) in the monastic orders. 

Instead of upanayana and the renewable dīkṣā we find in the monastic orders an ordination proper—sometimes called dīkṣā—which is to be preceded by a noviciate beginning with a ceremony which is a parallel of the upanayana, and in various Hindu sects and communities an admission to full membership, to priesthood or guruship, which is also known as dīkṣā. \(Gonda 1965, 317\) And describing the initiation ritual of ascetics, he makes the following remark. 

. . . dīkṣā.  This term is translated by ‘consecration’ and ‘renouncement of the world’. On this occasion one is inter alia  given a new name. During important acts, such as study, confession, one has to turn east- or northward; as is well known these directions are of special importance in brahmanic rites, the ‘door of heaven being in the northeast’. \(Gonda 1965, p. 385\)

We shall confine ourselves here to the Śaiva orders and investigate whether these traditional directions of teacher and student can actually be found in their early texts. 

Initiation in the Pāśupata tradition

The earliest text of a Śaiva order that we have is the Pāśupatasūtra with the

commentary of Kauṇḍinya. The initiation in the order is briefly described by Kauṇḍinya when he explains the future tense used in the first Sūtra \( vyākhyāsyāmaḥ , ‘we shall expound’\). 

‘Shall’ \( syā\) refers to the time required, namely the time that is required \(before the exposition can begin\) by the ācārya, to consecrate a brahmin at

Mahādeva’s ‘southern mūrti’ with ashes that are consecrated with the \(five\) mantras, ‘Sadyojāta’ etc., and to initiate him in the mantra, after he has made him relinquish the signs of his origin—a brahmin whose \(antecedents\) have earlier been screened, as follows from the word ‘therefore’ \( ataḥ \) in the Sūtra, who comes

\(to him\) from amongst the householders etc., and who has \(already\) engaged himself in fasting and observances. 24

The other Pāśupata text that has survived is the Gaṇakārikā. The Ratnaṭīkā, 

commenting on Gaṇakārikā 5, in which the elements of the initiation are

24 Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1 \(p. 8\):

I consider the interpretation that takes the locative mūrtau  as depending on ◦ saṁskr̥ tena, 

rather than on saṁskaroti, possible, though less likely in the present context for reasons given below \(cf., however, the T

. īkā quoted in ṇ 38 on p. 518\).

Hans Bakker

summed up—the \(right\) materials, the \(right\) time, the ritual \(of consecration\), the image \( mūrti\), and the preceptor \( guru\) 25 —explains what in the context of the consecration ritual \( saṁskāra\) is meant by mūrti. It reads:

The word image \( mūrti\) in the Kārikā aims at \( abhipretaḥ \) the spot \( bhūpradeśaḥ \)

a little to the right \( dakṣiṇa\) of that, which \[by Kauṇḍinya\], in \[his commentary on\] the ‘Sūtra on offering’ \[i.e. PS 1.8–9\], is described \( vyākhyātaṁ\) as the locus

\( sthāna\) of worship of Mahādeva that is characterized by the erect phallus etc.—a spot not separated from it by a wall \( kuḍya\) or the like. 26

‘ Mūrti’ is here to be interpreted as a location, ‘at the mūrti’, referring to the site

of consecration, said to be by the right side of \(◦ dakṣiṇa◦\), close to ◦ samīpa◦ and not separated ◦ avyavahito  from that which in Pāśupatasūtra 1.8–9 is qualified

as Mahādeva’s manifestation \( rūpa\). If we assume that the commentator of the Gaṇakārikā and Kauṇḍinya both describe the same initiation tradition, we may deduce from the T

. īkā that the words of Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1, mahādevasya dakṣiṇasyāṁmūrtau, are to be understood as saying that the novice is seated on the right side of Mahādeva. 27

Though the esoteric intention of both authors clearly hampers our understanding, I would hazard the conjecture that the guru, who initiates the student into the Pāśupata observance \( vrata\) by communicating to him the doctrine as revealed by Śiva himself in the Pāśupatasūtra, embodies Śiva. The novice is

seated next to him on his right-hand side, that is, he is situated ‘at the mūrti’; 

and this designation is understandable as it refers to a situation in which the neophyte envisages the image \( mūrti\) of the divine preceptor in his guru, that is, he sits at Mahādeva’s visual manifestation and sees Him, His rūpa, His

benign epiphany, in front of him, in profile. The two natures of the teacher, the learned and pious person of flesh and blood, and the divine archetype are explicitly stated in the T

. īkā on the word ‘ guru’. 

‘Guru’ is the preceptor \( ācārya\); he has two forms, on account of the distinction supreme and not-supreme. With regard to these \(two forms\) not-supreme is he as 25 Gaṇakārikā 5cd: dravyaṁkālaḥ kriyā mūrtir guruś caiveha pañcamaḥ .

As Harunaga Isaacson has suggested to me, we should read kuḍyādya◦, instead of kuṭyā-

I cannot subscribe to the translation of Oberhammer \(1984, viii\), which makes mūrti-

śabdena  the logical subject of vyākhyātaṁ\(‘Mit dem Wort mūrtiḥ , das im Verehrungs-

that has the actual iconographic characteristics of ūrdhvali ˙

27 To interpret the word mūrtau  here \(above, ṇ 24 on p. 513\) in conformity with the commentary on the Gaṇakārikā was first suggested to me by Dr Gérard Colas. 



26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 515

being circumscribed by the knowledge of the five categories. The supreme guru is the lord Maheśvara, who empowers the former̥ 28

If we turn to the Svacchandatantra, describing the samayadīkṣā, we find the above interpretation confirmed. 

After he has performed the \(preliminary\) rites, he \[i.e. the guru\], rejoiced at heart, makes the pupil, whose eyes are full of joy, stand up and, taking him by his hand, leads him towards the ‘southern mūrti’: Having made a circle there into a seat

\(consisting\) of the syllable om  with the help of a flower, he places the pupil upon it, his body erect, his face turned to the north. After the guru has installed himself whilst facing east, he performs the sprinkling and subsequent rites. 29

The Dakṣiṇāmūrti

From the place of initiation where Śiva manifests himself to the novice for the first time in that He assumes the form of guru, we now proceed to the public domain of the temple. In that context the word mūrti  is used to refer to the

physical object of veneratioṇ This connotation underlies the T

. īkā’s description

of the daily worship of the initiated Pāśupata, who, after his bath in ashes, 

enters slowly the sanctum. Then he falls to his knees on a spot to the right of the image \( mūrtidakṣiṇe bhūpradeśe\), makes an añjali  before his heart, and looks at

Śiva in the image as if He were there in His very person, and which means that, 

he, fully concentrated and with his head turned towards the north, practises japa with the aim of that \( viśeṣa\) detachment from the sensual world, after which japa he sinks into meditation on Śiva; only then \( eva\) he should burst into repeated boisterous laughter̥ 30

Hans Bakker

Analogous with the situation of initiation, the Pāśupata envisages Śiva in front

of him, this time, however, in the physical object of worship. It is towards this manifestation of God that the Pāśupata turns and in whom he is sunk, 

an idea we also find in the following passage of the Southern Recension of the Mahābhārata  where broad-minded Vāsudeva teaches. 

The holy man who has reached Me \(i.e. Vāsudeva\) fixes himself upon My

body \( mūrti\), or on Rudra’s Dakṣiṇ\(ā\)mūrti, especially on the fourteenth \( tithi\). He, the great ascetic, while he is venerated by Siddhas, Brahmarṣis and celestial folk, and while his praises are sung by Gandharvas and choirs of Bhūtas, he of great splendour enters either Me or Śaṁkara. 31

We thus observe that the term mūrti  in the Pāśupata context on the one hand

refers to the ‘image’ \(meaning bodily manifestation\) and, on the other hand, when used in the locative \(or when the locative is meant\), refers to ‘a particular spot near the image’, that is not to the image itself. Both meanings are, as we will argue, comprehended by the technical term dakṣiṇāmūrti, literally ‘south-ward/rightward image/body/figure’. 

This term is explained by Kauṇḍinya

when he comments on Pāśupatasūtra 1.9: mahādevasya dakṣiṇāmūrteh. |

‘Of the God’ \(◦ devasya\) is a genitive. This is a syntactic feature that expresses the relationship of owner and property; it signifies possession/ grace \( parigraha\) only. 

‘Southern’ \( dakṣiṇā◦\) in the Sūtra is in the sense of a specific point of the compass. 

The sun divides the quarters and the quarters divide the mūrti. 

‘Image’ \( mūrti\): Either this \( yad etad\) form \( rūpa\) that is perceived by him who is

standing at the right side of God, his face turned north, in \(His\) proximity, a form that is characterised by the bull-banner, the lance in hand, Nandin, Mahākāla, 

erect phallus etc., or to which \( yad vā\) the laymen resorṭ 

The sanctuary is ‘of the Great God’ \( mahādevasya\). This is the answer \( iti\). 

There is the object to be worshipped. 32

hāsaṁpunaḥ punaḥ kuryāt |

The commentator rejects the view of some \( ity eke\) who say that he may burst into boisterous laughter as soon has he got to the temple, if his detachment has not ceased \( yady anivr̥ ttapratyāhāras tadā gatamātra eva hasitaṁkuryād ity eke\).

Cf. ibid.  ll. 3067 f. dakṣiṇamūrti  here instead of dakṣiṇāmūrti  for metrical reasons. I am

grateful to Phyllis Granoff who pointed these passages out to me.

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 517

For the initiated Pāśupata like Kauṇḍinya the term dakṣiṇāmūrti  thus seems rather to refer to a situation or state than to a particular ‘image’, namely the state in which God appears to him who sits or stands at His right side and sees Him in front of him \(for instance in the temple image\). It is the situation in which Śiva reveals himself ‘towards him who is at His right side’ \( dakṣiṇā\),33

namely, by turning His auspicious, gracious side towards him who is facing north—the sitting position of the novice since Vedic times. 

The strength of this tradition obviously rests on the religious idea of the right side. To turn one’s right side upon someone is an auspicious act; in the case of God it is an act of grace in which He reveals Himself and His doctrine

‘unto them on his right hand’. It happens to the blessed ones in His proximity, that is in heaven on the Himavat, and as such to the initiated Pāśupata in his

yoga  with God, who may be represented either by the image or by the guru. In sum, the Pāśupata Dakṣiṇāmūrti is a state in which God reveals one quarter of Himself, the form to which He grants access, i.e. yoga; it is Śiva’s figure of grace. 34

In spite of the use of the word mukha, used here in figurative sense, I think the Śvetāsvatara Upaniṣad 4.21 expresses this very idea:

‘Unborn is He’, so saying, Let a man in fear approach Him: O Rudra \[show\] thy right \[auspicious\] cheek, Protect me with it ever\! 35

In the direct vision that is granted to the Pāśupata the ideal image of Mahādeva

is visualized as being accompanied by his acolytes Nandin and Mahākāla, the

33 The adverbial daks

. iṇena \(cf. MBh 1.203.21, above, p. 500\) is equivalent to dakṣin

. ā, which

is the oia instrumental in ā  preserved in some adverbs. Wackernagel 1930, III § 41b ṣv. 

dákṣiṇa: ‘ dakṣiṇā́  zur rechten Seite.’ The phrase dakṣiṇāmūrtigrahan

. āt  in his commen-

tary ad  PS 1.9 shows that Kauṇḍinya takes dakṣin

. āmūrteḥ  as a compound, altough he

does not explain iṭ However, his speaking of ‘eastern’, ‘northern’, and ‘western’ mūrtis

\(below, ṇ 34 on p. 517\) implies that he takes the compound as a Karmadhāraya. In the

gloss \(above, ṇ 32 on p. 516 f.\) he makes clear that ‘southern’ is to be understood as ‘at the right side of’ \( dakṣiṇe pārśve\). This is his explanation of the adverbial dakṣiṇā \(cf. 

below, ṇ 39 on p. 518\). 

34 In this way the daks

only one fourth of himself. r̥ V 10.90.3–4:

bull-banner etc., in short, a ‘tableau de la troupe’. 

The physical image in

the sacred compound is not defined. If our interpretation is correct, it may be any image, most often a liṅga, considered by the Pāśupata laymen as ‘the

image’ \( mūrti\) of Mahādeva, a designation that for the initiate is true only in metaphorical sense. 36

The definition of God’s figure of grace

The concept of dakṣiṇāmūrti  thus comprises the manifested form \( rūpa\) of God, the \(physical\) image or body \( mūrti\) in which it may be envisaged, and

the right side \( dakṣiṇe pārśve\), which indicates the Pāśupata’s position with respect to Mahādeva and his embodimenṭ As such the term is applicable to every situation in which the Pāśupata enters into contact with his object of

worship. And this appears to have been the intention of the author of the Pāśupatasūtra when we read PS 1.8–9 coherently \(as also the author of the T

. īkā seems to have done: upahārasūtra, above, p. 514\): ‘He should worship with

offerings of laughter, singing, dancing, bellowing, obeisance, and muttering to the figure of grace \( dakṣiṇāmūrti\) of Mahādeva.’37 The same idea underlies the Ratnaṭīkā, where it says that the Pāśupata should consecrate the ashes with mantras in the temple ‘at Śiva’s Dakṣiṇāmūrti’,38 or the Skandapurāṇa when it advises that one should offer rice pudding with ghee at the ‘southern mūrti’

during one year in order to become like Nandiṇ 39

It seems obvious that the same idea underlies the initiation rite, in which the place of the physical image, i.e. the mūrti, may be taken by the guru who

36 This position conforms best with the view of images maintained in the Nyāya school, 

which is generally believed to have had close links with the Pāśupata. In Colas 2004, 163

this author describes Udayana’s point of view as follows: ‘The rite does not specifically invest the image with a divine presence or power through a mechanical process, but occasions the conscious reflection, by deities, of themselves as being present in the image.’

In other words, Śiva’s presence in the Dakṣiṇāmūrti is an act of grace \( parigraha\).

hasitagītanr̥ ttaḍuṁḍuṁkāranamaskārajapyopahāreṇopatiṣṭhet mahādevasya

dakṣiṇāmūrteḥ  k 8–9 k

I take dakṣiṇāmūrteḥ  here as genitivus pro dativo  depending on upahāreṇa \(see Speijer 1889, § 132\). Alternatively, we may read an accusative, dakṣin

. ā-

mūrtim, in accordance with the Benares and Calcutta mss of the Sūtras and some

testimonies. See Bisschop 2006a, 5. 

38 Ratnaṭīkā at Gaṇakārikā 7 \(p. 18\): . . . śivadakṣiṇamūrtau mantraiḥ saṁskr̥ tya . . . .

When the compound dakṣiṇāmūrti  is dissolved, dakṣiṇa  is taken as an adjective—

sometimes inflected nominally \(above\), sometimes pronominally \(e.g. Kauṇḍinya ad  PS

1.1, quoted in ṇ 24 on p. 513\)—which shows again that we should read dakṣiṇāmūrti  as

a Karmadhāraya compound. However, when dissolved, the original use of the adverb dakṣiṇā́ \(= dakṣiṇena\) is ignored. 



26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 519

represents Śiva \(as the ācārya  represents Agni in the upanayana\). In fact, it appears most likely that the concept of dakṣiṇāmūrti  originated from this ritual in which Śiva as supreme teacher reveals himself. To this primordial figure—a god who is facing towards the east, but who confers his blessings, that is his ‘right’ side, on his creatures, be they gods, Siddhas, or worshippers in Bhāratavarṣa—the pseudo-Śaṁkara pays homage:

tasmai śrīgurumūrtaye nama idaṁśrīdakṣiṇāmūrtaye  k

This obeisance is to Him who has the form of the illustrious teacher, to the illustrious figure of grace. 40

The Dakṣiṇāmūrti and iconography

Having thus established the original meaning of Dakṣiṇāmūrti, we may proceed to its current iconographic denotatioṇ 

Among the earliest texts that describe the dakṣiṇāmūrti  in iconographic terms may be the two Upajāti verses that are quoted by Gopinatha Rao, which

he ascribed to the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, but which are not found in the printed text of that name. 

His right \(lower\) hand shows the \( jñāna\) mudrā and in his \(right\) upper \(hand\)

he \(holds\) a white rosary; in his left \(lower hand\) he is holding a book comprising all the āgamas and more, and with his upper \(left hand\) he holds the cup with nectar̥ 

He is seated on a white lotus, his colour is white, powerful, with white cloth and ointment, and crowned by the crescent, teaching knowledge to the sages: that is what they call his Dakṣiṇāmūrti. 41

On this and other, predominantly late South-Indian texts Rao based his description, which was repeated without any significant change by almost all later indological writing on this subjecṭ It may be significant to note, though, that in the above passage the southern orientation of the image is not mentioned. 

To substantiate his view, however, Rao wrote:

One account gives an explanation regarding the etymology of this name; it states that because Śiva was seated **facing **south when he taught the r̥ishis y¯oga  and jñāna  he came to be known as Dakshiṇāmūrti. This aspect of Śiva is always invoked by students of science and arts. 42

hymn is doubtful, see Potter 1981, 317.

Hans Bakker

Unfortunately, however, we are not informed about this ‘account’, 43 but Rao, without any doubt, was following an Indian iconographic convention, which prescribes ‘that in all Hindu temples, both Śaiva and Vaishṇava, the niche on the south wall of the central shrine should have the figure of Dakshiṇāmūrti enshrined in it’. 44 Bruce Long, who devoted an article to the subject, relied heavily on Rao, but he put his finger on the problem, when he professed that he was puzzled, 

As to why the southern direction, which is believed almost everywhere in India to be sinister and inauspicious, should in this instance be evaluated as auspicious and benigṇ 

It is not beyond reason that we explain this curiously positive evaluation of the southern direction on the basis of the same religious principle by which the Furies in Greece came to be called the ‘Eumenides’, and Rudra, the ferocious Howler, came to be addressed as Śiva, the Auspicious. Perhaps the worshippers of Śiva hoped that by having the Divine Preceptor face the southern direction, that area would, thereby, lose its sinister qualities and become benigṇ 45

Although I shall not deny that considerations such as the above may have played some role, at least in coming to terms with the apparent incongruity once established, it is important to recognize that, if they played a role, they did so in retrospecṭ The cause of the alleged incongruity, I would like to argue, is a reorientation of the traditioṇ A cult concept was transposed to iconography. 

Part of the original meaning was retained—Śiva as the source of knowledge—

part of it was reinterpreted, namely, the direction God faces when expounding His wisdom: His ‘right side’ became his ‘southern face’. The southern temple walls were consequently thought most suitable for showing images of Śiva in his role of teacher̥ 46 Thus the dakṣiṇāmūrti  entered the textbooks of Indian architecture, for instance the Mayamata, which divided Kauṇḍinya’s vision into two. 

A chacun des paliers des temples il faut disposer aux points cardinaux des \(images des\) dieux. Au rez-de-chaussée on place à l’Est les deux guardiens de la porte, Nandi et Kāla; au Sud c’est la Dakṣiṇāmūrti, à l’Ouest Acyuta ou Liṅgasambhūta et au Nord Pitāmaha. 47

43 I could not find this ‘account’ in the texts at issue presented in Rao’s Appendix B \(II.2, pp. 137–146\).

46 Harle 1986, 301:

All the principal images of the Brahmanical pantheon are represented in South India during the Col.a period. There is a particular predilection for Bhikṣāṭana, Śiva as the naked young ascetic, and for Śiva as Dakṣiṇāmūrti, the expounder of yoga, music and

the śāstras, who is always, where possible, facing south \( dakṣiṇa  means ‘south’, and although there is no very convincing explanation of the name, it may account in part for the popularity of this image in South India\).

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 521

The development of a cult concept into an iconic image Finally the question must be briefly addressed when and where this cult concept turned into an iconographic one. This development may actually have had two moments. 

1 An anthropomorphic \(iconic\) representation of Śiva who through attributes, a book for instance, a mudrā \( vitarka-, vyākhyāna-mudrā\), or some other

gesture, or because he sits alongside a pupil, is identifiable as the supreme teacher̥ This image, or at least Śiva as its main character, faces the easṭ 

2 An anthropomorphic representation of Śiva, two- or four-armed, with one or more of the attributes of \(1\), but whose main characteristic is that he is directed towards the south without showing the terrifying aspecṭ 

The transition of 1 to 2 calls forth the ‘incongruity’. 

This incongruity may be considered to have been solved when the image of the Dakṣiṇāmūrti began to evolve an autonomy of its own, next to and independent of that of Aghora/Bhairava. Given the fact that the central image in the garbhagr̥ha  is orientated towards the east, the image at the southern wall may be seen as an original ‘visualisation’ of the right side, expressing one aspect of the god enshrined, from whom it became spatially detached. Buddhist influences \(e.g. the deer at Śiva’s feet, the tree above his head\) are discernible in this process of iconographic compositioṇ 48

The genesis of the iconic representation of the teaching Śiva thus ended with his ‘banishment’ outside the cultic sphere. The idea of the guru as the locus \( sthāna\) or support of the divinity was transferred onto the central cult object in the sanctum, the liṅga. Therewith the Dakṣiṇāmūrti on the southern outer temple wall lost its original ritual setting. It became part of the iconographic programme of the Śiva temple. 

The process of transformation from cult concept into an iconic image seems to have been completed \(in South India at least\) by the tenth century \(i.e. 

the early Col.a period\), but may have started much earlier̥ An early textual testimony of this process is found in the Skandapurāṇa. 

It tells the myth

of Tilottamā that we discussed above, pp. 498 f. When the nymph bows to Śiva’s southern appearance \( dakṣiṇāṁmūrtiṁ\), the face of the guru of the

gods \( mukhaṁsuraguros\) emerged, ‘possessed of the colour of a languid cloud laden with water, having a ferocious voice, with dreadful teeth shining \(in an open mouth\), and the corners of the eyes bloodshot and glittering’ \(SP 62.18–

19\). The ‘incongruity’ is obviously not yet solved, since the description of this face suits the figure of Aghora/Bhairava, not that of the teacher or guru.

To assess the above-sketched develop-

ment properly requires an art-historical

scrutiny of the available archaeological

material examined for the above fea-

tures; this cannot be done here. Mate-

rial representing moment 2 is not hard to

find. A relatively early example dating

from the late Pallava period \(ad 875–

900\) is illustrated in Plate 114. It shows

a four armed Śiva as teacher on the outer

southern wall of the garbhagr̥ha  of the

Vīraṭṭāneśvara Temple in Tiruttaṇi. His

hands show the vitarkamudrā  combined

with rosary, abhayamudrā, book, and

lotus-stalk. 49

The question when and where exactly

this type of ‘southern image’ is found

for the first time is more difficult to es-

tablish, partly for the same reasons as

why the material representing moment

1 proves so hard to identify. It is often

difficult to establish which direction the

Plate 114

Tiruttan

teaching Śiva is facing, if the image or̥ i: Dakṣin

. āmūrti

relief is no longer part of a spatial con-

struction or has been reemployed. It may even be doubted, whether our moment 1 is an historic reality at all; possibly, the teaching Śiva, the Dakṣiṇāmūrti as an iconographic category, was from the beginning conceived of as facing the south. 

A Dakṣiṇāmūrti on a crossbar found in Nagarī

To conclude I wish to present an image that may alleviate our doubts somewhaṭ 

It concerns a crossbar found in Nagarī \(Rajasthan\) illustrated in Williams 1982, Pl. 216. On p. 140 f. this scholar gives the following descriptioṇ 

The most impressive carvings at Nagarī are the remains of a gigantic gateway or toraṇa  that must belong to the early sixth century on the basis of its relationship to works from Mandasor̥ 

The lintel has sculptures on both sides. The reliefs on what appears to be the reverse \(mistakenly said in op. ciṭ  141 to be illustrated in Pl. 216\) are identified by Williams as scenes from ‘the story of the encounter between Arjuna and the kirāta  or hunter’. After his fight with Śiva incognito, Arjuna receives the 49 Dumarçay & l’Hernault 1975, photo 54. Cf. Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture I, plate 77. For the few images classified as Dakṣiṇāmūrti found in Uttar Pradesh

Pāśupata weapon, a scene that is unfortunately missing, but may have been depicted in a relief that belonged to the part of the crossbar that has broken off and is missing. 50

Plate 115

Nagarī: Crossbar of toraṇa

About the obverse side of the lintel \(Plate 115; see also below, Plates 141–142\) Williams observes:

The subjects of the \[obverse\] of this same crossbar remain to be identified. The third panel from the right \(not the center of the lintel\) \[below, Plate 154\] shows a seated figure with twisted locks in meditation, surrounded by four worshippers; despite the lack of the club, this might represent Lakulīśa. If so, the remaining scenes are presumably Śaiva. 51

50 The end of the story may be supplied as it is told in the Mahābhārata \(see also below, 

pp. 592 ff.\). Mahādeva reveals himself and Arjuna falls to his knees MBh 3.40.55–56: tato devaṁmahādevaṁgiriśaṁśūlapāṇinam |

dadarśa phalgunas tatra saha devyā mahādyutim  k 55 k

sa jānubhyāṁmahīṁgatvā śirasā praṇipatya ca |

prasādayāmāsa haraṁpārthaḥ parapuraṁjayaḥ  k 56 k

Arjuna asks for forgiveness and receives a booṇ Arjuna asks for the terrible Pāśupata weapon

also called ‘Brahmaśiras’ \(MBh 3.41\):

bhagavan dadāsi cen mahyaṁkāmaṁprītyā vr̥ ṣadhvaja |

kāmaye divyam astraṁtad ghoraṁpāśupataṁprabho  k 7 k

yat tad brahmaśiro nāma raudraṁbhīmaparākramam |

yugānte dāruṇe prāpte kr̥ tsnaṁsaṁharate jagat  k 8 k

This is granted. Then Arjuna, purified, embraces the feet of the Lord and the latter says

‘learn’:

tac chrutvā tvaritaḥ pārthaḥ śucir bhūtvā samāhitaḥ |

upasaṁgr̥ hya viśveśam adhīṣveti ca so ’bravīt  k 17 k

Though the text omits it, we have to assume, after the above and in view of the other side of the lintel, that Arjuna takes his seat at the right side of the Lord. Then Śiva explains the secrets of the weapon:

tatas tv adhyāpayāmāsa sarahasyanivartanam |

tad astraṁpāṇḍavaśreṣṭhaṁmūrtimantam ivāntakam  k 18 k

In a letter \(e-mail ḍd. 10-3-2001\) Joanna Williams informed me that she ‘wonders whether the scene at the left end of this face \(below, Plates 145–146\) might not represent the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice’. This proposition is further pursued in the present article, but an elaborate study of the crossbar by Bakker

& Bisschop 2016 intends to show that it is untenable after all. 52

Dakṣa’s sacrifice and his instruction in the Pāśupata observance The story of Śiva’s destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice is told in Mahābhārata 12

App. I No. 28 \(= Northern Recension\); it may be briefly recapitulated here. 

Vīrabhadra and Bhadrakālī etc. destroy Dakṣa’s sacrifice in Gaṅgādvāra. 

Dakṣa takes refuge with Maheśvara \(ll. 123 ff.\). Devadeveśa himself appears \(ll. 140 ff.\). Dakṣa begs him that not all his sacrificial toil may have been in vain \(l. 151\). This is granted by Hara. Then the text reads \(ll. 154 f.\): jānubhyām avanīṁgatvā dakṣo labdhvā bhavād varam |

nāmnām aṣṭasahasreṇa stutavān vr̥ṣabhadhvajam  k Dakṣa fell to his knees, having received \(this\) boon from Bhava. 

Then he praised Vr̥ṣabhadhvaja by his Thousand-and-eight Names. 

The stotra of Śiva’s thousand-and-eight names follows \(ll. 160–389\). Śiva expresses his satisfaction and promises Dakṣa that he will gain the benefit of thousand Aśvamedha and hundred Vājapeya sacrifices, thanks to his grace

\(ll. 390–94.\). Then Mahādeva bestows upon him another boon \(ll. 395–409\):

the vrata, based on the Veda with its six aṅgas  and on the Sāṁkhya-yoga, 

arduous on account of its tapas, which is transgressive of, in some cases con-formable to the ordinary dharma, which is practised by those who are nearing the end, and which is beyond the \(ordinary four\) stages of life \( atyāśrama\). 53

Mahādeva promises him the reward of this vrata \(ll. 407–09\): mayā pāśupataṁdakṣa yogam utpāditaṁpurā |

tasya cīrṇasya tat samyak phalaṁbhavati puṣkalam |

tac cāstu te mahābhāga tvajyatāṁmānaso jvaraḥ  k 54

52 See below, pp. 567 ff. and pp. 576 ff. 

53 MBh 12 App. I No. 28 ll. 395–406:

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher

525

Long ago, O Dakṣa, the Pāśupata yoga  was created by me: that \( tat, scil. yoga\) is the eminent reward of properly practising that \( tasya, scil. vrata\), and that \( yoga\) shall be yours, O blessed one. Throw off the fever of \(your\) soul\! 

In other words: Mahādeva instructs/initiates Dakṣa in the Pāśupata observance; this is the boon that will lead him eventually to the end of suffering \( duḥ khānta\), the Pāśupata yoga  or union with God. 

In view of the material discussed in the present article, it is obvious to see in the first panel from the right on the lintel \(Plate 116; cf. Plate 156\) an example of a Dakṣiṇāmūrti. If we assume that the toraṇa  was facing east and that this is the obverse side of the lintel, Maheśvara, accompanied by his wife, 55 sits facing east, leaning towards the right, where his suppliant sits on his knees, facing north. 

This interpretation is corroborated by our later study of the crossbar̥ However, although the two panels to the left \(above, p. 524\) initially suggested that the suppliant in question might be King Dakṣa \(Bakker 2004c, 133\), there are good reasons to reconsider this interpretation and to see in the person who receives instruction, not Dakṣa, but Arjuna.56

Plate 116

Nagarī: a Dakṣiṇāmūrti

\(cf. MBh 13.17.18\). Yoga in the Pāśupata system is defined by Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1

as ‘union with god’: ucyate yogam | atra ātmeśvarasaṁyogo yogaḥ |

My interpretation

differs from that of Mertens 1998, 76 f., who assumes a conflation of concepts: ‘Im selben Satz wird das pāśupatavrata  als yoga  bezeichnet \(407\); die beiden Begriffe tapas  und yoga werden hier also synonym verwendeṭ Für bestimmte Schichten des Mahābhārata ist die

Vermischung beider Begriffe üblich.’ However, no examples from the MBh are adduced to corroborate this contentioṇ 

55 Cf. MBh ibid.  l. 410: evam uktvā mahādevaḥ sapatnīko vr̥ ṣabhadvajaḥ |

56 Bakker & Bisschop 2016, 239 f.; below, p. 586. 



526

Hans Bakker

It thus appears that the central theme of both sides of the crossbar is the acquisition of a Pāśupata good: the instruction in the Pāśupata observance

and the procurement of the Pāśupata weapoṇ The toraṇa  may have stood at

the entrance of a Pāśupata temple. The depiction of the instruction scene, the Dakṣiṇāmūrti or Śiva’s figure of grace, would therefore be appropriate, if our analysis is correcṭ
