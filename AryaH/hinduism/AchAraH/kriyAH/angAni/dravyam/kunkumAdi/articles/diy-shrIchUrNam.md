If one is interested to prepare Srichurnam on his own, here is the method to prepare it. This method of preparing Srichurnam has been carried forward for generations:

1. Take few pieces of Gundu Manjal/ Turmeric (Not Kasturi Manjal), as shown in the picture above. In this case, lets take 8 pieces of Gundu Manjal
2. One small tumbler(azhaaku) of rice. (8:1 Ratio – Manjal:Rice)
3. Soak both the Manjal and Rice in water for 8 hours
4. After 8 hours, filter out water completely
5. Start crushing it coarsely by using stone (idi kal) or by Mixie. While doing this (The consistency will be similar to preparing adhirsam maavu)
6. Powder the mixture to make it finer/smoother
7. Use a thin(melisu) Veshti/cloth and filter out the granules.
8. Again make the mixture even finer, by grinding it in mixie. Repeat step 6 and 7 until it becomes finer
9. Mix crushed ‘edible camphor’ (pachchai karpooram) with the powdered mixture.
10. If you need to prepare red Srichurnam, mix vengaram (a variety of alum) / padikaaram (alum), salt and lime.
11. Dry it in a place where there is no direct sunlight on it and transfer it into a box.

Note: For yellow Srichurnam skip step 10 and for red Srichurnam step 10 has to be followed
