My son had lead poison from yellow-srichUrNam that was store bought (sent from India). 

## Discovery
He was chewing on paint chips on a visit to India. So when we went back I got a preventive lead test done. Came positive. We thought it was the paint. They did a second test in 2-3 weeks and while the number went down, it didn't go down as much as expected. 

They reported it to the Santa Clara county health division. Became a big deal. Inspectors came home, tested entire environment. Didn't find anything. But based on experience the office told me that most likely it is the srichurnam. They found lead in multiple Indian family homes in the kumkum.

I got myself and my wife tested. I came positive (still below the threshold to open a case) while she came negative. 

## DIY shrIchUrNam
I decided to make my own srichurnam. In 6 months, my son's numbers got better.

## Alerts
If it is bright yellow it is suspect.
