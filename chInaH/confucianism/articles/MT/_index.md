## Mongol opinion
Hearing Fridman's chat with Weatherford: One of the things he mentions: The Mongols did not consider Confucianism a serious religion. IMO a good call on their part. They did not ban it or interfere with its practice and even accepted its ethics as valuable to their subject but did not treat it as a religion. Ethics alone, without a structured pathway for a religious experience, leaves most humans with a void.
