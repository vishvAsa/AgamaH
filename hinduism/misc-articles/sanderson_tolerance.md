- A classic example of missing the forest for the trees. Fact is that polytheist systems are far more tolerant of rivals than Abe's diseases. So, this is an inherent factor driving tolerance present in the Indian systems being considered.

Title: Tolerance, Exclusivity, Inclusivity, and Persecution in Indian Religion During the Early Mediaeval Period  
Author: ALEXIS SANDERSON

## Introduction
It is generally believed that already in the early mediaeval period from the fifth century of the Christian era onwards, if not earlier, there existed a single Hindu religion, embracing Vaidika orthopraxy in ac cordance with primary and secondary Vedic revelation (Śruti and Smr̥ti) together with the sectarian traditions of the worship of Viṣṇu, Śiva, Devī, and the Sun God (Sūrya), to mention only the foremost among the deities that attracted personal devotion, that is to say, those whose worship is attested not only in countless temples surviving from that period in the Indian subcontinent and much of South East Asia but also in numerous donative inscriptions and extensive bodies of prescriptive literature. It is also widely believed that this complex unity displays an exemplary degree of religious tolerance, not only between Vaidikas, Vaiṣṇavas, Śaivas, Śāktas, and Sauras, but also between these and the followers of the other two major Indian faiths of the age, namely Buddhism and Jainism.1 

- 1. For a survey of the major proponents of this doctrine of the essentially eirenic and tolerant nature  of Hinduism see VERARDI 2011, pp. 41–58. (For full bibliographic details see References at the end of this  
essay). 

One who wishes to challenge the first of these beliefs might begin by pointing out that before the advent of Islam India lacked any term even loosely corresponding in its semantic range to that of the modern term Hinduism. Sanskrit sources differentiated Vaidika, Vaiṣṇava, Śaiva, Śākta, Saura, Buddhist, and Jaina traditions, but they had no name that denotes the first five of these as a collective entity over and against Buddhism and Jainism.2  +++(What about "Astika"?)+++

- 2. The term Hindu (Arabic and Persian hindū), first used by Muslims to refer to the inhabitants of Hind, that is to say, the lands east of the Indus river, who had not embraced Islam, does not appear in any non-Muslim Indian source known to me before the work of the Kashmirian brahmin court historian Śrīvara, learned in both Sanskrit and Persian, who uses it in the late fifteenth century in the Sanskritized form hindukaḥto refer in the Indo-Islamic manner to those in the population of Kashmir who  were not Muslims (variously called yavanāḥ, mlecchāḥ, turuṣkāḥ, and mausulāḥ in Kashmirian Sanskrit  sources). He does so in his Zaynataraṅgiṇī (Jainataraṅgiṇī), covering the last years of the reign of Sulṭān Zayn al-‘Ābidīn (1459–1470), and, in the second chapter, the short reign (1470–1472) of his son and  successor ḥaydar Šāh, and his Rājataraṅgiṇī, covering the reign of ḥasan Šāh (1472–1484) and the first two years of the reign of Muḥammad Šāh (1484–1486).
  - The passages in these works in which the term hindukaḥ is found are 
      - Zaynataraṅgiṇī 2.122–123: oppression of certain Muslims (yavanāḥ) by Hindus (hindukāḥ) leading on the Sulṭān’s orders to retaliatory oppression of the brahmins (dvijapīḍanam); 
      - Rājataraṅgiṇī 1.213ab: Sulṭān ḥasan Šāh’s mother Gul K◌̲h◌̲ātūn is lamented after her death as one who had been to the observances of the Hindus like the sun that causes the lotus to open its petals (hindukasamācāraśata-patra-ravi-prabhām); 
      - 1.270: some pro-Muslim (mausulavallabhāḥ) merchants who had  
    observed Hindu customs from birth (ājanmahindukācārāḥ) slaughter a cow; - 2.503–507: after the death of the tolerant Sulṭān Zayn al-‘Ābidīn the kingdom became bereft of proper Hindu observance; every year more of the calendrical rites prescribed in the [Nīlamata]purāṇa lapsed; and some merchants, favouring the Muslims (mausulapriyāḥ), gave up the observances proper for them as Hindus (svoci tam· hindukācāram· tyaktvā), slaughtering cows and eating their flesh, ashamed of the ways of their ancestors. 
  - For the distinction between Śrīvara’s two works, hitherto concealed by their publication  as successive parts of a single Rājataraṅgiṇī (Kaul 1966), I follow Slaje 2005. The second work begins with the third chapter of the consolidated edition (Rājataraṅgiṇī 1.213 as cited here = 3.213 of Kaul’s  edition). The evidence of Śrīvara’s learning in Persian, which after the advent of Muslim rule in Kashmir  in 1339 had replaced Sanskrit as the language of court culture, is his Kāvya Kathākautuka, a rendering in  Sanskrit of ‘Abd al-Raḥmān Jāmi’s celebrated Persian narrative poem Yusof o Zoleykā of 1483. 
  - There may be an earlier use of the word by a non-Muslim Indian author. I merely report the earliest uses that I have encountered, these being a century earlier than the earliest occurrences previously noted, namely those in texts of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava tradition, beginning with the Caitanyabhāgavata of Vr̥ndāvanadāsa, c. 1545, cited by Halbfass (1988, p. 192) following O’Connell (1973). There, as in the usage of Śrīvara, the term always appears in contexts of conflict with, or in opposition to, Islam. I note also that the term does not occur in the Rājataraṅgiṇī of Śrīvara’s teacher Jonarāja, which covers the history of Kashmir from 1149 to 1459 (the year of his death). When Jonarāja refers to the ancestral  religion of his community he uses the language of the insider, terming it sadācāraḥ ‘orthopraxy’ (773) and brāhmakriyā (596) ‘rites prescribed by the Veda’, opposing it to the ‘sinful observances of the Muslims’, by which, he says, the kingdom of Kashmir had been defiled (kaśmīramaṇḍale mlecchadurācāreṇa dūṣite [591ab]). 
  - One may ask whether when the term Hindu was introduced following Islamic usage it was used to refer to Hindus in the modern sense, that is to say, to Hindus as opposed to Buddhists and Jainas, or was used to cover the followers of all three non-Islamic religions. It is probable that it was used in the narrower sense, since several centuries earlier the great Khwarezmian scholar Abū Rayḥān Moḥam mad b. Ahmad Bīrūnī (Al-bīrūnī, Alberuni) (973–1050) clearly distinguishes Hindus and Buddhists in his  
Indological magnum opus Ketāb taḥqīq mā le’l-Hend men maqūla maqbūla fi’l-‘aql aw mardūla (entitled India in Sachau’s two-volume English translation [1910]); see, e.g., vol. 1 of that translation, p. 7. 


However, the absence of a name does not entail the absence of a corresponding concept. There is evidence, as we shall see, that by the end of the first millennium of the Christian era the consensus had indeed come to conceptualize a complex entity corresponding to Hinduism as opposed to Buddhism and Jainism, excluding only certain forms of antinomian Śākta-Śaiva observance that could not be  reconciled with basic Vaidika values of ritual purity and the separation of castes. 

Conservative authorities continued to rail against this soft-focus ‘Hinduism’,  with its blurring of the boundaries between the Vaidika and the non-Vaidika, well into the second millennium of the Christian era, the Vaidikas insisting that the prescriptions of the Vaiṣṇava (Pāñcarātrika) and Śaiva scriptures are invalid in their entirety, being based on scriptures that are not part of the Veda or rooted therein (vedamūla-),3 the Śaivas insisting on the absolute superiority of their own revelations and the ultimate inefficacity of those of the Vaidikas and the Vaiṣṇavas, and the Vaiṣṇavas insisting that they too were Vaidikas in spite of Vaidika rejection and in keeping with this insistence fervently condemning the Śaivas,4 in spite of the fact that the Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava systems of observance have much more in common with each than either has with the Vaidika.5 

- 3. An outstanding case of this conservative stance is that of Aparāditya, a twelfth-century ruler of  North Konkan, who devoted much learned effort to resisting the drift into acceptance of the initiated  Śaivas in his long comment on Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti 1.7, the verse that lists all the valid means of knowing  one’s religious duties (dharmapramāṇāni) (vol. 1, pp. 9–20). 
- 4. The Vaiṣṇava stance has been expounded with great clarity by Yāmuna in his Āgamaprāmāṇya. According to Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition, his life span was ad 916/17–1038, a barely credible 121 or 122 years. Mesquita (1973) has proposed that he lived from 966/7 to 1038. The attempt of Yāmuna in South India to persuade the deeply sceptical Vaidikas that the Bhāgavatas are real brahmins reflects a wider struggle. For the objections raised by the Vaidikas against the Bhāgavatas’ claim as presented by Yāmuna are found in much the same form about a century earlier in Kashmir in Jayanta’s topical play Āgamaḍambara, where they appear on the lips of a disgruntled Vaidika officiant (r̥tvik), who complains bitterly  about the attempts of the Bhāgavatas to intrude themselves into the brahmin community by pretend 
ing to be brahmins themselves (4.3, prose, 4.4, prose). 


But the middle ground saw in Śaivas and Pāñcarātrika Vaiṣṇavas proper, that is to say,  in those who had taken initiation (dīkṣā) into these soteriologies and practised their special rites, only variants of observance applicable to specific communities added to the ancient bedrock of Vaidika religion without detriment to the latter; and this view came, as we shall also see, to be accepted not only by the orthoprax  but also by many, perhaps even most, of the initiated themselves. As for the un initiated, whose only rite of religious empowerment had been the upanayanam  that qualified a man for Vaidika observance and the recitation of the Veda, they  had themselves long since developed their own modes of Vaidika worship of the deities of the initiated and integrated them into their daily rites, privileging one  deity as an expression of personal devotion but generally including the others in a syncretistic approach that, through its daily repetition in countless households, must have done much to express and nourish this sense of the greater unity that came to be called Hinduism. 


The thinking behind the concept of this as yet unnamed Hinduism is by its  nature more tolerant than the views that we shall see below of the strict adherents of its competing components. But it is strictly brahmanical: Buddhism and Jainism remain invalid in this thinking. 

However, while certain states did at times adopt a hostile attitude towards  
these two non-Vaidika faiths, we may surmise that in general it was not politic for Indian and Southeast Asian governments during the early mediaeval period to adopt a policy that strongly disadvantaged their Buddhist and, in the case of the subcontinent, Jaina subjects. As we shall see, this supra-brahmanical perspective,  which I see as an answer to the socio-legal question of what forms of religion the state should tolerate or support and which are truly beyond the pale of the per missible, also finds its voice in the learned literature of our period.   

- 5. On the intimate connection between the Pañcarātra and the Śaiva tradition of the Mantramārga see Sanderson 2009a, pp. 61–70. 

Stopping short of accepting that all forms of religion are within the law or, rather, that any form  of religion is above the law, since it excludes the most blatant forms of antinomian  observance, it nonetheless requires tolerance of these long-established traditions. 

In this perspective it may be said that Indian and Southeast Asian states generally propagated tolerance in matters of religion. But it is not the case that any of the individual religions that came within the purview of this tolerance were  tolerant by nature. The long-entrenched contrary view, that the Indian religions  were essentially tolerant, cannot reasonably be maintained in the face of the carefully formulated views of the adherents of these Indian traditions and evidence of sporadic outbreaks of intolerance and persecution. If the religions that flourished during the early mediaeval period in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia  enjoyed in many regions and periods an enviable degree of peaceful co-existence,  this must be explained not through an argument from essence, which leads in evitably to the overlooking or dismissing of contrary evidence, but in terms of a  balance of influence in which no one religious tradition was in a position of such strength that it could rid society of its rivals, a balance of power sustained by the policy of governments. +++(5 anaṅgīkārē’py ayaṁ sāraḥ)+++ 

## Vaidika Exclusivity 
Let us now begin by looking at the extremes that reject or contradict this unity.  Any claim that tolerance of religious diversity is at the heart of Hinduism must overlook the view of the Vaidikas, whose theoreticians flatly denied the validity of any religious practice that was undertaken on the authority of texts lying outside the Veda (vedabāhyāni), that is to say, outside the Vaidika scriptural corpus of Śruti and such secondary literature (Smr̥ti) as was accepted to derive from it. Thus in the ninth or tenth century Medhātithi 6 states in his erudite commentary on the Manusmr̥ti: 7 

- 6. On the probable date of Medhātithi see Kane 1930, p. 275. 
- 7. Manubhāsya, vol. 1, p. 57, ll. 5–6. 

> So all those outside [the Veda], namely the worshippers of the Sun (bhojaka-),8 the followers of the [Vaiṣṇava] Pañcarātra, the Jainas, the [Buddhist] deniers of the self (anātmavādi-),9 the Pāśupatas, and the rest, hold that their doctrines have been authored by exceptional persons or deities who have had direct experience of the truth they teach. They do not claim that their religious practices derive [like ours] from the [eternal and unauthored (apauruṣeya-)] Veda; and indeed their teachings contain doctrines that directly contradict it. 

- 8. The term bhojakaḥ denotes the Maga or Magabrāhmaṇ a officiants of the Sūrya cult (Old Persian magu-), descendants of Pahlavas who established kingdoms in Northwest India in the first century bc. It renders Middle Iranian *bōžak, ‘one who saves’ (Scheftelowitz 1933, pp. 305–306). 
- 9. I have emended the edition’s nirgranthānārthavāda- to nirgranthānātmavādi-, since anārthavāda yields no meaning, while anātmavādi- ‘denier of the self’ yields a meaning fully apposite to the context, defining Buddhists as it does in terms of the doctrine that most starkly differentiates from them all  other Indian religious traditions. 


Similarly, the seventh-century Mīmāṁsaka Kumārila declares: 10 

- 10. Tantravārttika, vol. 1, pp. 114, ll. 20–115, l. 6, on 1.3.3–4. 

> The texts that may not be drawn on, because they contradict the Veda and  
because we can detect their [base] motives, are, we are taught, [the following. Firstly they are] these well-known works of religion-cum-irreligion rejected by Vaidikas and accepted [as scriptures] by the Sāṁkhyas, the followers of the Yoga school, the Pāñcarātrika Vaiṣṇavas, the Pāśupatas,11 the Buddhists, and the Jainas. 

11. By the time of Kumārila, an approximate contemporary of the Buddhist Dharmakīrti, who was active sometime between c. 550 and 650, the Śaiva Mantramārga was well enough established to attract trenchant criticism from the latter. Its earliest scriptural texts go back to the fifth to sixth centuries, inscriptions recording the initiation of kings following its procedures are attested from the seventh onwards, and epigraphical evidence of its monastic institutions goes back to the late sixth (Sander son 2013b, pp. 235–236). It is extremely improbable, therefore, that Kumārila was familiar only with  the Atimārga and not also with the Mantramārga. I am therefore inclined to think that he is using the  term Pāśupata here to cover the Pāśupatas and all subsequent Śaiva developments up to his time, understanding it as meaning ‘one who follows what has been taught by Paśupati’, where Paśupati is to be understood simply as a synonym of Śiva (see, e.g., Nāmaliṅgānuśāsana 1.1.130–134). The same  will apply to Medhātithi’s use of the term Pāśupata in my preceding citation. Both authors are perhaps using what they considered to be the properly Vaidika expression for the teachings of Śiva, following  Mahābhārata 12.337.59ab: sāṁkhyaṁ yogaṁ pañcarātraṁ vedāḥ pāśupataṁ tathā.  

> These hide in the shadow cast by a screen of pious observance containing some elements of the Veda’s teaching; but their real purpose is to win  
social approval, wealth, veneration, and fame. They are contrary to the Veda  and incoherent. The greed and other [vices of their authors] are manifest.  They have been composed on the basis of arguments framed within the limits  of [the means of non-transcendental knowledge, namely] sense-perception,  inference, analogy, and presumption. They are perfumed with the fragrance of  a handful of teachings congruent with Śruti and Smr̥ti, [advocating such virtues as] non-violence, truthfulness, self-control, generosity, and compassion;  but [at the same time] they propagate teachings of a quite different nature, teachings that are little more than means of making a living, by demonstrating the occasional successes of a handful of spells and herbs able to counteract  the effects of poison, to subject people, to drive them out, to drive them mad, and so forth. And [secondly they are] the works even more remote [from the  
Veda] (bāhyatarāṇi) that prescribe [observances] that are contaminated by  
[culturally alien] practices proper to barbarians (mlecchācāramiśra-), such as eating from a skull-bowl (kabhojana-) and wandering naked (nagnacaraṇa-).12 

- 12. Here I propose that Kumārila wrote mlecchācāra-miśra-kabhojana-nagnacaraṇādi rather the edition’s reading mlecchācāra-miśra-kabhojana-nagnācaraṇa, and, as my translation shows, I analyse this compound as mlecchācāramiśra-kabhojana-nagnacaraṇādi, taking ka- in the meaning ‘human head’, ‘skull’ (syn. kapālam) (see, e.g., Abhidhānaratnamālā 5.61). In this I am swayed by the testimony of a  parallel discussion in Medhātithi, Manubhāsya on 2.6: syāt tādr̥śī vedaśākhā yasyām ayaṁ narāsthip ātra-bhojana-nagnacaryādir upadiṣṭo bhavet, ‘There might well be a branch of the Veda [now defunct]  which is such that in it such [practices] as eating from a vessel made from a human skull and wandering naked might have been prescribed’. Jhā (1924) did not see the reference to the skull-bowl users here, dividing the compound as mlecchācāramiśraka-bhojana-ācaraṇa and translating it as follows: ‘absolutely repugnant practices fit for Mlecchas, such as the eating together of many persons, and the like’.  Similarly Kataoka 2011, pt 2, p. 351: ‘barbarian customs, i.e. the practice of eating together’. Evidently  this ‘eating together’ renders Kumārila’s miśrakabhojana-. I argue against this interpretation in detail  in my forthcoming Śaivism and Brahmanism. Those who ate from a bowl fashioned from a human skull  were the ascetics of the Lākula and Kāpālika traditions of the Atimārga and, in the Mantramārga and  Kulamārga, persons engaged in the propitiation of Bhairava and/or Cāmuṇḍā/Kālī through the practice of the Kāpālika observance. On the three Mārgas (Ati-, Mantra, and Kula-) see Sanderson 2014.
  - Kumārila’s and Medhātithi’s ‘wandering naked’ (nagnacaraṇam, nagnacaryā) probably refers to the  practice of wandering Jaina mendicant ascetics. See also Medhātithi on 4.30: ‘The pāṣaṇḍinaḥ are the red-robed, the naked wanderers, and others, who adopt the insignia [of religious observances] that are  outside [the Veda]’ (pāṣaṇḍino bāhyaliṅgino raktapaṭanagnacarakādayaḥ). The expression ‘red-robed’ (raktapaṭaḥ) is commonly used as a somewhat undignified term for Buddhists in non-Buddhist sources, as in Āgamaḍambara, prose before 1.17 (bho raktapaṭa) and 3.26 (raktapaṭocchiṣṭaṁ), and Śaṇkara,  Brahmasūtrabhāsya on 2.2.35, and the pairing of Buddhists and Jainas is standard. 

Concluding his argument he points out that greed and other such base urges  
(lobhādi) are a sufficient explanation of the source of all these traditions, and that they themselves make no claim to be Veda-based (vedamūlatvam). So, he says, it is these that are referred to by Manu when he speaks of followers of forbidden religious  practices (pāṣaṇḍinaḥ) and rules that they should not be honoured even with speech:13 

> [The householder] should not honour even with speech those who follow  
forbidden religious practices,14 those who practice professions forbidden to  their caste, those who practice religion for profit, deceivers, those who reason  [against the teachings of the Vedas], and pious hypocrites. 

- 13. Manusmr̥ti 4.30. 
- 14. The term pāṣaṇḍin-, often misleadingly translated ‘heretic’, is defined as I have translated it here by Medhātithi’s gloss on pāṣaṇḍam, from which pāṣaṇḍin- is formed by the addition of the possessive suffix,  
in his commentary on Manusmr̥ti 1.118: pāṣaṇḍam pratiṣiddhavratacaryā ‘pāṣaṇḍam is to practice a forbidden religious observance’ and on 5.89: śāstra-parityāgena bāhya-darśanāśrayaṁ nara-śiraḥ-kapāla-raktāmbarādi-dhāraṇaṁ pāṣaṇḍam - ‘pāṣaṇḍam is to turn one’s back on the teachings [of the Veda] and  thereby to carry the skull of a human head, to wear red robes and the like, [practices] that are proper to religions outside [the Veda]’. The term ‘heretic’ is better reserved to denote professed followers of  a religion whose views or practices reject or are seen as rejecting the established norms of that same religion. From the Vaidika point of view those it terms pāṣaṇḍin- are apostates rather than heretics, Vaidika observance being seen as the default and all other faiths as arising through its rejection. 

The context of this prohibition is the behaviour of householders towards uninvited guests (atithiḥ), the respectful feeding of whom is one of their cardinal duties. Commenting on this verse Medhātithi says that if a would-be recipient of food belonging to these prohibited categories arrives at the home, which in our  present context means any follower of the Pañcarātra or of any one of the Śaiva  systems, a Buddhist, or a Jaina,15 he is not to be greeted respectfully, nor to receive the customary enquiries concerning his birth and learning, nor to be offered a seat and the rest. He may be fed, but only as one feeds untouchables and the like.16  

- 15. The South Indian Vaiṣṇava Yāmuna cites a text without attribution in his Āgamaprāmāṇya (p. 26, ll. 9–7) that rules on the authority of Smr̥ti that the term pāṣaṇḍam covers the whole range of non Vaidika systems: the Vaiṣṇava Pañcarātra, the Śaiva [Mantramārga], the Pāśupata, the Kāpālika, Buddhism, and Jainism. 
- 16. Manubhāsya on 4.30: ‘There is certainly no question of respectfully giving them a seat and so forth. Nor may one even speak to them, saying, for example, “Welcome. Please be seated here”. One  is allowed to give them food [but only] as one would to untouchables and the like (śvapacādivat). Concerning this giving of food the venerable Kr̥ṣṇadvaipāyana has taught the following Smr̥ti: “One should  not enquire concerning his birth or learning”.’ 

This equation with untouchables is more than rhetorical. For other Smr̥ti  passages tell us that even the sight of such persons is pollutant for the orthoprax, let alone physical contact: 17 

> If he comes into physical contact with Buddhists, Pāśupatas, materialists, deniers [of life after death, the validity of the Veda, and the like], or brahmins  engaged in improper employment, he should bathe fully clothed. 

- 17. The ṣaṭtriṁśanmata quoted by Aparāditya, Yājñavalkyasmr̥tiṭīkā, p. 923. 


and: 18 

- 18. An unnamed Smrti text (smrtyantaram) quoted by Aparāditya, Yājñavalkyasmr̥tiṭīkā, p. 923. 

> If he sees Jainas, Pāśupatas, Buddhists, Kāla[mukha]s, [Śākta] Kaulas, or  
peripatetic [mendicants] he should glance at the sun. If he has come into contact with any of them he should bathe fully clothed. 

Likewise a verse from an unidentified Smr̥ti text cited with approval in the  
digest-like commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti attributed to Aparāditya, the  twelfth-century Śilāhāra ruler of North Konkan: 19 

- 19. There were two Aparādityas among the Śilāhāra kings of North Konkan. The earliest known inscription of Aparāditya I is dated in ad 1127 (cii 6:20), and his reign ended in 1148 (cii 6:62). Aparāditya II  has dated inscriptions from 1184 to 1197 (cii 6:30–32, 63). The last known inscription of his predecessor  Mallikārjuna is dated in 1162 (cii 6:29) and the first known inscription of his successor Anantadeva II is  dated in 1198 (cii 6:33). Kane has argued (1930, p. 334) that the great commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti is more probably to be assigned to the first of these two Aparādityas on the grounds that the  work is quoted in the Smr̥ticandrikā of Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa. This is because he dates that work c. 1200  (1930, p. 346) on the evidence that it cites Vijñāneśvara and is cited by Hemādri. This would not preclude Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa’s having known a work by Aparāditya II, but it would, he argues, leave uncomfortably little time for the work to have become well enough known to have been cited as an authority.  
  - This is less compelling than it seems, since Hemādri tells us that he wrote while he was a minister of  Mahādeva, the Seüna king of Devagiri, who ruled from 1260 to 1271, as Kane himself agrees (1930,  p. 357). There is therefore no good reason to date Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa as early as 1200 on the grounds that  he is cited by Hemādri, and there is therefore no good reason to doubt that the Yājñavalkyasmr̥tiṭīkā was by Aparāditya II solely because it was cited by Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa. 
  - However, that the author of that work was indeed Aparāditya I does find some support in a fact not noted by Kane, namely that the colophons of that work describe the author simply as the Śilāhāra king Śrīmad-Aparādityadeva, which  is as we find Aparāditya I modestly identified in his inscriptions (cii 6:20–22 [śrīmadaparādityadeva- or  
śrī-aparādityadeva-]). Aparāditya II assumed the much grander title of Mahārājādhirāja (cii 6:32). 
  - A further point in favour of Aparāditya I is that the author of the commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti is  uncompromising in his rejection of the non-Vaidika religion of the Pāñcarātrikas and Śaivas, whereas  Aparāditya II, as we can see from inscriptions, had one Vyomaśiva/Vyomaśambhu, an initiated Saiddhāntika Śaiva officiant, as his chief minister (Mahāpradhāna/Mahāmātya), as did his immediate predecessor on the throne, Mallikārjuna (r. c. ad 1155–1170). See cii 6:29, 30, and 32. 
 

> If he sees Kāpālikas, Pāśupatas, Śaivas [of the Mantramārga], or Kārukas,20 he should gaze at the sun [in order to purify himself]. If he has come into physical contact with them he should bathe.21 

- 20. The Kārukas of this passage are a group closely related to the Lākulas and sometimes take their  place when the totality of Śaivas is intended, as here, through the listing of their four major types:  Pāñcārthika Pāśupatas, Lākulas/Kālamukhas, Kāpālikas, and [Mantramārgic] Śaivas. Cf. 
  - Bhāskara on  Brahmasūtra 2.3.37: tatra māheśvarāś catvāraḥ pāśupatāḥ śaivāḥ kāpālikāḥ kāṭhakasiddhāntinaś ceti;  
  - Vācaspatimiśra, Bhāmatī on Śaṇkara, Brahmasūtrabhāsya on 2.3.37: śaivāḥ pāśupatāḥ kāruṇikasiddhāntinaḥ kāpālikāś ceti. 
  - In these two passages the readings kāṭhakasiddhāntinaś and kāruṇikasiddhāntinaś yield no apposite sense and are both, I propose, corruptions of kārukasiddhāntinaś ‘followers of the Kāruka doctrine’ introduced by later Vaidika scholars unfamiliar with this somewhat obscure Śaiva  tradition. 
- 21. Yājñavalkyasmr̥tiṭīkā, p. 18. According to Viṣṇudharma 25.7, 25.11cd, and 25.29cd (quoted by Aparāditya, Yājñavalkyasmr̥tiṭīkā, p. 171, ll. 18 and 29), purification in these cases requires the power  of the Śuciṣad Mantra: ‘If the learned has spoken with [any of] these persons [following a forbidden religious practice] he should meditate on Viṣṇu Śuciṣad . . . If he has seen one he should utter [the Mantra] oṁ namaḥ Śuciṣad and then glance at the sun . . . If he has come into physical contact with one the learned will be purified if he bathes while mentally reciting the Śuciṣad.’

> On the evidence of this further Smr̥ti [it is established that] the Śaivas and  other [sectarians mentioned in it, that is to say] those who adhere to bodies  of [non-Vaidika] scripture such as those proclaimed by Śiva (śaivādi), are considered by those fully versed in the injunctions of the three Vedas to be as pollutant as the basest of untouchables (antyāvasāyivat) 23 if seen or touched. 

- 22. Yājñavalkyasmr̥tiṭīkā, p. 18. 
- 23. The term antyavasāyī, here rendered ‘the basest of untouchables’ but literally ‘one who makes his abode in the lowest [of places]’, is defined in the Manusmr̥ti as the cremation-ground-dwelling son of a Caṇḍāla man born to a Niṣāda woman, despised even by the other divisions of the excluded (bāhyānām api garhitam) (10.39). Bhāruci comments in his Manuśāstravivaraṇa: ‘Cremation-ground-dwelling  means working and living therein. This being the case he should be recognized as even more sinful  (pāpataraḥ) than the Candāla.’ 


It is clear from the discussion in which Aparāditya makes this point that for  him, and no doubt for the Smr̥ti in question, the term Śaiva here refers to all  branches of the Mantramārga, including the Siddhānta, in spite of the latter’s  relatively innocuous, Veda-congruent observances. 

Nor was this vituperative rejection of all religious traditions other than the  Vaidika confined to theory. For Manu goes so far as to exhort kings to put it into  practice by expelling all followers of such religious systems from his kingdom: 

> [The ruler] should expel from his capital without delay any gamblers, news mongers, men of violence, men adhering to non-Vaidika religious observances (pāṣaṇḍasthān), men engaged in occupations not in keeping with their  caste, and publicans. For if these are present in the kingdom they are like  thieves in disguise for the king. They constantly oppress his virtuous subjects  with their deviant activities.24 

24. Manusmr̥ti 9.225–6. In his commentary on this passage Bhāruci makes it clear that although Manu states only that they should be expelled from the capital (purāt), the implication is that they should be exiled from the whole kingdom: ‘He should expel them from the capital. It is implied that these should be expelled from the whole kingdom too (rāṣṭrād apy ete ’rthato nirvāsyāḥ), since the effect of their  banishment from the kingdom [and the capital] is the same.’ 

For the Vaidikas, then, there certainly was no Hinduism as defined in our  
opening paragraph, since they looked with abhorrence on all systems, including the Vaiṣṇava Pañcarātra and the varieties of Śaivism, that deviated from their definition of orthopraxy; and, as we have seen, the Manusmr̥ti, far from tolerating these with indifference, urged the state to banish their adherents. Moreover, it enjoined the orthoprax to avoid dwelling in any place where they were numerous.25 

- 25. Manusmr̥ti 4.61: ‘He should not live in any kingdom governed by Śūdras, in one full of people who neglect their religion, in one occupied by communities adhering to non-Vaidika religious observances (pāṣaṇḍi-gaṇākrānte), or in one beset by the lowest born.’ Medhātithi gives in clarification of the last the case of Balkh (bāhlīkāḥ) in ancient Bactria between the Hindu Kush and the Amu Darya (Oxus), which, he accurately reports, was beset by people of alien culture(s) (yathā bāhlīkā mlecchaiḥ). 

It may be doubted that the Manusmr̥ti’s rule of exile was often if ever implemented; but the idea that it should be put into effect survived centuries during  which the non-Vaidika systems flourished and Śaivism among them rose to become the dominant religion of the era.26 

- 26. On the rise of Śaivism to dominance in early mediaeval India see Sanderson 2009a. 

For this survival is gently satirized  in Kashmir around the turn of the ninth and tenth centuries in Jayanta’s play  Āgamaḍambara (‘Much Ado About Religion’). There two Vaidikas – an officiant  (r̥tvik) and an instructor (upādhyāyaḥ) – face the failure of the ultra-orthoprax camp to persuade the state to revert to a purely Vaidika utopia free of Śaivas, Pāñcarātrikas, Buddhists, and Jainas. The official protest of its champion, the Snātaka Saṁkarṣaṇa, fresh from his long training in the Veda, had met with initial success. The government of Kashmir had agreed to ban a particularly antinomian and subversive cult of the Kaula type known as the Black-Shawl Observance  (nīlāmbaravratam), a measure whose historicity is confirmed by another source.27 

- 27. That the suppression of the followers of the Black-Shawl Observance was not the theatrical invention of Jayanta but a historical fact is attested by Jayanta himself in his philosophical masterpiece  Nyāyamañjarī. For he writes there (vol. 1, p. 649, l. 4): ‘King Śaṇkaravarman, knowing the nature of [true]  religion (dharmatattvajñaḥ), banned (nivārayām āsa) the Black-Shawl Observance, in which uninhibited couples would indulge in many [indecent] activities (-aniyatastripuṁsavihitabahuceṣṭam) wrapped in a single black shawl (asitaikapaṭanivīta- em : amitaikapaṭanivīta- Ed.), because he realized that it was  without precedent (apūrvam), having been invented (kalpitam) by some libertines.’ That this was a variety of Kaula Śākta-Śaivism is apparent from the account of it in the Āgamaḍambara, where it is clearly a cult involving unrestrained sexual indulgence and the drinking of intoxicating liquor, only meat among the Kaulas’ three M’s (madyam, māṁsaḥ, and maithunam; see Tantrāloka 29.97–100b, quoting the Yogasaṁcāra) failing to be mentioned here. It is confirmed by the account of the Śaiva scriptural canon quoted from the otherwise lost Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṁhitā by Takṣakavarta in his Nityādi-saṁgraha-paddhati, an account that was the locus classicus for the Kashmirians. For this includes a Nīlāmbara in its list of ‘eight Kaula[tantra]s’: nīlāmbaraṁ sutāraṁ ca sandhyā yogini-ḍāmaram | svāyam-bhuvaṁ siddha-mataṁ gaṇākhyaṁ khecarī-matam | aṣṭau kaulās tv amī khyātāh sadyaḥ-pratyaya-kārakāḥ (Nityādi-saṁgraha-paddhati f. 10r13–14). Some of these, including Nīlāmbara, also appear in a list of Śaiva  scriptures in the Kaula Kularatnoddyota f. 2r2: nīlāmbaraṁ ca tārākhyaṁgaṇākhyaṁ khecarīmatam.
  - This is not the only report of action against this cult. According to a story about its followers, the Nīlapaṭa-prabandha, contained in the Purātana-prabandha-saṁgraha (p. 19) compiled by the Jaina scholar Jinavijaya Muni, King Bhoja, the famous Paramāra emperor who ruled from Dhārā in Mālava  for most of the first half of the eleventh century (on his date see Sanderson 2014, p. 16, fn. 61), heard  about this cult from his daughter, who told him that she was going to join it. He then invited all of its  adherents, forty-nine couples in all, to assemble in his presence on the pretext that he wished to be come their devotee, executed all the men, and sent the women into exile. That they were Kaulas is  evident from a verse that they recite in answer to Bhoja’s asking them whether they are happy: ‘There  aren’t rivers flowing with wine; there aren’t mountains made of meat; and the whole world doesn’t  consist of women. How [then] can a Nīlapaṭa [“one of the Black Shawl (cult)”] be satisfied?’ (na nadyo  madyavāhinyo na ca māṁsamayā nagāḥ | na ca nārīmayaṁ viśvaṁ kathaṁ nīlapaṭaḥ sukhī). For this is  a variant of a verse about Kaulism cited by Rājānaka Jayaratha on Tantrāloka 15.169c–170b: na nadyo  madhuvāhinyo na palaṁ parvatopamam | strīmayaṁ na jagat sarvaṁ kutaḥ siddhiḥ kulāgame. 

But this led to panic among the Śaivas in general, who felt that they too might  be driven out. The status quo is restored by the king by summoning Saṁkarṣaṇa,  finding him a wife, favouring him with the (white parasol and other) insignia  of distinction (mānaiḥ),28 a golden fillet for his head (paṭṭabandhena),29 and the honorific Śrī- (śrīśabdena),30 and putting him in charge of the Department for the Protection of Religion (dharma-rakṣādhikāre niyuktaḥ) with authority through out the kingdom.

- 28. Cf. the Cambodian Sanskrit inscription K. 762 of ad 673, v. 6: sitātapatrādi-sanmānaḥ (Cœdès 1937– 1966, vol. 1, pp. 12–15). 
- 29. On the designs of the various fillets, also called mukuṭaḥ, to be worn by the king, the chief queen, the crown prince, and the general, and as an honour bestowed by the king (prasādapaṭṭaḥ), see  Br̥hatsaṁhitā 48.1–5. According to that source all are to be made of pure gold (48.4cd). 
- 30. This transforms him from plain Bhaṭṭa-Saṁkarṣaṇa into Bhaṭṭaśrī-Saṁkarṣaṇa; see Āgamaḍambara, prose imediately before 3.1: ‘Inhabitants of the capital and country, Bhaṭṭaśrī-Saṁkarṣaṇa, at the command of His Majesty Mahārāja Śaṇkaravarman, hereby informs you . . .’ Other Kashmirians named  with this title are Kallaṭa (author of the Spandakārikā), Jayanta (author of the Nyāyamañjarī), Nārāyaṇa  (author of the Stavacintāmaṇi), Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha (author of the commentary on the Mr̥gendra), Bilhaṇa  (author of the Vikramāṇka-deva-carita), Bhāskara (author of the Śivasūtravārtika), Bhūtirāja (Guru of Abhinavagupta’s father), Mukula (teacher of Pratihārendurāja), Rāmakaṇṭha (son of Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha),  Vāmana (=Hrasvanātha), Śaṇkara (the father of Cakradhara), Śaśāṇkadhara (the Guru of Cakradhara), Śitikaṇṭha (author of the Kaulasūtra), Śivasvāmin (author of the Mahākāvya Kapphiṇābhyudaya), and Somānanda (author of the Śivadr̥ṣṭi). 
 

In this office he goes forthwith to the hermitage of the ascetic  
Bhaṭṭāraka Dharmaśiva, apparently the official representative of all the Śaiva groups in Kashmir, to reassure him that the Śaivas will not be further targetted.  

The officiant laments: 

> What a disaster! The way things have turned out is not at all what we en visaged. We imagined that all the religions outside the Veda would be  suppressed and that in this state of affairs the result would be (vedabāhya sakalāgama-tiraskāreṇa) that the whole kingdom would become our fiefdom (sarvam asmad-bhogyam eva bhuvanaṁ bhaviṣyatīti cintitam). But the outcome is that the alien religions (bāhyāgamāḥ) are in precisely the same position as before (yathānyāsam eva). For [v. 4.1]:   
> These Śaivas, Pāśupatas, Pāñcarātrikas, Sāṁkhyas, Buddhists, Jainas, and the rest, are all enjoying exactly the same status as before. Damn  the Snātaka [Saṁkarṣaṇa]’s useless erudition!  

The Upādhyāya responds: 

> My friend, [the Snātaka] has now become the servant of the king, has he not?  And the king is entirely devoted to Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ). So it is inevitable that [Saṁkarṣaṇa] should be directing all his thoughts to winning his favour. For [v. 4.2]:  
> In the presence of kings their servants habitually do nothing but par rot their commands and being greedy to enhance their positions they  no more distinguish between what is good or bad than echoes.  

The officiant agrees but asks how they can survive as Vaidikas in a society that  
under-values them: 

> It is indeed as you hold, my friend: it is a rare man that in disregard of his  own interests will impartially restrict his thoughts to what is ordained by the Veda. But how are we to survive [here] when we can support ourselves only by  purely Vaidika services such as performing sacrifices for others [in my case]  and teaching the Veda [in yours]? 

The Upādhyāya says: 

> My friend, we shall live out our future as we have our past, satisfied with nothing more than a mouthful of food and cloth to cover us. The real world, it seems, no longer pays more than lip-service to the orthoprax Vaidika position. The non-Vaidika elements have become too strong to be  
suppressed, and the Vaidika camp is too weak, and impoverished, to lobby successfully to diminish their power. The king, Śaṇkaravarman, is after all a devotee  of Śiva inclined to be indulgent towards all forms of established religion,31 and his queen, Sugandhā, we are told, favours the Pāñcarātrikas, as does, according to  report, one of the king’s functionaries.32 

- 31. Āgamaḍambara, Act 3, prose between 3.3 and 3.4: ‘For the king, his Majesty Śaṇkaravarman is entirely devoted to Śiva (parama-māheśvaraḥ) and shows compassion to all religious disciplines  (sarvāśrameṣu ca dayāluḥ).’ 
- 32. Āgamaḍambara, Act 4, prose after 4.4. 

## The Śaivas’ Inclusivist View of Their Own and the Vaidikas’ Religion 
As for the Śaivas, they likewise seem to undermine the unity of Hinduism by insisting not merely on the validity of their own scriptures but also on their superiority to the Vaidika scriptures and indeed to the scriptures of all non-Śaiva systems. This was already so in the earliest known Śaiva initiatory system, that of the  Pāñcārthika Pāśupatas of the Atimārga, whose ascetic initiates were to see themselves as having severed all ties with the Vaidika religion, leaving behind their former obligations to the gods and ancestors to focus their devotion on Śiva/ Rudra alone;33 and it continued to be so in the Mantramārga, even though this  later form of the religion, in evidence from about 450–550 onwards, expanded  the community of the initiated beyond that of ascetics, important though they  continued to be, by opening up initiation to householders, allowing them, indeed requiring them, to remain in this status after they had received initiation. 

It might appear, therefore, that Śaivism was as much distinct from, and  opposed to, the religion of the Vaidikas as the latter was to the former and as  both were to Buddhism and Jainism. However, while the Śaivas thought their  scriptures superior to the Vaidikas’ and the Vaidikas thought their own superior, the two traditions’ views of each other were not symmetrical, not at least  where the Śaivas of the Mantramārga were concerned, these alone having left  us adequate evidence of their views on this issue. For while most Vaidika theoreticians during this period condemned the Śaiva scriptures as false, the Śaivas  of the Mantramārga held unanimously that the Śruti and Smr̥ti of Brahmanism are universally and uniquely valid in their own sphere, that of prescribing the conduct and religious observance obligatory for persons in their identity as mar ried and unmarried members of the caste-classes (varṇāśramadharmaḥ), and that as such they are man’s sole means of valid knowledge both of all actions (karma)  that benefit and harm the soul’s destiny in the domain of recurrent incarnation (samṣāraḥ) and of the nature of the consequences of these actions, from the rewards of the heavens to the tortures of the hells. 

Nor did they deny the reality of Brahmanism’s goal, that of liberation  

33. See, e.g., Kauṇḍinya, Pañcārthabhāṣya on 2.9: ‘This brahmin’s qualification and obligation to make  
offerings to the gods and his ancestors applied [only] before [his initiation]. Therefore he should [now]  
withdraw devotion from these gods and ancestors and in place of both fix his heart on Maheśvara and  
worship him and no other. The word ca here [in pitr̥vac ca] expresses prohibition. It implies that the  
reason why he should no longer make offerings to the [other] gods and his ancestors is that they lack  
the agency that he used to attribute to them.’

tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . . 
(mokṣaḥ), offered to those who aspired to escape recurrent incarnation through  
knowledge, unmotivated obedience to ritual injunctions, or both. They denied  
only that it was ultimate, holding that true, definitive liberation lay beyond it and  
could be reached through Śaivism alone, by undergoing initiation in the pres 
ence of the Maṇḍala of Śiva (śivamaṇḍaladīkṣā) and then following the Śaiva ritual  
and meditative disciplines, or, in the case of those prevented by incapacity or so 
cial responsibilites from taking up those disciplines, notably their royal patrons,  
through initiation followed by fervent devotion manifest in support of the Śaiva  
religion and its institutions. 
Nor was the validity of the Vaidika scriptures irrelevant to the Śaivas within  
their own world of Śaiva rites and belief. Indeed Sadyojyotis, who is much the  
earliest of the commentators on the Śaiva scriptures whose works have reached  
us – he flourished sometime between the second half of the seventh century and  
the beginning of the ninth, probably no later than the first half of the eighth34 –  
insisted that the defence of the validity of the Vaidika scriptures (Śruti and Smr̥ti)  
is essential to a belief in the validity of the scriptures of the Śaivas themselves. 
He offered two cogent reasons. The first is that if the Vaidika scriptures were  
not the source of valid knowledge in their domain, as the Buddhists and Jains insist,  
then Śaivism’s central claim that it frees the initiate from the cosmic hierarchy of the  
levels of incarnation would be empty. Śaivas must believe that the Vaidika scripural  
corpus is valid because the initiation rituals prescribed in their scriptures and per 
formed by Śiva himself through their officiants bring about the progressive freeing  
of the soul from a cosmos created and maintained for and by the enactment and con 
sequences of meritorious and demeritorious actions, and these actions, as we have  
seen, are held by the Śaivas to be good and bad on the authority of the Veda alone. 
The second reason – and it is this that is more weighty in an assessment of  
the lived relations between Śaivism and Vaisika orthopraxy – is that the Mantra 
mārga’s scriptures themselves insist that the rules of the Vaidika socio-religious  
order are binding on Śaiva initiates. Śaivas were subject to that order at the time  
34. See Sanderson 2007a. 
171 
33211 Honoris Causa 3P.indd 171 11/18/15 5:22 PM
Honoris Causa 
of their initiation, and to the extent that they chose to continue to live within it  
after their initiation they were enjoined to continue to adhere to its rules.35 
That the Śaiva scriptures do indeed require this conformity is well illustrated  
in the following passage, much cited by the commentators: 
So he should not transgress (na laṅghayet) the practices of his caste-class and  
[Vaidika] discipline (varṇāśramācārān) even in thought (manasāpi). He should  
remain (tiṣṭhet) in the discipline (āśrame) in which he was when he was initi ated into the Śaiva religion (dīkṣitaḥ śivaśāsane) and [at the same time] main tain the ordinances of Śiva (śivadharmaṁ ca pālayet).36 
There is another respect in which the Vaidikas’ view of Śaivism and the Śai 
vas’ view of Vaidika religion were asymmetrical. For while the Vaidika tradition  
made no attempt to justify its validity in Śaiva terms, the Śaivas, in their eager 
ness to establish themselves in what was by that time a fundamentally brahman 
ical society, attempted to persuade the orthoprax that the Śaiva corpus was valid  
not only because it recognized the Vaidika ordinances as binding on all including  
the Śaivas themselves but also by attempting to undermine the Vaidikas’ attacks  
on the legitimacy of their religious practices by pointing to the abundant evidence  
of the promotion of the worship of Rudra or Śiva, by then considered one and the  
same, that is found both in Śruti texts and in the secondary Vaidika scriptures. 
Thus in his commentary on the Mr̥gendratantra the tenth-century Kash mirian Saiddhāntika Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha cites the presence of such practices  
in the traditions of all four Vedas. The passage on which he is commenting is the  
narrative introduction to the Tantra.37 In the hermitage of Badarī, Bharadvāja  
35. For this argument see Sadyojyotis, Nareśvaraparīkṣā, 3.74–76. I have emended yatnaṁ sarvaṁ karoti in 74b to yatnaṁ sarvaḥ karoti following Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha’s paraphrase in his commentary:  
sarveṇa . . . yatno vidheyaḥ. 
36. This passage is cited, for example, by Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha, in his commentary on Nareśvaraparīkṣā 
3.76. His father, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha, cites it in his commentary on Mr̥gendratantra, Vidyāpada p. 63,  
ll. 13–15, attributing to the Bhārgavottara, which has not, to my knowledge, survived.

and other sages install an image of Śiva and undertake asceticism before it. The  
god Indra comes to the hermitage and asks them why they are not following the  
religion of the Veda (codanādharmaḥ). They reply that the method of propiti ating Śiva with asceticism that they are following is indeed Vaidika and point  
out (v. 6) that the Veda contains Mantras whose deity is Rudra and procedures  
for causing him to come into one’s presence. In his commentary on this verse  
Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha elaborates, citing a six-month-long ascetic procedure for  
the summoning of Rudra into the propitiator’s presence taught in the now lost  
Rudrakalpa that was a supplement (Pariśiṣṭa) of the Śrautasūtra of the Kāṭhaka  
Yajurvedins, the use of the long Yajurvedic litany known as the Eleven Rudras  
(rudraikādaśinī saṁhitā), probably its recitation while one inundates the Liṅga  
(rudrābhiṣekaḥ), a practice still current among the Taittirīya Yajurvedins in the  
Śiva temples of South India, sacrificial procedures using Mantras and chants of  
the r̥gveda and Sāmaveda found in the r̥gvidhāna and Sāmavidhāna, and proce dures for the propitiation of Rudra found in the Atharvavedic corpus. 
Similarly, in his commentary on Sadyojyotis’s Mokṣakārikā Bhaṭṭa  
Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha’s son Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha turns to the corpus of secondary  
Vaidika scriptures, arguing that these contain abundant historical evidence that  
Śaivism was accepted by venerable figures of remote antiquity whose standing as  
men learned in the Veda is beyond question. He cites the rule that Śaivas must  
remain in their castes and life-disciplines, not transgressing the ordinances of  
those institutions even in thought, and then addresses the Vaidikas as follows:38 
So this [teaching of Śiva] is not a forbidden form of religion (na pāṣaṇḍatvam)  
even from your point of view [as Vaidikas]. This is because it does not conflict  
with the Vedas, and because there is [Vaidika] scriptural evidence that it was  
accepted by men learned in the Vedas. In the Purāṇas, the Mahābhārata,  
and the like we learn that Śveta, Upamanyu, and other great sages under 
took religious practice within this [teaching of Śiva]. In the [Mahā]bhārata  
we learn that Nara, Nārāyaṇa [=Arjuna and Vāsudeva], and Aśvatthāman

did the same, in the words ‘The god that you [Aśvatthāman] have worshipped  
in an anthropomorphic image in every age those two have worshipped in the  
Liṅga,’39 and also that it was by propitiating Śiva that the Lord Vāsudeva  
achieved his goal in Suvarṇākṣa, as is related in the verse ‘O Kr̥ṣṇa, you will  
be the man most dear to me in the world; and the whole world will turn to  
face you [in adoration]. Of this there is no doubt,’ [and Paraśurāma received  
the axe with which he slew Kārtavīrya.] 40 Moreover in the Smr̥tis we have  
references to such pious acts for the benefit of the public (pūrto dharmaḥ)  
as that of establishing a temple [of Śiva, as in] ‘He who makes a temple of  
Śiva, built with baked bricks’ 41 and ‘in pious acts for the benefit of the public  
one should know [that the reward is] liberation.’ 42 Then there is the evidence  
of our own eyes in the form of the Pr̥thukeśvara [of Pr̥thu], the Rāmeśvara  
[of Rāma], and [many] other [Śivas that have been installed in temples by  
exemplary Vaidikas in ancient times]. Furthermore, the Veda confirms the  
validity of the teaching of Śiva in such Upaniṣads as the Śvetāśvatara and in  
Mantra-texts such as the Atharvaśiras. So none of the [three] faults that would  
entail the invalidity [of the Śaiva scripture] from your point of view applies:  
there is no disagreement [concerning the omniscience of Śiva, the creator of  
our scriptures], there is no lack of proof [of their validity], and they have not  
been adopted by a small minority.43

monasteries. See, e.g., Varāhapurāṇa 168.21; 170.33–58.

omniscient is proved by the existence of an unbroken tradition to that effect from his time to the  
present. For a detailed discussion of this verse and the three that follow and their interpretation by

So Mantramārgic Śaivism, while claiming to transcend Brahmanism by offer 
ing true liberation, was nonetheless closely tied to it. It was the Vaidika world  
rather than the Buddhist or the Jaina through which Śaivas rose to salvation; and  
on their path thereto they continued to be bound by its rules, adding their Śaiva  
obligations rather than substituting them for the Vaidika. They looked, more 
over, to the Vaidika scriptural corpus to provide proof of the validity of their own  
scriptures. The evidence adduced as proof is not cogent, since none of it refers to  
the specific practices of initiatory Śaivism; it refers only to forms of propitiation  
that had long been part of Vaidika observance. Nonetheless, the attempt reveals  
the concern of the Saiddhāntikas to be considered valid by the adherents of the  
Vaidika tradition that they claimed to rise above. 
The Properly Śaiva Attitude of Śaivas  
Towards Their Vaidika Rites 
Now this extension from the purely Śaiva domain of the ascetic in the Atimārga  
into the Vaidika domain of the Śaiva householder added in the Mantramārga  
opened the door to a process of Śaiva-Vaidika hybridization, in which rites of  
both kinds were maintained and co-ordinated without a proper sense of their  
distinctness. The Śaivas’ theoreticians, aware that this development had the  
potential to produce a blurring of the boundary between the two domains  
that would undermine the faith of Śaivas in the independence and supremacy  
of Śaivism, ruled that while initiated Śaiva householders were thus subject to  
two bodies of injunction – both the Śaiva and the Vaidika – their attitude  
towards adherence to the latter was to differ fundamentally from that of the  
Vaidikas. 
Two passages of early Saiddhāntika Śaiva scripture much cited by the com 
mentators clarify this attitude. The first of these is in the Sarvajñānottara. In the  
context of its prescription that only persons in two of the four Vaidika disciplines,  
those of the unmarried scholar and the married householder, may be consecrated  
as Śaiva officiants, it tells us that the Śaiva should maintain his Vaidika obser 
vances after initiation but without believing that they are fully real. He is to do  
them but without subjective commitment. He should not think that by accom 
modating Vaidika rites beside the Śaiva he brings about a doubling of the benefit

that he will derive or that if he were to omit them he would damage that benefit.  
He is to see himself as acting in this regard not for his own advantage but so as  
not to undermine through a pointless non-conformity the Vaidika order within  
which Śaivism is embedded.44 
The second passage is in the Mataṅgapārameśvara. This clarifies the matter  
in the language of the Mīmāṁsā by saying that though the initiate should main tain his Vaidika duties, here called ‘the mundane observance’ (laukikācāraḥ), he  
must not conceive of them as ancillary elements (aṅgam) of his Śaiva observances,  
which is to say, as elements without which those observances would be incom 
plete and therefore inefficacious.45 
The Śākta-Śaiva Attitude Towards Vaidika  
Observance Among Initiates 
The view seen in the Sarvajñānottara that the Śaiva should conform to Vaid 
ika injunction only for the sake of others tended not to be emphasised in the  
later Saiddhāntika exegetical literature, which seems to be more eager to stress  
conformity with Vaidika injunctions than to justify this from a properly Śaiva  
standpoint. But the Śākta-Śaiva scholars of such traditions as the Krama and  
Trika, whose ritual practice was further distanced from Vaidika norms than  
the Saiddhāntikas’, preserved a strong emphasis on Śaivism’s transcendence,46 
even arguing that the true reason for conformity with Vaidika observance was  
spiritual immaturity. Thus Abhinavagupta’s pupil Kṣemarāja (fl. c. 1000–1050)  
asserts that one should continue to perform the Vaidika ritual of venerating the  
Juncture of the day (brāhmī saṁ dhyā) before one venerates it in the Śaiva manner  
(śaivī saṁ dhyā) only so long as one’s mind is in thrall to one’s constructed social  
identity as a member of a caste. In support of this position he cites a passage  
from the Saiddhāntika Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṁ graha to the effect that the Vaidika

ritual of the Juncture is optional but the Śaiva compulsory. But he leaves out that  
part of the passage in which we learn that the option applies only in the case of  
ascetics. His reason for doing so is evidently that he wishes the text to support  
the view that one should aspire to drop the Vaidika elements of one’s ritual pro 
gramme even if one is not an ascetic, seeing persistence in these as symptoms of  
a contracted state of mind that all Śaivas, householders included, should strive  
to transcend.47 
Nonetheless, it is unlikely that this Śākta-Śaiva view of the accommodation  
of Vaidika ritual had a negative impact on the integration of such Śaivas within  
Vaidika society. Kṣemarāja speaks here of an ideal adjustment within the largely  
private domain of the Śaiva householder’s daily ritual rather than a wholesale re 
jection of conformity in the socio-religious domain. And this is in line with other  
elements of transcendence that set the Śaivas engaged in Bhairava and goddess  
worship apart from the Saiddhāntikas. Thus, for example, when a Saiddhāntika  
participated in a collective meal with other initiates he was not to sit in a line that  
contained persons of a caste other than his own. If he did so he was to do penance,  
its severity determined by the degree of the caste difference, being doubled if the  
contaminator was a Vaiśya and trebled if he was a Śūdra.48 But according to the  
Svacchanda, the principal scripture of the non-Saiddhāntika Dakṣiṇa system of  
47. Kṣemarāja on Svacchanda 2.14c: ‘This veneration of the Juncture (sandhyāvandanam) is done with  
the Mantras of Śiva, but first it is done with the Mantras of [one’s] Veda. That is the duty of those in  
whom there lingers the deep-seated mentality of identification with the caste that was theirs [before  
they entered the casteless “caste” of Bhairava (bhairavajātiḥ) through initiation] (anivr̥ttaprāgjātivāsa naiḥ kāryam). The rest should do it with the Śaiva Mantras [alone], immediately after they have com pleted the ritual bath. As has been taught [by Śiva in Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṁgraha 7.9cd]: “He may or  
may not do the Vaidika [Sandhyā ritual]; but it is compulsory that he should do the Śaiva”.’ On the early  
Śākta-Śaiva attitude to caste, and other Vaidika dualities, such as that of the pure and the impure, see  
Sanderson 1985, pp. 198–205 and endnote 69; Sanderson 2009a, pp. 292–297; and Sanderson 2009b. 
48. Trilocanaśiva, Prāyaścittasamuccaya p. 25: ‘He should always avoid when eating sitting in the same  
line (ekapanktiḥ) as persons of a different caste (bhinnajātibhiḥ). A brahmin who eats unknowingly with  
persons of a Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, or Śūdra caste and abandons his meal in the middle as soon as he realizes  
this, should declare this, and then [as his penance] repeat the Aghoramantra ten, twenty, or thirty times  
respectively. If he realizes [what he has done only] after the meal has been finished [he should repeat  
it] one, two, or three hundred times respectively.’

Bhairava worship, initiates may be arranged in separate rows on such occasions  
only according to their rank as initiates. They must never separate themselves in  
accordance with the distinctions between the castes in which they were at the time  
of their initiation (prāgjātiḥ). They must see themselves as having become equal  
members of a single ‘caste’ of Bhairava (bhairavīyā jātiḥ), and they must know that  
if they make any reference to the former caste of an initiate they will be guilty  
of a sin that will lead them to hell. In short, says the text, if one wishes to attain  
one’s goal, be it salvation or Siddhi, one must be free of all caste discrimination  
(avivekī).49 But there is no suggestion that this transcendence of caste distinctions  
should be applied on the socio-religious level in such matters as marriage. The  
fact that Abhinavagupta cites the Sarvajñānottara with approval for its view of the  
necessity of general conformity, and does so even in the context of an argument  
that the considerations of relative purity and impurity that dominate Vaidika  
behaviour are subjective (pramātr̥dharmaḥ), makes clear that no such subversive  
transcendence was envisaged.50 
The same is the point of a Kaula verse cited by the Śākta-Śaiva Jayaratha in  
this context and also by the Smārta Aparāditya, though in that case with the con 
trary purpose of demonstrating the insincerity of the Śaivas’ conformity: 
He should be a Kaula in private (antaḥ kaulo), a Śaiva in outward appearance  
(bahiḥ śaivo), but a Vaidika in his mundane observances (lokācāre tu vaidikaḥ),  
keeping the essence [of his religion hidden behind these two outer layers], just  
as the coconut fruit [keeps its milk within its flesh, which in turn is enclosed  
by its hard outer shell].51

tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . . 
In the same spirit the Tārātantra, a text from the later East Indian Śākta tra 
dition, tells us concerning the orgiastic gathering of Śākta initiates known as a  
‘circle of Bhairavī’: 
Once the circle of Bhairavī has commenced (ārabdhe bhairavīcakre) all [the  
participants, whatever their] caste-classes are the best of brahmins (sarve var 
ṇā dvijottamāḥ). But as soon as it has ended each returns to his or her separate  
station. If a person, being deluded, makes distinctions of caste (jātibhedaṁ . . .  
karoti) within the sacred circle, then without doubt he will fall into a terrible  
hell from which it will be hard to escape.52 
A Śaiva-Vaidika Socio-Religious Hierachy  
under Royal Authority 
The Śaivas, then, advocated a two-tiered Śaiva-Vaidika socio-religious system,  
with the Vaidika subordinate to the Śaiva. To achieve this new order they ex 
erted themselves to secure the support of royal patrons, without which no such  
aspiration could be realised, and though the details of how they proceeded to this  
end in particular cases are mostly inaccessible to us now, epigraphical and other  
evidence reveals that they were successful in their endeavour in many parts of the  
subcontinent and Southeast Asia. 
It is at least clear from their prescriptive literature that they expanded their  
ritual repertoire to support this endeavour, by introducing a form of initiation  
for rulers that not only promised the benefit of liberation at death and, in this  
life, the heightening of the initiand’s temporal power, but also departed radically  
from tradition by exonerating the beneficiary from all the time-consuming and  
arduous ritual duties that were the usual consequence of initiation. A king who  
was devoted to Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ) could receive the prestige of initiation  
52. Tārātantra quoted in the Sarvollāsatantra, p. 80. I conjecture ārabdhe for ārambhe in the first

without any of its inconveniences, being required thereafter only to maintain the  
support of the faith that is the duty of any lay (uninitiated) devotee (śivabhaktaḥ,  
upāsakaḥ). 
The Saiddhāntikas also developed a Śaiva version of the royal consecration rit 
ual (rājyābhiṣekaḥ) to be given to a king after he had received this Śaiva initiation.  
The Naimittikakriyānusaṁdhāna of Brahmaśambhu, completed in ad 938/9,53 the  
earliest surviving guide to the Saiddhāntika Śaiva rituals, states that the purpose  
of this ceremony is to qualify the king for his office as the guide and guardian  
of the system of the castes and disciplines.54 This is none other than the role as 
signed to him by purely Vaidika authorities; 55 and accordingly the Mantra recited  
at the climax of this empowerment, as the water of consecration is poured, is not  
Mantramārgic but rather the long-established verse text of the (royal) consecra 
tion Mantra prescribed for this purpose by Varāhamihira in the first half of the  
sixth century on the authority of the Older Garga.56 But since it is as an initiated  
Śaiva that the king is to assume this role, it is evident that the socio-religious or 
der entrusted to his care is not just that envisaged by the Vaidika authorities but  
rather the expanded religion that comprised both the Vaidika and the Śaiva tra 
ditions. For the Śaiva literature elsewhere requires him to ensure that the strata  
of this complex of injunction are maintained in the proper order of relative au 
thority, with the Vaidika subordinate to the Śaiva, promising him that to do so  
53. Naimittikakriyānusaṁdhāna f. 103r–v2: ‘On the tenth day of the bright fortnight of the first month  
of autumn in the 860th year of the king of the Śakas I, disciple of the abbot of Mattamayūra, have de 
clared this procedure for initiation that adheres to the teaching of the Dviśata[kālottara] and should be  
given by a Guru to Gurus initiated in his own lineage to terminate his holding of his tenure of office.’ 
54. Naimittikakriyānusaṁdhāna f. 74v1 [4.118]: ‘I shall now teach in addition the consecration cere mony to empower an initiated king as the guide and guardian of the castes and disciplines (varṇānām  
āśramāṇāṁ ca gurubhāvāya bhūpateḥ | yo ’bhiṣekavidhiḥ so ’pi procyate dīkṣitātmanaḥ).’ See Sander son 2009a, p. 255, fn. 593.

‘taught by the Muni’ (47.51d: mantro ’tra munigītaḥ). It is his commentator Bhaṭṭa Utpala who in a com ment on this statement identifies the Muni as the Older Garga: munigīto muninā vr̥ddhagargeṇoktaḥ.

will guarantee him a long reign and the prosperity of his kingdom, and implying  
thereby that failing to do so will have the opposite consequences. 
We see all this clearly enunciated in a passage of the Mohacūrottara, one of  
a number of as yet unpublished scriptures of the Śaiva Mantramārga known as  
Pratiṣṭhātantras.57 
These texts, as their name indicates, are concerned to regulate the practice  
specific to the class of Mantramārgic Śaiva officiants known as Sthāpakas, who  
specialized in the installation (pratiṣṭhā) of temples, their images, and monaster ies, and in the planning of settlements and royal palaces, and the layout of the  
towns around them. After prescribing the proper disposition of the habitations  
of the various castes around the palace of an emperor (mahārājādhirājaḥ) it says: 
Tradition declares that the king is the protector of his subjects. Therefore it  
is right that he should protect the caste communities and ensure that they are  
instructed in their duties, each according to its station. The sources that con 
vey these duties are Śruti, Smr̥ti, Purāṇa, and the [Śaiva] scriptures (āgamāḥ).  
If the king abides by these he enjoys a long reign. [The correct order of author 
ity in which they should be applied is as follows.] The Vedas [comprising both  
Śruti and Smr̥ti] take precedence over the Purāṇas, and the [Śaiva] scrip tures take precedence over the teachings of the Vedas.58 There is the common  
[Vaidika authority of Śruti, Smr̥ti, and Purāṇa] (sāmānyam), and then there  
is the special (viśeṣam). The Śaiva [scriptures] (śaivam) are the latter. [So] the  
learned should not doubt their authority when they find that they conflict  
with [a Vaidika injunction]. The all-knowing [master] should adjudicate each  
case objectively [by this criterion]. Given the plurality of scriptural authori 
ties, whenever there is a question as to which of two [conflicting] statements  
takes precedence, he should adopt that which has been taught by Śiva. He  
57. On the canon of these texts see Sanderson 2014, pp. 26–27 and fn. 100. 
58. The Vedas here must be understood to include Smr̥ti, that is to say, the Dharmaśāstras, if this  
statement is not to contradict the preceding assertion that the (non-Śaiva) sources of the knowledge  
of duty are not only Śruti (the Vedas in the narrow sense) and Purāṇa but also Smr̥ti.

should reconcile the two, whether self-sufficient or depending for the under 
standing of their meaning on [examination in the light of] other sources of the  
same kind, related sources, and [, where they fail,] learned exegesis, by apply 
ing such modes of reasoning as presumption (arthāpattiḥ). Understand this, O  
Indra, and thereby attain the ultimate bliss. When the king understands the  
duties of religion in this way his realm will always prosper.59 
This model, in which the Vaidika ordinances are maintained under the aegis  
of Śaivism, might be suspected to have been more ideal than real were it to rest on  
this prescriptive evidence alone. However, it is in harmony with what is conveyed  
by the historical records of the period. They certainly do not support a position  
that the rise of Śaivism during these centuries led to a corresponding decline in  
the hold of the Vaidika order. On the contrary, they point to a renaissance in that  
sphere; and they show that Śaiva kings were active in promoting it. 
A good part of the inscriptions that have come to light from this time con 
sists of thousands of copperplate charters in which kings, including those who  
were Śaiva, have recorded their establishing Vaidika brahmins in their territories  
through grants of tax-exempt land, thus fulfilling one of the principal duties im 
posed on them by Vaidika scripture, extending the penetration of Vaidika ober 
vance, while facilitating the administration of their territories and promoting  
agricultural development. 
Further, numerous kings, Śaivas prominent among them, have been com 
mended during this period, particularly at its beginning, for having imposed the  
system of castes and disciplines (varṇāśramadharmaḥ) in their newly established  
kingdoms, this frequently being presented as a restoration after a period of de 
cline. 
Nor was this promotion of Brahmanism by Śaiva kings restricted to the socio 
religious level. It extended on occasion to the commissioning of the horse sacrifice  
(Aśvamedha) and other solemn (Śrauta) Vaidika rituals. These were associated  
with the acquisition and celebration of sovereignty; but their performance was

33211 Honoris Causa 3P.indd 182 11/18/15 5:22 PM
tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . . 
also a signal of a king’s desire to be seen as an exemplary supporter of the Veda,  
dedicated to the revival of Vaidika religion in its entirety. 
So the epigraphic record indicates that there were numerous Śaiva kings  
throughout our period who fully accepted their role as the guardians of the  
Vaidika social order and thus conducted themselves in matters of religion in the  
manner envisaged by Brahmaśambhu and the Mohacūḍottara. Indeed, in many  
cases their panegyrists have portrayed them as zealous propagators of that order,  
praising them for their efforts to reverse the decline in the hold of the Vaidika  
order on society.60 
The Loss of Transcendence 
This double religion, combining the Vaidika religion and Śaivism under royal  
authority, was from the point of view of all Śaiva theoreticians a two-tiered hi 
erarchy with Śaivism on top and the Vaidika religion below. The theoreticians’  
ahistorical and fundamentalist presentation depicts no overlap between the two  
levels, no encroachment of one upon the other, or rather it uses theory to outlaw  
any such encroachment. 
Nonetheless, when we see that the Vaidika domain has been so comprehen 
sively accommodated we are bound to look for evidence of a weakening of the  
orthoprax Vaidikas’ rejection of Śaivism and also of a commensurate adoption  
by Śaivas themselves of a view of their religion that surrendered the doctrine of  
its transcendence. We may well imagine Śaivas who had abandoned all sense of  
their religion as a path above the Vaidika, who saw themselves simply as Śaivas  
by birth, who claimed for their scriptures no more than that they apply to them  
as Śaivas, that there is nothing special about initiation, that it is merely a rite  
of passage into ritual activities peculiar to their group, and that these activities  
are much like the practices of other groups, Vaiṣṇava and orthoprax Vaidika, of  
similar social standing. 
60. Space prevents me from setting forth here the epigraphical evidence of the engagement of Śaiva  
kings in these efforts to promote Brahmanism in their kingdoms. It has been presented in detail in my  
forthcoming Śaivism and Brahmanism.

Jayanta 
We do indeed find evidence of both these developments. The earliest appears on the  
Vaidika side near the end of the ninth century in the Nyāyamañjarī of the Kashmirian  
philosopher Bhaṭṭa Jayanta, minister of king Śaṇkaravarman (r. c. ad 883–902) and  
author of the Āgamaḍambara, the humorous play about the religious tensions of the  
day that I have cited above. He states that he undertook the monumental Nyāya 
mañjarī in order to protect the authority of the Vedas; and this commitment is ap 
parent throughout.61 Yet he argues for the validity of the Śaiva scriptures: 62 
But as for the scriptures that we see which are other than [those of the Vedic  
corpus], they too are of two kinds. Some, such as those taught by the Buddha,  
are completely at odds with the Veda. But others, such as those taught by Śiva,  
are certainly not, merely teaching optional modes of religious observance that  
differ [from those of that corpus]. I declare that of these the scriptures [of  
the latter kind, those] taught by Śiva and [Viṣṇu,] are undoubtedly (tāvat) 
valid. This is (1) because we find in the cognitions that they produce none of  
the numerous defects that give rise [in other cases] to doubt or refutation,  
[and] (2) because we are unable to impute any of the motives such as greed and  
delusion that might otherwise explain their creation, since both Smr̥ti texts  
and inference establish that these too were authored by God (Īśvara). For we  
find in them no record of their having come into existence at a specific time  
[after the creation]; and we find in them, as in the Veda, numerous instances  
of ekadeśasaṁvādaḥ [, that is to say, of] ‘the verification of claims made in  
part [of the corpus’, claims which when they have been put to the test and  
61. Nyāyamañjarī, vol. 1, p. 7, ll. 6–9: ‘As for the system of the Nyāya taught by Akṣapāda, it is the cen tral pillar [that holds up the edifice] of all the other branches of learning. This because it is the means of  
safeguarding the authority of the Vedas. For if the Vedas have their authority overturned by the false  
reasonings authored by false philosophers, the commitment of the pious would slacken. Why then  
would they devote themselves to the task of putting its injunctions into practice, a task that among  
other things requires great expense and exertion if it is to be accomplished successfully?’

found effective evince confidence in the truth of its statements on matters that  
must be taken on trust]. So what scope remains for the postulation that they  
have some other source [such as human greed or ignorance]? Nor [, unlike the  
scriptures of the Buddhists and others,] do they stand in opposition to the  
Veda. For they do not abandon participation in the system of the four caste 
classes and [four life-disciplines] established by [the ordinances of] the Veda. 
The manner [in which we establish the validity] of the injunctions of  
Manu and the other [promulgators of secondary scripture] cannot  
apply to the Śaiva scriptural corpus. But that does not entail its in 
validity. [For] throughout its texts we find clear understanding of the  
well-known teachings of all the Upaniṣads pertaining to the ultimate  
goal. Moreover, even the foremost of those who have mastered the  
Veda, such as Kr̥ṣṇadvaipāyana, support the view that the teachings  
of the Śaiva scriptures and [the like] are valid. And he has taught that  
this validity also applies to [the corpus of Vaiṣṇava texts called] the  
Pañcarātra. For they too contain nothing that requires us to dismiss  
them as devoid of authority.63 
Moreover, they contain the declaration that Lord Viṣṇu is their author; and  
he is just God himself (Īśvara) [under another name]. 
Because one beginningless soul with infinite power, the wondrous  
(kasyacit) cause of the creation of the entire universe, undertakes the  
[three] distinct tasks of creating the world, holding it in existence, and  
withdrawing it [again at the end of each cycle], it has come to be per 
ceived as [three distinct deities:] Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra. 
Furthermore, at various places within the Veda we have the texts ‘Rudra  
alone remained. There was no second’ (eka eva rudro ’va tasthe na dvitīyaḥ)  
63. He refers to Kr̥ṣṇadvaipāyana, alias Vyāsa, as the author of the Mahābhārata, which does indeed  
assert this validity in the Mokṣadharma provided that one understands the term pāśupatam to refer in  
the meaning ‘that taught by Paśupati’ (following Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.3.101: tena proktam) to Śaivism in general  
rather than specifically to the Pāśupata system. He anachronistically includes under that heading the  
Saiddhāntika Śaiva scriptures, and accepts, as some did not, that the passage authorizes not just the  
study of these texts but also the enacting of their injunctions. 
185 
33211 Honoris Causa 3P.indd 185 11/18/15 5:22 PM
Honoris Causa 
and ‘Viṣṇu strode out over [all] this’ (idaṁ viṣṇur vi cakrame); and means of  
union with these [deities], [that is to say] methods for their propitiation, are  
certainly enjoined in the Veda too. As for the methods taught in the Śaiva  
scriptures and the Pañcarātra, they are certainly different; but this does not  
amount to an [invalidating] contradiction of the Veda, because these [various]  
methods [Vaidika, Śaiva, and Pāñcarātrika] are alternatives from which one  
is free to choose. So these two [bodies of scripture, the Śaiva and the Pañ 
carātra,] are not invalid, because they have been composed by a competent  
authority [namely God himself] and because they do not contradict the Veda. 
Here, then, is a view that has accepted much of the Saiddhāntikas’ own ar 
gument for the validity of their scriptures, namely (1) the evidence of compliance  
with Vaidika ordinances, a feature that Jayanta takes to differentiate them mark 
edly from such teachings as those of the ‘Veda-rivalling’ Buddhists, which, as he  
claims shortly after the passage quoted here, actually forbid adherence to to these  
ordinances; 64 and (2) that of validation by the Vaidika scriptures themselves. In 
deed it appears, if Cakradhara’s commentary on the Nyāyamañjarī expresses a  
widely held view, that in this aspect the Naiyāyika defense of the Śaiva scriptures  
had actually attempted to strengthen the case made by the Śaivas themselves  
by claiming that even the ceremony of Śaiva initiation (dīkṣā), the centrepiece of  
the Mantramārga’s bid to be considered superior to the religion of the Veda and  
for this very reason one of the principal grounds for its rejection by the theoreti 
cians of Vaidika orthopraxy, has been validated by the unquestionable evidence  
of Vaidika scripture.65 
64. Nyāyamañjarī-Āgamaprāmāṇya, p. 154, l. 31 to p. 155, l. 1: ‘For in the case of the teachings of the  
Buddha their being outside the Veda is fully manifest, since they stress that one should avoid behaving  
in keeping with the duties imposed by the caste in which one was born.’ Jayanta refers to the Buddhists  
and others as ‘Veda-rivalling’, p. 197 [156], l. 6: vedaspardhino bauddhādayo niṣeddhavyāḥ. 
65. Cakradhara, Nyāyamañjarīgranthibhaṅga, p. 379, ll. 21–23: ‘Showing in the Dānadharma [of the  
Śāntiparvan of the Mahābhārata] that Upamanyu taught Kr̥ṣṇa the dīkṣā taught in those teachings he  
has made this validity of the Śaiva scriptures clear.’ He has in mind here Mahābhārata 13.15.4ab: ‘And  
on the eighth day I was duly initiated (dīkṣito ’haṁ yathāvidhi) by that learned brahmin.’ This is in fact a  
spurious argument, since Dīkṣā here is not Śaiva initiation but ‘[a period of] ascetic restraint’ (syn. vra

tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . . 
A significant part of the Saiddhāntika defense of their system is lacking here,  
namely Sadyojyotis’s argument that the Śaiva scriptures presuppose the validity  
of the Veda to the extent that Śaivism collapses if that presupposition is not de 
fended, which is to say that for the Śaivas the proof of the validity of scripture  
(āgamaprāmāṇyam) must of necessity encompass both the Śaiva and the Vaidika  
corpora. Evidently that is because the acceptance of this argument is incompat 
ible with even the most tolerant Vaidika view, since it is inseparably connected  
with the doctrine that Śaivism is superior to the faith of the Veda, accepting the  
validity of the Veda in its sphere only because it needs to believe that its initiation  
is liberating the soul from real bonds. 
It is in the same spirit, I propose, that Jayanta puts forward here the vague  
and inaccurate claim that the teachings of the Śaiva scriptures are consistent with  
those of the Vaidika Upaniṣads. 
This in short is a view that accommodates the religion of the Śaivas but over 
looks what makes that religion unique in their own estimation, choosing not to see  
the respects in which the teachings of the Śaivas differ from those of the Vaiṣṇava  
and Vaidika traditions in matters of metaphysics and soteriology, even though  
some of these positions bear strongly on their sense of identity and purpose. The  
price of recognition, then, is that the Śaivas must accept a watered-down version  
of themselves, one in which they are no longer the inheritors of a uniquely effica 
cious vehicle of salvation, but subscribers to an ecumenism that argues that there  
is but one god with many forms and names teaching various paths that lead to  
the same goal. They are invited in other words to see themselves as just another  
equipolent component of the complex that would come to be called Hinduism. 
We might be tempted to see this view of Śaivism as idiosyncratic. It certainly  
does not seem to to be found in the work of any other Vaidika authority of this  
tam), a common usage in that text; see, e.g., 2.16.13c: ‘emaciated because of his Dīkṣā’ (dīkṣākr̥śatanuḥ);  
5.118.7abc: ‘having reduced her body with various kinds of fasting, with Dīkṣās, and restraints’ (upavā saiś ca vividhair dīkṣābhir niyamais tathā | ātmano laghutāṁ kr̥tvā); and 13.130.50ab: ‘having observed  
the Dīkṣā for twelve years’ (cīrtvā dvādaśa varṣāṇi dīkṣām).

period.66 However, Jayanta himself blocks this line of thought by stating categor 
ically that his position is that of the greater society (mahājanaḥ), which he defines  
as all who live in Āryadeśa within the boundaries of the system of the four caste 
classes and four life-disciplines in accordance with the ordinances of the Veda; 67 
it is the consensus of this community which for him constitutes the true arbiter  
of orthopraxy and therefore of scriptural validity; and this community, he says,  
currently accepts as valid not only the Vedas and the secondary Vaidika scrip 
tures that follow in their wake, but also such other scriptural corpora as are not  
in opposition to the Vedas, namely the Śaiva and the Pañcarātra.68 
66. It has been claimed by Svāmī Yogīndrānanda, the editor of the Nyāyabhūṣaṇa, that the validity of the  
Śaiva scriptures was also defended by its author Bhāsarvajña (fl. c. 900), Jayanta’s near-contemporary  
and fellow-Naiyāyika (Introduction, p. 19: śaivagranthānāṁ prāmāṇyaṁ pratanoti). But this is based on  
a misunderstanding of Nyāyabhūṣaṇa, p. 402, ll. 6–10. The form and terms of Bhāsarvajña’s argument  
in this passage are in fact largely lifted from the Buddhist Dharmakīrti’s auto-commentary on 1.246 of  
his Pramāṇavārttika. Bhāsarvajña, like Dharmakīrti admits that Śaiva Mantras, like any other Mantras,  
produce supernatural effects (siddhiḥ). But he neither states nor implies that the scriptures that teach  
them are valid. 
67. The term Āryadeśa ‘the territory of the Āryas’ in this context does not denote a particular region  
of India. Rather it refers to all regions within which the system of the four caste-classes and disciplines  
has been established, as opposed to mlecchadeśaḥ, ‘the territory of the barbarians’, where it has not.  
Consider, for example, Abhinavagupta, Tantrasāra, p. 133: ‘as the regions of the Āryas are for the ad 
herents of the religion and the regions of the barbarians are for those outside it’ (āryadeśā iva dhār 
mikāṇāṁ mlecchadeśā iva adhārmikāṇām); and Nyāyamañjarī vol. 1, p. 595, ll. 11–12: ‘Or rather the [true]  
meaning of words is that established in Āryadeśa. Any other meaning, accepted by the barbarians, is  
certainly to be disregarded’ (athavā āryadeśaprasiddha eva śabdānām arthaḥ. itaras tu mlecchajana sammato ’nādaraṇīya eva). This distinction between Ārya and Mleccha is cultural rather than racial.  
The term mlecchabhāṣāḥ‘languages of the barbarians’ refers not only to foreign languages, such as  
those of India’s Śaka and Hūṇa invaders, but also to the Dravidian and other non-Indo-Aryan languages  
of the subcontinent. But the regions in which these languages were spoken were not mlecchadeśāḥ where the system of the four caste-classes and disciplines had been established, as was the case in the  
Dravidian-language regions during our period, at least in the nuclear regions of the various states that  
flourished there. Abhinavagupta, we may presume, did not consider the brahmins of the Tamil region  
who were his contemporaries to be Mlecchas bereft of religion. 
68. Nyāyamañjarī-Āgamaprāmāṇya, p. 156, ll. 14–15: ‘By the greater society (mahājanaḥ) I mean this  
population established in Āryadeśa comprising all those within the four caste-classes and the four  
life-disciplines’; p. 197 (156), ll. 1–4: ‘Only when [a body of scripture] has the support of general ac 
ceptance by the orthoprax consensus can one say without difficulty that it is the teaching of a trust 
worthy source; and the orthoprax consensus recognizes as valid (1) the Vedas, (2) the Purāṇas and

tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . . 
I see no reason to doubt the accuracy of this report of the current state of belief  
in the Vaidika community. Jayanta offers no statistics, as he himself admits; 69 but  
this would have been a very weak argument indeed if the evidence adduced were  
manifestly contrary to what his audience could see for themselves. It is more reason 
able to think that Jayanta is simply attempting to move Vaidika doctrine forward  
from its long-established theoretical position on the subject of the non-Vaidika  
traditions to take account of a change that had occurred in the lived relationship  
between the orthoprax and both Śaivism and Pāñcarātrika Vaiṣṇavism in the cen turies since the emergence and development of the Mantramārga. 
As for what he means to include under the rubric of the valid Śaiva scriptures,  
it is clear, though not explicit, that he has in mind only the Saiddhāntika form of  
the Mantramārga. For elsewhere he strongly condemns those forms of religion  
whose practices violate Vaidika norms of purity and permitted conduct. Thus,  
after arguing for the validity of the Śaiva scriptures, to which he refers without  
differentiation simply as Śaiva,70 he turns to those forms of religion that he judges  
to be invalid. After dismissing Buddhism, he attacks the obscure Saṁsāramo 
Dharmaśāstras that follow their lead, and (3) some scriptures [namely those of the Śaiva canon and  
the Pañcarātra] that are not in contradiction with the Vedas, but not those, such as that taught by the  
Buddha, which do contradict them.’ 
69. Debating the matter with an imaginary Buddhist, Jayanta has told him that Buddhism is invalid be 
cause it is not accepted by the greater society (mahājanaḥ). The Buddhist then asks rhetorically, ‘What  
is this “greater society”; what is its form; where is it located; how big is its population; and what are  
its customs?’ and adds that in any case the Buddhists have their own “greater society” consisting of  
their own co-religionists. Jayanta then admits that he has no physical or quantitative data concerning  
this greater society. He cannot describe the physical appearance of its members or their total num 
ber (ākāras tu tasya kīdr̥śaḥ pāṇipādaṁ kīdr̥śaṁ śirogrīvaṁ vā kīyatī tasya saṁkhyeti puruṣalakṣaṇāni  
gaṇayituṁ na jānīmaḥ). But he does know that its values are pervasive, to the extent that the Buddhists  
themselves are unable to escape them, since they too avoid untouchables, and those (the Śākta Śaivas)  
who indulge in orgiastic rites do so covertly, not fully believing in the rightness of their transgressive  
actions; see Nyāyamañjarī-Āgamaprāmāṇya, p. 156, l. 8 to p. 157, l. 10. For the Buddhist prohibition  
against the ordination of untouchables see Guṇaprabha’s commentary on Vinayasūtra-Pravrajyāvastu,  
p. 151: ‘One should not ordain as monks chariot-makers, tanners, Caṇḍālas, Pukkaśas, and the like’ (na  
rathakāra[carmakāra]caṇḍālapukkaśatadvidhān pravrājayet).

suffering]’),71 and then goes on to say: 72 
How can anyone bring himself even to mention the question of the validity  
of those systems whose rites are dominated by engagement in the forbidden? 
which his commentator Cakradhara takes, no doubt correctly, to be an allusion  
to the Bhairava Śaivism of the Right Stream (dakṣiṇasrotaḥ), since to illustrate  
Jayanta’s point he quotes a verse that declares that the impurities of the body are  
considered pure in that system.73 Then, condemning the relativistic argument that  
no system should be judged by any standards other than its own, Jayanta states: 74 
As for those others, who practice various impermissible forms of post 
initiatory observance (dīkṣā) that [claim to] transcend inhibiting duality  
(nirvikalpa-) through such means as eating the impure and having sexual in 
tercourse with forbidden partners, [they evidently lack the strength of their  
professed conviction, because] they do not do these things openly but act in  
secret, shying away from the majority that abides by the rules that govern  
the four caste-classes and life-disciplines. For if their faith in their scriptures  
is so free of doubt why do they put their teachings into practice like thieves  
[avoiding detection]. 
Here he attacks what can only be Śākta-Śaiva traditions of the Kaula type.  
For the use of the term nirvikalpa- in the special sense that we see here, namely  
free of doubt, free of inhibition, or free of duality, in the sense of being free of dis

crimination between the permitted and the forbidden, is a hallmark of the Śākta 
leaning non-Saiddhāntika and Kaula literature.75 Moreover, the passage brings  
to mind others in the Kashmirian literature of this period which use the same  
idiom in describing the activities of the Kaulas, such as the satirist Kṣemendra’s  
description of women in the initiatory circle of a fictional Kaula Guru: 76 
Once initiated by that libertine Guru [and Guru of libertines] (jāraguruṇā)  
those beauties would make love with all and sundry, faithfully adhering to the  
non-dualistic observance (nirvikalpavrate sthitāḥ).

ety that will herald the descent of Kalkin, Viṣṇu’s tenth Avatāra: 77 
[At that time] the Gurus teach that liberation is attained in a circle gathering  
with dyers of cloth, weavers, tanners, cremation-ground attendants (kāpā 
lika-), and other such persons of the service-castes (-śilpibhiḥ), by drinking  
[wine] from a single vessel with them and holding an ecstatic orgy of non

The Guru, by teaching forbidden [religious] practices to that [king], who was  
already wicked by nature, abolished in him all consciousness of the distinction  
between permitted and forbidden sexual partners, and he himself engaged  
in sexual intercourse without inhibition even with his own daughter. What  
greater evidence of the freedom from duality (gatavikalpatvam) 80 achieved by  
this Guru could I provide? 
Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II’s Śaivas without Pride of Transcendence 
Having established that Jayanta’s view of Saiddhāntika Śaivism as a valid from of  
religion is unlikely to have been a minority view in the general Vaidika population  
outside Śaiva circles, we must wonder whether it is likely that this view could  
have been as general as he says it was in the absence of Śaivas who subscribed to  
it themselves. 
There are indeed indications that an ideologically emasculated Śaivism of the  
kind outlined by Jayanta did exist and therefore that the great Kashmirian Naiyā 
yika was indeed expressing the view of an already established segment of the Śai 
vas themselves. Furthermore, we may suspect that this had become the majority  
view among them, and that the learned theories of the Śaiva theologians, which  
demonstrate how Śaivism is superior to the Vaidika religion, how its rituals and  
meditations work on an altogether higher level and its doctrines penetrate far be 
yond the reach of its rival, were not so much articulations of established, common  
belief as fundamentalist attempts to revitalize and recover a tradition that was fast  
losing a sense of its original calling. Thus Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha, writing in the tenth  
century, when Saiddhāntika learning in Kashmir was at its height, tells us that one  
of his reasons for writing his commentary on the Saiddhāntika scripture Mataṅga 
pārameśvara was to counteract attempts to draw the understanding of the text  
into the Vaidika domain, by going back to the foundational doctrines of Sadyo 
jyotis and Br̥haspati and sweeping away what he saw as the inauthentic interpre tations of the Siddhānta that had developed since the time of these two founding  
80. This expression gatavikalpatvam equals nirvikalpatvam, i.e., ‘being nirvikalpaḥ.’

fathers of Saiddhāntika exegesis.81 And he confirms that this loss of identity was  
well advanced when he targets for criticism the view of some at least of his Śaiva  
co-religionists that the execution of their regular rituals of worship was merely  
the fulfilment of a duty, with no higher purpose than conformity to scriptural  
injunction, which is to say, the view of Śaivas who had abandoned a properly Śaiva  
perspective and substituted that of the Mīmāṁsaka theorists of Vaidika ritual: 82 
Now, for what purpose do we do [our obligatory Śaiva] rituals, time-fixed and  
[incidental]? Some say that our engagement in these is entirely without pur 
pose, [that we do them simply] because they are enjoined [by our scriptures],  
just as the Mīmāṁsakas [hold with regard to their own obligatory rituals].  
That is not correct; because [the two cases, the Vaidika and Śaiva,] are differ 
ent. For the [Mīmāṁsakas] hold that [their] scriptures are valid because they  
are not the product of any conscious being [but are an eternal self-existent  
body of injunctions that minds can perceive but have not created]. So they  
may well formulate such a view. But in our system [our scriptures are held  
to be valid] as the work of all-knowing [God]. So how can [we believe that]  
he could teach something that has no purpose? Or rather, if he does so then  
he must be comparable to an imbecile or madman and therefore, being non 
omniscient, not worthy of our regard, with the undesired consequence that  
our scriptures would be invalid.83

For the theses, supported by these verses, (1) that Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha saw his mission as that of re turning the Siddhānta to its original purity, freeing it from orthoprax Vaidika and Śākta influences, and

and Brhaspati, c. ad 650–750, and the next surviving works, from tenth-century Kashmir, see Sander

Aparāditya’s Śaivas by Birth 
A comparable situation is revealed by Aparāditya, the Śilāhāra king of North  
Konkan, writing in the early twelfth century, through one of the Śaiva arguments  
for acceptability that he puts up to refute in in his commentary on Yājñavalkya 
smr̥ti. The Śaiva is made to argue that since the adherents of the Vaidika religion  
hold that the injunctive force of the Veda is directed only to specific, restricted  
classes of persons, they can have no reason to deny that the Śaiva scriptures are  
valid for Śaivas as members of a similar community of birth, which suggests that  
its members, when asked why they engage in their special Śaiva rituals, would  
have responded like Georg Bühler’s Śaiva brahmin informants in Kashmir in 1875  
that they attached no special importance to them but did them because this was  
the long-established custom of their community.84 Aparāditya responds by at 
tacking the very notion that it is possible to be a Śaiva by birth (jātyā), to be, as it  
were, a member of a caste of Śaivas. 
He does so in the course of his commentary on 1.7, which details the means  
that enable men to know their religious duty (dharmamūlam) – namely Śruti,  
Smr̥ti, observable orthopraxy (sadācāraḥ), and, within the limits set by these,  
mental satisfaction, enabling one, for example, to decide that one is now ready  
to end a course of ascetic observance, and personal preference, in such matters  
as choosing the time at which to perform some pious action – taking this oppor 
tunity to examine the objection that this list wrongly omits the Śaiva, Pāśupata,  
Pāñcarātrika, and other (unspecified) scriptural corpora. 
The initial proposition is that these corpora have as good a claim as the Vaid 
ika to be accepted, because they too are eternal revelation, and that therefore  
the highest good will be attained by enacting their injunctions. Aparāditya then  
counters by insisting that this cannot apply to orthoprax Vaidikas, because the  
Śaiva scriptures teach that the Vaidika rites are inefficacious when they say, as we  
have seen, that these rituals are enjoined on Śaivas not because of their efficacity  
but because by doing them in addition to their Śaiva rites Śaivas will ingratiate  
84. See Bühler 1877, p. 24, and the discussion of the view that he reports in Sanderson 1995, pp. 37–38,  
and 2007b, pp. 110–112.

themselves with those who, in the Śaiva perspective, are not yet ready for the  
higher system.85 
He next addresses a passage from the Devīpurāṇa that condemns to torture  
in hell those who despise either the teaching of Śiva or the Vedas, and a passage  
from the Yogayājñavalkya86 which includes ‘the teachings of Paśupati’ (pāśupa 
tam) in a list of those that one is forbidden to challenge with logical argument.  
He argues that these passages merely prohibit condemnation and permit study  
and do not allow the inference that one is also permitted to put their injunctions  
into practice; 87 and he provides several reasons that block that inference, the most  
significant of which is perhaps that if a person were to take Śaiva initiation, as  
he would have to do if he intended to enact the Śaiva injunctions, he would be  
punished with hell, according to the Śaiva scriptures, if he had a Vaidika Śrāddha  
ceremony performed for him.88 The unstated point of this, I propose, is that he  
thereby provides a refutation of the Śaivas’ claim that their scriptures are accept 
able because they require their initiates to adhere rigidly to Vaidika regulations  
and so are not contrary to the Veda (vedaviruddha-). For while it is true that they  
were enjoined to undergo all the Vaidika rites of qualification (samṣkārāḥ) prior to  
their initiation, namely up to upanayanam or marriage, following the procedures  
laid down in the Gr̥hyasūtra of their branch of the Veda, one major rite of passage  
remained, namely cremation (antyeṣtiḥ), and the various rites of offerings to the  
deceased thereafter. For these the Śaivas developed their own rituals and it was  
these that had to be followed in the case of the initiated.89

officiants in Kashmir for cremation and the post-mortuary Śrāddha ceremonies are of two kinds. In  
one the Śaiva procedures alone are given. In the other we find both the Vaidika and the Śaiva, the  
two proceeding in tandem from phase to phase with the Vaidika element always preceding the Śaiva.  
This hybrid, which is not envisaged in the Śaiva Paddhatis of pan-Indian authority, is likely to have  
been introduced precisely out of anxiety that omitting the Vaidika procedures might have a negative  
195

It is at this point that he moves on to address the proposition that the Śaiva  
scriptures are valid as ordinances for the Śaivas as members of a distinct commu 
nity entered at birth: 90 
Can it not be conceded that just as the Vedas and [Smr̥tis] apply to only  
certain specific persons [defined by their birth] so the Śaiva and other [non 
Vaidika] scriptures [are valid because they] are for Śaivas and others as per 
sons who are members of specific communities[, Śaiva or other,] that they  
have entered through birth? No, it cannot. This is because in passages such  
as ‘No persons other than those for whom all the rites from conception to  
cremation with [the Veda’s] Mantras have been prescribed are qualified for  
this teaching’ Manu and other [promulgators of Smr̥ti texts] have given us  
evidence only of the qualification of brahmins[, Kṣatriyas,] and [Vaiśyas] for  
their teachings but not of the qualification of ‘Śaiva brahmins’ and the like for  
corpora of scriptures taught by Śiva and others. Then let it be conceded that  
Śūdras [at least] are qualified to enact the teachings of Śiva[, since they have  
no access to the Veda and its Mantras and so fall outside Manu’s definition  
of those who are qualified and obliged to enact his teachings]. But that too we  
will not concede, because no Smr̥ti or any other [Vaidika scriptural source]  
accepts this. Furthermore, there is in fact no such person as a Śaiva by birth  
(jātyā) to whom the Śaiva scriptures could apply. For the word śaivaḥ ‘Śaiva’  
[means simply] ‘one who studies or understands the scriptures taught by Śiva’.  
[This is established by the semantic conditions governing the formation of the  
word śaivaḥ from śivaḥ through śaivam according to the grammatical rules of  
consequence. See for an example of the hybrid form the Kashmirian manuscript Vaidikatāntrikasa 
maṣṭividhinā (samaṣṭi em. : samiṣṭi Cod.) ekoddiṣṭaśrāddhavidhiḥ (ekoddiṣṭa em. : ekoddiṣṭe Cod.), ‘The  
ritual of the Ekoddiṣṭa Śrāddha following the procedure in which Vaidika and Tāntrika [Paddhatis] are  
combined.’ This is how the work is identified in its final colophon. At its beginning we read atha vaid 
ikatāntrika ekoddiṣṭakaranavidhiḥ (ekoddiṣṭa em : ekoddiṣṭe Cod.), ‘Next the ritual for performing the  
Ekoddiṣṭa [Śrāddha] that is [both] Vaidika and Tāntrika.’

derivation. Thus] by applying the suffix -a to [the name] śivaḥ ‘Śiva’ we form  
[the derivative noun] śaivam in the meaning ‘that which has been taught by  
Śiva’, that is to say, the corpus of Śaiva scriptures; and we then form the word  
śaivaḥ (‘a Śaiva’) from this in the meaning ‘one who understands or studies  
those scriptures’, the same suffix -a being added after the word śaivam in ac 
cordance with the rule ‘[-a after N in the sense] “one who studies N, one who  
understands N” and then elided by the rule “substitution of zero [for -a in  
the meaning “one who studies N, one who understands N” when that suffix  
comes] after [a word that has already been formed by the addition of the affix  
-a in the meaning] “taught [by N].” Pāśupata and other [words of this kind,  
such as Bauddha, Kāpila, Kāṇāda, Vaiṣṇava, Jaina, etc.] are formed in the  
same way [to mean “one who studies or understands what has been taught by  
Paśupati,” and so on].” 91 So the Śaiva and analogous bodies of scripture func 
tion without having naturally fixed social groups to ground them; and from  
this it follows that they are analogous to pictures [drawn] in the air. This being  
the case, they must certainly be rejected [as sources of valid knowledge] in [the  
domain of] religious practice. 
The view whose prevalence is attested by this attack would have been equally  
unacceptable to the likes of Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II and Abhinavagupta, though  
for the very different reason that it reveals a complete surrender of the properly  
Śaiva view that Śaivism is a universal revelation, reaching anyone whom Śiva  
deems ready to be liberated, regardless of such incidentals as region, caste, or  
lineage.92 
91. The grammmatical rules that Aparāditya applies here are Pāṇini, Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.3.101, 4.2.59, and  
4.2.64. 
92. Note in this context the commonly expressed Śaiva doctrine that division by birth into castes is  
an artificial construct that overlays and obscures the unity of humanity. For text and translation of text  
passages, both Saiddhāntika and non-Saiddhāntika, that express this conviction see Sanderson 2009a,

Hinduism 
It is entirely reasonable to claim in the light of this evidence that a complex corre 
sponding roughly to what would come to be called Hinduism was already recog 
nized, though not yet named, around the turn of the ninth and tenth centuries.  
At this juncture Jayanta assures us that the orthoprax majority had conceded  
that the Vaiṣṇavism of the Pañcarātra and the non-transgressive forms of Śaivism  
(therefore excluding those of the Bhairavatantras and Kulamārga) were valid and  
that communities that followed them were acceptable co-religionists; and we have  
seen evidence that Jayanta’s portrayal of these systems was not merely an out 
sider’s projection: it corresponded to the way in which what was probably the  
great majority of Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva adherents had come to see themselves, by  
surrendering the doctrines that were intended to keep alive their sense of tran 
scendence. This change of perspective, moreover, is one that is certainly more  
tolerant of diversity than the strictly Śaiva, which admitted only a hierarchy in  
which other vehicles of salvation, Vaidika and Vaiṣṇava, are subordinate to it.  
Here we have rather the view that the Vaidika, Vaiṣṇava, and Śaiva paths are  
options determined by inherited practice leading to a single Vaidika goal. It must  
be kept in mind, however, that this congeries of equipolent options was never the  
whole of Indian religious awareness in this period. Learned scholars among the  
Śaivas and Śākta-Śaivas strove by various strategies to keep alive in initiates the  
scripturally sanctioned belief that their Śaiva practices were not just a variant of a  
single accommodating religion but something which had the power to lead them  
to an ultimate goal that far transcended what either the Vaidika or the Vaiṣṇava  
system could reach, and Vaidika ideologues such as Aparāditya held out to the  
bitter end against this trend to accept what from their point of view was forbid 
den religious practice following false scriptures. 
Religion and the State: A Maximally Tolerant View  
of What Is Acceptable in Matters of Religion 
In Jayanta’s play Āgamaḍambara we have seen the uncompromising Vaidika camp  
attempt and fail to impose its Manu-inspired vision of a society free of all but  
properly Vaidika religion. When the suppression of an extreme fringe cult leads  
to panic among the Śaivas, the king, a Śaiva himself, not necessarily an initiate

but a publicly declared loyal devotee of Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ),93 who had at  
the beginning of his reign founded temples for the installation of Śivas whose  
names incorporated those of himself (Śaṇkaragaurīśvara) 94 and his chief queen  
(Sugandheśvara), intervenes and ensures that the status quo is maintained. The  
play ends with an orchestrated debate between the Vaidikas and the preceptors  
of the other faiths held in the Vaiṣṇava Raṇasvāmin temple in Srinagar on the  
subject of whether the Pañcarātra and the scriptures of the other non-Vaidika  
systems are or are not valid. In front of an audience of thousands, including the  
former Snātaka Saṁkarṣaṇa, now turned ultra-tolerant minister of religious  
affairs,95 the Naiyāyika Sāhaṭa, also called Dhairyarāśi, appointed as adjudictor  
by the order of the king himself (nr̥pādeśāt), hears the various disputants put their  
cases and then delivers his judgement. In this he rejects the narrow Vaidika view  
of validity and advocates one with the greatest latitude, stopping short only of ap 
proving transgressive, licentious, and violent cults such as were certainly present  
in Kashmir and elsewhere at this time. This view goes even beyond that enun 
ciated above to recognize that not only Vaiṣṇavism and Śaivism but also Bud dhism and Jainism are valid and must therefore be tolerated, holding that there  
is a single omniscient and nameless deity who in consideration of the differing  
intellectual dispositions of human beings has manifested himself variously as the  
propagators of all faiths: as Śiva, Paśupati, Kapila, Viṣṇu, Saṁkarṣaṇa, the Jina,  
93. Āgamaḍambara, prose between 3.3 and 3.4; prose before 4.2. He is also described there to the  
same effect as puraharahr̥dayasya ‘one whose heart is given to the destoyer of the [three] celestial  
palaces’ (prose after 4.6). 
94. Kalhaṇa, Rājataraṅgiṇī 5.156–158. The two Śivas were installed in his new capital Śaṇkarapura or  
Śaṇkarapattana (now Pattan/Paṭan in the Baramulla district of Kashmir), which he founded with his  
own name after coming to the throne. The two temples survive in ruins beside the road that runs from  
Srinagar to Baramulla, approximately equidistant from both. 
95. Saṁkarṣaṇa, who in the first part of the play was the champion of the view that all non-Vaidika  
views are invalid, is described by the Vaidika officiant who earlier lamented Saṁkarṣaṇa’s failure to  
push this view through, when he catches sight of him in this gathering of the learned, as a champion of  
the view that all (established) religions are valid; see the prose after 4.4: ‘We have direct experience  
of the power of Saṁkarṣaṇa [in this matter]. For he [has become] an adherent of the doctrine of the  
authoritativeness of all the religions’ (dr̥ṣṭaḥ saṁkarṣaṇapratāpaḥ. sa hi sarvāgamaprāmāṇyavādī).

the Buddha, and Manu.96 The only criteria of validity from this point of view are  
expressed as follows: 97 
This path of validation cannot be applied to any [tradition regardless of its  
character], but only to religious systems that meet the following criteria:  
(1)  they must have an unbroken tradition known to all; (2) the community  
of the orthoprax (āryalokaḥ) must not be loth to be acquainted with them or  
speak about them; (3) the practices that they advocate must not be beyond  
the pale of [what is acceptable to] society (janabāhyam); and (4) must not en 
danger [its members] (sabhayam); (5) their character must not be manifestly  
new-fangled (na rūpaṁ yeṣāṁ sphurati navam abhyutthitam iva); (6) they must  
not have the appearance of the teachings of madmen (pramattagītatvam);  
(7) they must not be teachings of Kaulas (akaulikatvam); 98 and (8) their source  
must not be greed or any other [base motive] (lobhādi). 
This position that all religious traditions (sarvāgama-) are entitled to be con 
sidered valid, if they meet the above criteria, is presented in theistic terms. A  
nameless supreme being is declared to have taught these various religions by as 
suming the form of their promulgators. However, it is clear that this dresses up in  
religious language what is in effect a juridical and political view of what the state  
should tolerate. The issue on this level is not truth or falsity but legality and the  
policy to be followed by the state in its role as guardian of the boundaries of the  
permissible, or rather, to use the monarchical language used by our authors, by  
the king in his role as the guardian and guide of the entire socio-religious order  
(sarvavarṇāśramaguruḥ) or, to use a phrase favoured by Jayanta, the king as the  
96. Āgamaḍambara 4.57. These are in order the propagators of the Śaiva, Pāśupata, Sāṁkhya,  
Vaiṣṇava, Pāñcarātrika, Jaina, and Buddhist systems, and the core Smr̥ti of the Vaidika tradition. 
97. Āgamaḍambara 4.100–101. 
98. I have tentatively conjectured the reading akaulikatvam here in place of the manuscripts’ alauki 
katvam because the latter nonsensically excludes from acceptance any tradition that is not mundane  
(laukika-). As we have seen, Śaṇkaravarman’s minister Jayanta was uncompromising in his condemna 
tion of Kaula practice, but it is nonetheless surprising that this list should make so specific an exclusion.

authoritative judge (-acāryaḥ) of the boundaries (maryādā) of religious conduct  
(dharmaḥ) within that order.99 
However, the king’s role was not merely to police these boundaries. It was also  
to promote the peaceful co-existence of the faiths through even-handed patron 
age. During our period the publicly declared personal religious commitment of  
kings, in addition to their commitment to preserve the Vaidika socio-religious  
order, generally took the form of devotion to Śiva, Viṣṇu, the Sun-God (Sūrya,  
Āditya), or the Goddess (Bhagavatī), the deities of the new initiatory religions, or  
to the Buddha (Sugata, Tathāgata) of Buddhism or the Arhats of Jainism, these  
allegiances being commonly announced in their inscriptions by the inclusion  
amid their royal titles of epithets that mean ‘entirely (parama-, atyanta-, param)  
devoted’ to whichever of these deities or religious founders they favoured. Thus  
devout worshippers of Śiva/Maheśvara are identified as paramamāheśvaraḥ,  
atyantamāheśvaraḥ, or paramaśaivaḥ; of Viṣṇu as paramabhāgavataḥ, parama vaiṣṇavaḥ, or atyantabhagavadbhaktaḥ; of the Sun as paramādityabhaktaḥ or para masauraḥ; of the Goddess (Bhagavatī) as paraṁ bhagavatībhaktaḥ; of the Buddha  
as paramasaugataḥ or paramatāthāgataḥ; and of the Jaina Arhats as paramārhataḥ or paramajainaḥ.100 
However, it was rarely the case that a king’s publicly declared allegiance to  
one or another of these traditions was accompanied by strict exclusivity of pa 
tronage. For while a king might favour one religion over another, say Vaiṣṇavism  
over Śaivism, it was common, and no doubt politic, for him to extend support  
to religious traditions other than his own. Thus, the Kārkoṭakas of Kashmir,  
who following the Śaiva kings of the Hephthalite Hun dynasty that had ruled  
the country from early in the sixth century101 held power from the seventh to the

ninth centuries, were consistently devotees of Viṣṇu, offering no support to the  
cult of Śiva, yet they also supported Buddhism and the cult of the Sun.102 
Similarly, the Maitrakas of Valabhī were consistently Śaiva from the sixth to  
the eighth centuries, yet, as we know from their copper-plate grants, Xuanzang,  
and the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa, they were also generous patrons of Buddhism; 103 
and the Pālas of Bihar and Bengal, though Buddhists, continued to support  
Śaivism and Vaiṣṇavism,104 as did the Candras of Arakan; 105 the predominantly  
Śaiva Licchavi and ṭhākurī kings of Nepal were generous patrons of Bud dhism; 106 and simultaneous royal patronage of Śaivism and Buddhism was also a  
conspicuous feature of religion in mainland Southeast Asia, in the kingdoms of  
the Khmers, Chams, Sumatrans, Sundanese, and Javanese.107 
In the south of India too we find examples of royal patronage of more than  
one religious tradition. The Pallava Mahendravarman I Guṇabhara was a Śaiva  
convert from Jainism if we may believe the Tamil Śaiva hagiography. As a Śaiva  
he established rock-cut cave temples of Śivas with his biruda names: Śatrum 
alleśvara at Dal˙avānūr,108 Avanibhājanapallaveśvara at Śīyamaṅgalam,109 and Lal 
102. See Sanderson 2009a, p. 73. 
103. In the Alīnā copper-plate inscription of Śīlāditya VI Dhrūbhaṭa of ad 766 (cii 3:39) the account of  
the Maitraka lineage jumps from the Śaiva founder, Bhaṭārka, over the next four generations, which we  
know from other inscriptions to have included a Vaiṣṇava and a Saura, to Guhasena. He and his thirteen  
descendants down to Śīlāditya VI are identified as paramamāheśvaraḥ, with the exception of Śīlāditya  
IV and Śīlāditya VI, who are given no sectarian epithet. For the Maitrakas patronage of Buddhism (in  
its pre-Tantric forms) see Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa 53.538–549; and Xuanzang on the recent conversion of  
the king of Valabhī to Buddhism (Beal 1884, vol. 2. p. 267). Of the land-grant documents of the Maitrakas  
of Valabhī three quarters are records of grants to brahmins, but the remaining quarter report grants  
made by these kings to Buddhist institutions (Schmiedchen 2007, p. 360). On the Maitrakas support of  
Buddhism see Sanderson 2009a, pp. 72–73.

itāṇkurapallaveśvara Tiruchirāpal˙l˙i.110 Yet he also excavated a rock-cut temple of  
Viṣṇu with his name (Mahendraviṣṇu) in his town of Mahendrapura.111 We find  
the same phenomenon in the dynasty of the Eastern Gaṅgas of Kaliṅganagara in  
northern Andhra Pradesh, a line all of whose known rulers, from the first half of  
the sixth century through to the end of our period, were declared devout worship 
pers of Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ). An inscription issued in year 79 of the Gaṅga  
era, which is to say, c. ad 578, records that Mahārāja Hastivarman Raṇabhīta of  
this line made a land-grant for the support of a temple of a Viṣṇu incorporating  
his name (Raṇabhītodaya) in spite of the declaration that the donor is a para mamāheśvaraḥ.112 The Hoysal˙a king Viṣṇuvardhana (r. 1110–1141) likewise, though  
strongly influenced by the Śrīvaiṣṇava movement, was also a generous patron of  
both Jainism and Śaivism.113 
There were even kings whose inscriptions depart from the convention of de 
claring allegiance to a single tradition by declaring them ‘entirely devoted’ to both  
Śiva and Viṣṇu. This is true of the Pallava Narasiṁhavarman II (r. c. 700–728),114 
the Gaṅga Anantavarman Coḍagaṅga in his Korni plates of 1081/2,115 Vaidyadeva  
of Prāgjyotiṣa in his copper-plate grant probably of 1142,116 and Jayabhañja of the  
Bhañjas of Kolāḍa in the eleventh or twelfth century.117 
We also have evidence from the Khmer realm that there were Vaiṣṇava dig nitaries within the predominantly Śaiva royal staff, that members of the same  
family could be of different religious allegiances, and that the state limited the  
freedom of individuals to change their religion only in the special case of persons

from certain title-groups (varṇa) who had been selected for training as Śaiva offi ciants in the service of the king and were forbidden by a decree of Jayavarman V  
(r. c. 970–1000) to become Vaiṣṇavas.118 
There are also numerous instances of royal marriages across religious bound 
aries in the subcontinent. In the fourth century the Vākāṭakas Rudrasena I  
(r. c. 335–360) and Pr̥thivīsena I (r. c. 360–395) were Śaivas.119 But c. 388 their suc cessor Rudrasena II (r. c. 395–405) married Prabhāvatīguptā, the daughter of the  
Gupta emperor Candragupta II (r. 376–415), a princess who in accordance with  
the religious preference of her paternal family was a devotee of Viṣṇu (atyant abhagavadbhaktā). Though Rudrasena continued to support the faith of his pre 
decessors, he declared himself a Vaiṣṇava, no doubt under her influence,120 and  
developed Rāmagiri (Ramtek) as a Vaiṣṇava state temple-complex. 
We have other examples in Kalhaṇa’s Rājataraṅgiṇī. As we have seen above,  
at the end of the ninth century, after the demise of the Vaiṣṇava Kārkoṭaka dy nasty, Śaṇkaravarman (883–902) was a devout worshipper of Śiva and accordingly  
founded Śiva temples with his and his queen’s names. But his queen Sugandhā, a  
foreigner from the north, probably a Dard (5.157), was a supporter of the Vaiṣṇava  
Pāñcarātrikas,121 and while she occupied the throne from 904 to 906 after the  
death of her husband and the short reigns of her sons, the boy king Gopālavar 
man (902–904) and his younger brother Saṁkaṭa (904), she established a Viṣṇu  
Gopālakeśava and a Gopālamaṭha with the former’s name (5.244). Moreover,  
Nandā, Gopālavarman’s child bride, no doubt chosen for him by his Vaiṣṇava  
mother, founded a Viṣṇu (Nandā)keśava and a Nandāmaṭha with hers (5.245). 
After the end of the rule of this dynasty in 939 the brahmins bestowed the  
crown on Yaśaskaravarman (939–948), the son of Prabhākaradeva, the trea 
surer of Gopālavarman, and the the secret lover of his Vaiṣṇava queen Sugandhā

(5.469–477). This paramour may well have been the unnamed royal functionary  
rumoured122 to have been a supporter, like the queen, of the Vaiṣṇava Pāñcarātri kas. In any case his son Yaśaskaravarman was a Vaiṣṇava and one who exerted  
himself to encourage orthopraxy and suppress the Śākta-leaning Śaivism then  
strong in Kashmir (6.6–12, 108–112). He began the construction of a temple for  
a Viṣṇu Yaśaskarasvāmin, incorporating his own name, but died before it was  
finished (6.140). 
His successor Parvagupta (949–950) was a Śaiva, as we may infer from the  
fact that he established a Śiva Parvagupteśvara (6.137) and at the end of his life  
chose to die in the precincts of the Śaiva temple of the Sureśvarīkṣetra (6.147). His  
religious conviction would not then have predisposed him to complete the Viṣṇu  
temple of his anti-Śaiva Vaiṣṇava predecessor, but he was tricked into doing so  
by one of Yaśaskaravarman’s widows, no doubt another Vaiṣṇava, who promised  
him her favours if he did so and then when he had completed the work, commit 
ted pious suicide by offering herself into a sacrificial fire (6.140–144). 
Parvagupta was succeeded by Kṣemagupta (950–958), whose Śaiva persuasion  
can be seen from the report that he founded a temple for a Śiva Ardhanārīśvara  
under the name Kṣemagaurīśvara (6.172–173). But he married Diddā, the ruthless  
and dissolute daughter of Siṁharāja, the Śāhi chief of Lohara, a mountainous dis trict adjoining Kashmir on the south-west (6.176). Again a matrimonial alliance  
favoured Viṣṇu. It was probably through her influence – the king was so besotted  
with her that he was mockingly known as Diddākṣema (6.177) – that when he  
fell fatally ill he chose to go to die in the Vaiṣṇava holy site Varāhakṣetra (6.186).  
During her long dominance of nearly fifty years until 1008 she enshrined a Viṣṇu  
Abhimanyusvāmin with the name of her deceased son Abhimanyu (6.299), two  
Viṣṇus Diddāsvāmin with her own name (6.300, 302), and a Viṣṇu Siṁhasvāmin  
in Lohara (8.1822) with the name of her father (6.304); and her illustrious ma 
ternal grandfather Bhīma, the Śāhi king of Udabhāṇḍa (Hund) on the Indus,  
enshrined and richly endowed a Viṣṇu Bhīmasvāmin with his name in Kashmir  
proper, at Bumzu near Bavan (6.178).

Nor does it seem that Indian courts were less tolerant than the Khmer when  
it came to the religion of their members. It seems not to have been the case, for  
example, that a Śaiva could not aspire to ministerial office under a Vaiṣṇava king.  
We have a striking example of this at the beginning of our period at Udayagiri  
near the ancient city of Vidiśā in central India, where an inscription records that  
Vīrasena, a minister of the Vaiṣṇava (paramabhāgavataḥ) Gupta emperor Can dragupta II (r. c. 375–415), had a cave excavated for Śiva when he had come there  
with that monarch while the latter was engaged in a military campaign.123 
The state’s support for religions other than that professed by the monarch in  
the inscriptions issued by his chancellery is also clear from evidence of his par 
ticipation in their major festivals. Xuanzang’s Da Tang Xiyuji, the account of his  
journey to and sojourn in India from 629 (var. 627) to 645 (var. 644), completed in  
646 on his return to China, tells us that in the vicinity of the city of Kanyakubja  
(Kanauj) were a Buddhist monastery, a temple of the Sun-God, and a temple of  
Śiva, all three of similar scale and grandeur; 124 and Huili and Yanzong’s biogra 
phy of this learned Chinese pilgrim (Da ci en si san cang fa shi zhuan), completed  
in 688, reports that in Kanyakubja during the Buddhist quinquennial festival  
of the general distribution of alms (pañcavarṣapariṣat), the Puṣyabhūti emperor  
Harṣa, whose Śaiva allegiance is reported by his biographer Bāṇa,125 offered wor ship to the Buddha on the first day, to the Sun-God on the second, and to Ma 
heśvara (Śiva) on the third.126 This multi-faith environment, with several equally  
balanced religious traditions flourishing side by side, is, I propose, the probable  
cause of the great inconstancy of the declared religious allegiance of the kings  
of this once great city, seen first among the Puṣyabhūtis and then among the  
Gurjara-Pratīhāras. Among the Puṣyabhūtis the emperor Harṣa, as we have seen,  
123. cii 3:6, l. 5: ‘[Vīrasena, Minister of Peace and War of Candragupta] had this cave constructed out of  
devotion for the god Śambhu when he had come to this place together with the king himself, who was  
seeking to conquer the entire world (kr̥tsnapr̥thvījayārtthena rājñaiveha sahāgataḥ).’

was a Śaiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ); but his father was a Buddhist (paramasaugataḥ),  
and three preceding ascendants were Sauras (paramādityabhaktaḥ); 127 and among  
the Gurjara-Pratīhāras we have successively the Vaiṣṇava Devaśakti, the Śaiva  
Vatsarāja, the Śākta Nāgabhaṭa (r. c. 816–834), the Saura Rāmabhadra, the Śākta  
Bhoja (r. c. 840–890), the Saura Vināyakapāla, and the Śaiva Mahendrapāla.128 
We may also point to socio-legal provisions at the eastern edge of the Indic  
world, in East Java during the Majapahit period (1293–c. 1500). We know that  
the state appointed clerical administrators of religion (dharmādhyakṣa) for both  
the Śaiva (dharmādhyakṣa riṇ kaśaiwan) and Buddhist faiths (dharmādhyakṣa riṇ kasogatan), providing official residences for them close to the royal compound,  
and that there was a board of subordinate religious officials known as the Asses 
sors of Religion (dharmopapatti, dharmādhikaraṇa), who included persons adher ing to the non-Saiddhāntika Bhairava cult (bhairawapakṣa) and the Saura cult of  
the Sun (sorapakṣa).129 
Persecution 
The emergence of the orthoprax consensus reported by Jayanta and confirmed  
by other evidence, in which Vaidikas, Vaiṣṇavas, and Śaivas were seen by oth ers and themselves as equipolent aspects of a single loosely defined faith, the ju 
ridical view that all religions other than those considered criminal or subversive  
should be accepted by the state, and the evidence of royal patronage extended  
to religious traditions other than those to which monarchs claimed to be espe 
cially devoted suggest that there was indeed a high degree of official tolerance of  
religious diversity to be found in the various states of early mediaeval India. But  
the evidence presented above also shows that this tolerance was not innate to  
the individual traditions that had been absorbed, however incompletely, into this  
consensus. The Vaidikas, as we have seen, had a strictly exclusivist view that, if it  
could have found the support of willing monarchs, would have driven all compet

itors for royal patronage from the field; and we have seen that Śaiva ideologues  
for their part, while claiming to support the Vaidika tradition within an inclu 
sive Śaiva-Vaidika socio-religious order, nonetheless show in their scriptures and  
learned commentaries an uncompromising faith in the otherness and superiority  
of Śaivism and the marked inferiority of the Vaidika system, which they saw as  
merely ‘mundane religion’ (laukiko dharmaḥ).130 The Buddhists and Jainas likewise  
stood in clear opposition to the ‘Hindu’ traditions, even though Buddhist kings at  
least have professed in their inscriptions their commitment to the preservation of  
the Vaidika socio-religious order; 131 and the Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas, and Vaidikas have  
been unanimous in their condemnation of these two heterodox faiths. In this at  
least they could agree. 
Consequently, it was always a possibility that the peaceful co-existence of  
these competing traditions might be upset, if a royal patron or charismatic re 
ligious figure found himself eager and able, for whatever reason – political, eco 
nomic, or perhaps even simple religious conviction – not merely to favour one  
tradition at the expense of others, but even to persecute whatever tradition he was  
inclined to suppress, or at least punish anyone who dared to raise a voice against  
the dominant religious consensus of the region and period. Consider the strident  
tone of the following declaration in an inscription of ad 1036 recording a grant of  
land made by Jayasiṁha II, the Cālukya ruler of Kalyāṇa, for the support of the  
temple of Śiva Pañcaliṅgeśvara, to Lakulīśvara, evidently in his capacity as the  
Lākula incumbent of this sacred site: 132 
I, a fire of destruction to disputants [of other faiths], shall place my foot in  
the presence of the king’s council on the head of any who claims that either  
of these is false: the God Śiva, whose feet merit the worship of all men, and  
130. See, e.g., describing the ideal Śaiva Sthāpaka, Devyāmata f. 1v3 [2.20ab]: ‘With no attachment to  
the mundane religion, devoted [only] to the religion of Śiva’ (virakto laukike dharme śivadharmānurañ 
jitaḥ). 
131. See Sanderson 2009a, pp. 115–117, for the epigraphical evidence of this commitment.

the religion proclaimed in the three [Vedas], in which the system of the caste 
classes and disciplines has been established in its proper hierarchy. 
Consider also the following passage from an authoritative South Indian Said 
dhāntika Śaiva treatise of the twelfth century, which tells the Śaivas that they  
may kill without sin anyone who attacks their faith: 133 
Even if he kills those who revile Śiva, the Mantras of Śiva, and his Gurus, he  
does not thereby infringe the rules of his post-initiatory discipline. There is no  
fault in killing those who attack [our] deities, sacred fire, and teachers. 
Nor do our historical sources lack accounts of persecutions, pogroms, or sim 
ple vandalism directed against the religious other. Some may be fictions or at least  
exaggerated. But some are well attested and by their mere existence they proclaim  
that the Indians of our period were not adherents of the view that the religions  
around them were eirenic by nature. 
Buddhist sources, from the Kashmirian Vibhāṣā of the second century to the  
East Indian Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa of the eighth, identify as the first major perse 
cutor of their religion Puṣyamitra Śuṅga of the second century bc, the brahmin  
general who was believed to have re-established the pre-eminence of Brahmanism  
after bringing the pro-Buddhist Maurya dynasty to an end. According to these  
works he burned the Buddhist Sūtras, demolished Stūpas and monasteries, and  
killed many Buddhist monks, from Magadha to Jālandhara.134 
Xuanzang, the seventh-century Chinese Buddhist scholar monk, who spent  
about fifteen years in Central Asia and India, reports that the Hephthalite Hun  
Mihirakula, who ruled in Kashmir early in the sixth century, destroyed many  
Buddhist foundations in Gandhāra, having resolved to extinguish Buddhism.135 
He was evidently Śaiva in allegiance, since on his coins he had the bull and tri

dent and the legend jayatu vr̥ṣa jayatu vr̥ṣadhvaja ‘Victory to the Bull! Victory to  
[Śiva,] who has the Bull as his emblem!’,136 and, according to Kalhaṇa, established  
a Liṅga of Śiva incorporating his name (Mihireśvara) in the capital.137 It should  
be noted, however, that Kalhaṇa says nothing of persecution of the Buddhists  
in particular but notes only that before the close of his life he had been a pitiless  
monster responsible for countless deaths.138 
Xuanzang also reports the persecution of the Buddhists by the East Indian  
ruler Śaśāṇka (c. 603–619/20). He tells us that this king attacked the religion  
of Buddha, dispersed the Saṅgha, cut down the Bodhi tree, damaged the rock  
nearby that bore the Buddha’s footprints, and ordered that a Buddha image  
there should be replaced by an image of Śiva.139 He too was a devout worshipper  
of this deity (paramamāheśvaraḥ),140 and his gold coins show Śiva reclining on  
his bull.141

to the Buddhist Tantric Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa, probably not long after Gopāla’s  
136. Stein 1979 on 1.289. To laud the bull (vr̥ṣaḥ) would be surprising if the intended meaning were the  
bull that is Śiva’s mount, but not if the word is intended in its figurative meaning, namely dharmaḥ or  
sukr̥tam ‘the virtuous actions [prescribed by the Veda].’ For this meaning of vr̥ṣaḥ see, for example,  
Amarasiṁha, Nāmaliṅgānuśāsana 1.4.25b (sukr̥taṁ vr̥ṣaḥ), 3.3.220 (sukr̥te vr̥ṣabhe vr̥ṣaḥ); Halāyudha,  
Abhidhānaratnamālā 1.125cd (dharmaḥ puṇyaṁ vr̥ṣaḥ śreyaḥ sukr̥taṁ ca samaṁ smr̥tam); Manusmr̥ti 
816a (vr̥ṣo hi bhagavān dharmas . . .); and the Gwalior Museum Stone Inscription of Pataṅgaśambhu  
(Mirashi 1962), l. 15, vr̥ṣaikaniṣṭho ’pi jitasmaro ’pi yaḥ śaṇkaro ’bhūd bhuvi ko ’py apūrvvaḥ, concerning  
the Śaiva ascetic Vyomaśambhu: ‘He was in the world an extraordinary new Śiva, since he too was  
vr̥ṣaikaniṣṭhaḥ (‘devoted solely to pious observance’; in Śiva’s case ‘riding only on the Bull’) and he  
too was jitasmaraḥ (‘one who had defeated sensual urges’; in Śiva’s case ‘the defeater of the Love god  
Kāmadeva’). This is also the meaning of vr̥ṣaḥ in the title Vr̥ṣasārasaṁgraha, one of the works of the  
Śivadharma corpus (see, e.g., Sanderson 2014, p. 2), i.e., ‘Summary of the Essentials of the [Śiva]dharma’.

reign,142 reports that in Vārāṇasī a king of Gauḍa called Soma, perhaps the  
Sāmanta-Mahārāja Soma/Somadatta, the feudatory of Śaśāṇka recorded in an  
inscription of c. 620,143 destroyed Buddha images; had the Buddhist scriptures  
burned; obliterated Buddhist monasteries, assembly grounds, and Stūpas; and  
blocked their endowments.144 
In the twelfth or thirteenth century an inscription from the royal town of  
Vodāmayūtā in Haryana praises a Saiddhāntika Śaiva ascetic from Aṇahi lapāṭaka called Varmaśiva who had been appointed head of the Śaiva Maṭha in  
Vodāmayūtā by the minister of the great-grandfather of the present ruler, relat 
ing that when he had gone to the Deccan as a boy he had seen an image installed  
by the Buddhists and in his fury had by some mysterious means succeeded in  
carrying it off to a great distance.145 
The Pallava Mahendravarman I (c. 610–630), originally a Jaina, is thought  
to have persecuted the Śaivas until he was converted to Śaivism by the Tamil  
poet-saint Appar.146 Appar declares himself a convert from Jainism and his po 
etry, like that of his near contemporary Campantar, is full of vituperation both  
against his former co-religionists and the Buddhists.147 After his conversion from  
Jainism to Śaivism the Pāṇḍya king of Madurai is said to have had 8,000 Jainas  
impaled in revenge for an attempt to kill his Śaiva Guru Campantar.148 Whatever  
the degree of accuracy of this grotesque claim it is significant that this massacre is  
depicted in relief around the enclosure of the tank of the temple of Mīnākṣisund areśvara in Madurai and celebrated to this day in its festivals.149

An inscription of c. 1200 at Ablūr, a Jaina stronghold in the Dharwar district  
of Karnataka,150 reports a conflict between Jainas and Śaivas towards the end of  
the twelfth century that culminated in the destruction of a Jaina temple and its  
image of the Jina and the construction in its place of the temple of Śiva Vīraso 
manātha (/Someśvara) by the Śaiva zealot Ekāntada-Rāmayya; and inscriptions  
at Shravana Belgola and other places in Karṇāṭaka record that in 1368 the Jainas  
appealed successfully to the king of Vijayanagar for protection from persecution  
at the hands of Vaiṣṇavas.151 
There is also an inscription of ad 1184 from Talikoti in the Mudehihal Taluk  
of Bijapur District on a pillar near the gateway of the fort, which records that the  
Gaṇas of the temple of Vīra-Bayseśvara established the glory of the god Śiva with  
supreme valour by destroying the Buddhist and Jaina religions, vanquishing the  
adherents of the rival faiths at many places near and far, demolishing Jaina tem 
ples, and installing Liṅgas of Śiva.152 Nor was this kind of sectarian hatred limited  
to the south. In 1174, Ajayadeva, the Śaiva king of Gujarat who founded Ajmer, is  
said to have begun his reign with a severe persecution of the Jainas.153 
There is also evidence of hostility between Śaivas and Vaiṣṇavas. An inscrip tion of 1160 at Tirukkaḍaiyūr rules that devotees of Śiva (Māheśvaras) associated  
with the temple there would forfeit their property to the temple if they mixed  
freely with Vaiṣṇavas.154 The South Indian Vaiṣṇava Yāmuna (c. 966/7 to 1038)  
is uncompromising in his view that the Śaiva faith is outside the pale of valid  
religion155 and that, against appearances, orthoprax Vaidika criticism of inner  
non-Vaidika practice applies only to Śaivism and not also to the Vaiṣṇava Pañ

carātra; 156 and this view was not moderated by the later Vaiṣṇavas of southern  
India, who held firmly to the position that the Mantramārgic Śaivas and the  
Pāśupatas were infidels (avaidikāḥ, pāṣaṇḍinaḥ) the very sight of whom pol lutes.157 Then there is the Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiographical tradition of works such as  
the Divyasūricarita of Garuḍavāhana and the Yatirājavaibhava of Vaṭuka Nampi,  
according to which their teacher Rāmānuja had to flee because of persecution by  
the fanatically Śaiva Col˙a emperor, finding refuge in Karṇāṭaka, where he con verted the Jaina Hoysal˙a king Biṭṭideva to Vaiṣṇavism,158 and the tradition of the  
Divyasūricarita that the same king, or Kulottuṅga II (r. 1133–1150), according to  
his court poet Oṭṭakūttan, had an image of Viṣṇu removed from the front of the  
shrine of Śiva Naṭarāja in Cidambaram and thrown into the sea.159 Whatever the  
truth of this claim, it was strongly believed.160 
Only accounts of religious persecution or killing of non-Buddhists by Bud 
dhists are lacking in the Indian sources known to me.161 Their aggression, as far as  
I can tell at present, was limited in India to the provision of Mantras to be used  
to kill the enemies of Buddhism; 162 to narratives of the forcible humiliation of  
156. Āgamaprāmāṇya, pp. 156–158.

159. Sastri 1984: pp. 300 and 644–645. 
160.Finally, in 1539 Acyutarāya of Vijayanagara, a Vaiṣṇava like all the post-Saṅgama kings of this dy nasty, responded to this belief by founding the present shrine of Viṣṇu Govindarāja within the precincts  
of the temple, right beside the Citsabhā, the Śaivas’ holy of holies, ordaining that it should be wor 
shipped according to the ritual of the Vaikhānasas (Younger 1995, pp. 111–112). 
161. This is not the case in Tibet. In his Blue Annals (tr. Roerich 1995, p. 53) Gzhon nu dpal relates that  
the Buddhist monk Lha lung dpal gyi rdo rje assassinated Glang dar ma, the last king of the Yarlung  
dynasty, c. ad 842, to put an end to his persecution of Buddhism. For a colourful and no doubt fictional 
ized account of the assassination, see Bsod nams rgyal tshan’s Rgyal rabs gsal ba’i me long (fourteenth  
century), tr. by Sørensen (1994), pp. 431–435. I merely cite the tradition. For there are grounds for  
doubting both Glang dar ma’s hostility to Buddhism and his assassination; see Yamaguchi 1996.

the teaching (duṣṭarājñāṁ śāsanāpakāriṇāṁ ca sattvānāṁ). . .’; ‘to protect the teaching of the Buddhas,

the canonization of these narratives in the iconography of their Tantric deities,  
who tread triumphant on the prostrate bodies of their Śaiva rivals, and wear their  
flayed skin as garments and their bones as Kāpālika ornaments.163
