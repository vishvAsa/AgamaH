      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;beef-eating-prohibition&#34;&gt;Beef eating prohibition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The men of the cities of Marea and Apis, in the part of Egypt bordering on Libya, believing themselves to be Libyans and not Egyptians, and disliking the injunction of the religious law that forbade them to eat cows&amp;rsquo; meat, sent to Ammon saying that they had no part of or lot with Egypt: for they lived (they said) outside the Delta and did not consent to the ways of its people, and they wished to be allowed to eat all foods. [3] But the god forbade them: all the land, he said, watered by the Nile in its course was Egypt, and all who lived lower down than the city Elephantine and drank the river&amp;rsquo;s water were Egyptians. Such was the oracle given to them. 19.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
