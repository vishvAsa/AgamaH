Known as the purer ones, the high priests of ancient egypt, both male and female bathed in the holy lake in the temple twice daily -- morning and, at night. they removed all their body hair using razors. 

A clean mouth was important as they were to speak the words before the gods, so they used natron salt. they wore reed woven sandals, robes of pure white linen, even used metal mirrors.
