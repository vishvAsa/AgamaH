The shruti has various versions of "Atmastuti-s," where the yajamAna speaks as indra, varuNa or himself has an experience encompassing divinity or an experience of macranthropic polytheism (e.g., "ahaM rudrebhiH ..." = vAg Atmastuti). We see an Egyptian expression resembling that in Ani's papyrus of the Book of the Dead. Could it be seen as a soteriological destination of the Egyptian (c.f. tropes found in the vAg-Atmastuti, anna-stuti of bhR^igu in the taittirIya shruti, etc.):

> ‘What will you live on?’ say the gods and spirits to me.  
 ‘I will live and have power through bread.’   
‘Where will you eat it?’ say the gods and spirits to me.   
‘I will have power and I will eat it under the branches of the tree of Hathor my mistress, who made offering of bread, beer, and corn in Heliopolis. I will don a loincloth from the hand of Tayt, I will dwell in the place where I wish to be.’ 
>
> ‘My head is that of Re who is united with Atum, the four suns of the length of the land;  
> I have gone forth, for my tongue is that of Ptah, my throat is that of Hathor, for I have recalled with my mouth the speech of Atum to my father when he destroyed the majesty of the wife of Geb,  
> whose head was broken at his word.  
> Be afraid thereat and report it, the outcry at my strength.  
> There shall be assigned to me the heritage of the Lord of the Earth, namely Geb, and I shall be cared for thereby;  
> Geb shall refresh me, for he has given to me his appearings in glory.  
> Those who are in Heliopolis bow their heads to me, for I am their lord, I am their bull.  
> I am mightier than the Lord of Terror; I copulate and I have power over myriads.’
