In the shruti and late vaidika tradition, there are several a~nganyAsa-s, a theme which continues into the Agamika tradition. One example in the late vaidika tradition is the laghunyAsa of bodhAyana: prajanane brahmA tiShThatu | ... ityAdi. We encounter a similar one in the papyrus of Nu from around 1400 BCE:

My hair is that of Nun,  
my face is that of Aten,  
my eyes are those of Hathor,  
my ears are those of Wepwawet,  
my nose is that of the Foremost of Khasu,  
my lips are those of Anubis,  
my teeth are those of Serqet,  
my neck is that of Isis the goddess,  
my arms are those of the Ba-soul lord of Djedet  
my front is that of Neit lady of Sais,  
my back is that of Seth,  
my penis is that of Baba,  
my flesh is that of the lords of Kheraba,  
my chest is that of the god Great of Dignity,  
my stomach and spine are those of Sekhmet,  
my buttocks are those of the Eye of Horus,  
my thighs and flanks are those of Nut,  
my legs are those of Ptah,  
my toes are those of living falcons.  
[No limb] of mine is without a god.
