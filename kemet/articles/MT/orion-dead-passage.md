## Passage
Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1975034021236105460)

The Orion region of the sky is indicated as the passage to the southern realm of the dead in an incantation from 950 BCE found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead:
 
> My ba-soul* flies up beside Orion,  
to take its place in the southern sky.  
The protection of the Chant-goddess shelters it (= the ba-soul),  
the Great Sow (=goddess Nut) shelters it, her arms behind you.  
The fighters of faces defend you,  
the soil over you is removed for you.

* The ba-soul of the Egyptians could be roughly mapped on the Atman of the H; the ka-soul would map on to the sUkShma-sharIra in H tradition.+++(5)+++

This suggests a deep homology suggesting that early Afro-Eurasiatic traditions associated the Orion region with passage into the realm of the dead.

for some IE traditions in this regard.

## Osiris
An incantation identifying the god Osiris with the constellation of Orion found in the Book of the Dead of the accountant Nefersekheru from ~1275 BCE:

> Hail, lord of justification,  
Osiris Sokar, as the master of the Shrine,  
arisen in the henu-boat as Wennefer,  
Ptah upon the sarcophagus, tall Power,  
lord of Resetjau, true of voice, who is in the sacred land,  
noble god, eternity, everlastingness is his,  
million-fold, divine, who makes the upper and the lower beings,  
[the place of whose becomings is] unkn[own],  
whose shape is hidden, whose forms are secret,  
whose chapel in the underworld is sanctified,  
lord of joy, ruler of elation,  
who conceals [himself among the gods],  
noble *Orion*, who separates sky from earth\*,  
who splits the flood by his becoming!

### Sky earth - Separation
Orion is said to separate the sky from the earth reminding one of the Indo-European bridge tradition associated with the realm of vaivasvata. Further, this allusion might refer to the ancient position of the Orion region at the equinoctial colure.
