There was a great battle between the demons and the Tengri in which the latter were defeated. They turned to Qormusta Khan Tengri (ahura mazdA), the high god, for aid. He declared that their defeat was due to them having no horse-standard and recommended that they invoke the Suelde Tengri the god of the horse-banner. Then appeared 9 divine brothers armed with swords, tiger-skin quivers and bows, the eldest of whom was Suelde Tengri, riding fiery horses (corresponding to the nine horse tails of the banner). Aided by these deities, the Tengri fought the demons and defeated them.
