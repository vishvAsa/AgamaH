The Mongol shamans of Qasar "ulus" have a refrain that ends lines of a song that goes as "höi hi ya". This reminds one of the nidhana-stobha-s of certain sAman-s. While it could be purely onomatopoeic convergence, it does make one also wonder if it might be an old steppe inheritance that spread widely across cultures.
