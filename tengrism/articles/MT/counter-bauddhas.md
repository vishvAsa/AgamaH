## Protest
Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1979395817694990692)

The Mongol shamans of the "ulus" of Chingiz Khan's brother Qasar saw the lamas and the bauddha-mata as a counter-religion destructive to their own. A Mongol black shaman's chant of protest:

After dividing the shamans into black and white /  
Lamas, you became a hindrance /  
Lamas, you deceive all /  
With your false doctrine / ,  
you came from afar /  
Sounding your bell and tambourine /  
Lamas, you do evil /  
With your untrue religion”  
-translated from the Mongolian by Elisabetta Chiodo

She notes an account of a black shaman performing an "abhichAra" rite wherein he deployed his helper ghost (ongghod) to inflict punishment on a lama. 

However, over time, these Mongol shamans incorporated the vajrayANa pantheon into the songs performed at their rites.

Sonam Gyatso's message was that the time had come for Mongolia to embrace Buddhism, that from that time on there should be no more animal sacrifices, there must be no taking of life, animal or human, military action must be pursued only with purpose and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished. He also secured an edict abolishing the Mongol custom of blood-sacrifices. These and many other such laws were set forth by Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso and were instituted by Altan Khan.
