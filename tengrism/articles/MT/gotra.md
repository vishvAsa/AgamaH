It is notable that the shamans of the "horde" of Qasar still remember Qorči böge, the shaman of the Ba'arin clan (from which the great Mongol general Bayan descended) who had predicted Chingiz Khan's meteoric rise. They see him as a founder figure of the tradition and take his name just as we would take that of bhR^igu, chyavAna, aurva,  etc.
