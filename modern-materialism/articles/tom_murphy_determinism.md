title = "Tom murphy on determinism"

There was never a point at which you (as if separate from the physical implementation of your body/brain) could insert an override to what the neurons in your body were going to do. The illusion feels like a "free" choice, but free of what, exactly? Determinism (physics)?

In my view, there is no *you* to control the neurons in your body: no separate agent, somehow apart from and above (controlling) the material workings of neurons. Sounds like the definition of a soul to me. 

The neurons are in control, and *are* you, in large part. Obeying physics, they have no freedom to do anything other than what particle interactions dictate via their arrangements and conditions. 

Granted, those arrangements and conditions are wonderfully sophisticated, evolved to permit extraordinary organism-level coherent responses to external stimuli that we can call choices ("belonging" to the organism),  
and those choices impact the external environment (thus an agent of change so that the organism possesses agency). But all proceeds according to deterministic processes beyond the control of some putative entity sitting apart.  
If nothing outside of physics comes into play (I agree), then I accept the result that we have no override to thwart the (effectively) deterministic flow.

You're illustrating the classic example of assuming there's no point if you're not in control. Your cosmology demands a point and purpose to your life.  
I would say that construction is inconsistent with the actual universe,  
yet an adaptive, convincing, and understandable mental model that may contribute to our success as a species.+++(5)+++  
It's like the utility of the mental model that a brick is solid, when in fact it's mostly empty space and only acts impenetrable via electromagnetic interaction.+++(5)+++  
The solid model might be wrong, but it's effective.

Then why do we hold people accountable for crimes?  
Because a successful social species that survives evolutionary pressures  
must develop responses (e.g., neural structures) that operate for the common good (group survival).+++(4)+++  
If a member has a "defective" mental construction that produces harmful results, the super-organism (community) must have a way to self-correct or it fails and disappears.+++(5)+++  
Evolution operates simultaneously on many levels,  
producing rather sophisticated codes for dealing with errant individuals.  
We need not hold a soul accountable (even if that's essentially how we frame it) in order to generate consequences for undesirable behavior (that presumably will enter the neural calculus as a relevant stimulus and deter such behaviors).

Why do I write and encourage people to think differently?  
It's my (neurons') response to myriad stimuli,  
producing yet more stimuli for others to consider.  
Call it part of the adaptive pro-social package I inherited:  
warning the community of a threat that they may not have perceived.+++(5)+++  
Nothing about this denies my existence,  
although I will deny that any part of my actions break rank with how my neurons react and that somehow I am their boss (they *are* me).  

I deny that I am something bigger than my arrangement (relationships, information, evolution) of parts.  
No astral plane on which *I* exist apart from and above the intricate physics pile.  
To make such a statement is to go against the consensus of our society, the bulk of whom understandably trust the very convincing illusion that we are in full control (rather than being evolved to react reasonably so that we may impact our local conditions in ways that are favorable to our survival).

We likely don't have the whole physics picture. But what are the chances that missing pieces even touch on this question? So far, nothing in the enormous list of contributions (e.g., gravity, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics) has provided support for believing consciousness can override or control the mundane stuff:  
quite the opposite, the more we learn. 

But the world does not come crashing down after abandoning the free will cosmology.  
In fact, I would say it becomes richer and more fascinating without the shortcut loophole.
