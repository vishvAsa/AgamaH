There are two parallel models of reality - one is based on historical records, archeo/population-gentics etc..; and another is based on myths and hagiography. 

Both are valid in their respective areas (the former when it comes to facts; and the latter when it comes to ritual performance and sentimental self-cultivation).

The pramANa-s are different in either case; and agreement on pramANa-s is fundamental to further vAda-s; as the ancients held.  
Hence, it would not be possible to "disprove" inferences from one model, based purely on derivations from the other model.

It is understandable that some people hold that the first model is entirely false and useless, and vice versa. I personally prefer the "both valid - but in different spheres of application" approach.
