      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.rattibha.com/thread/1624728986512416768&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In brief: While China was exceptional in applied tech in the ancient world, India fared far better than it in sciences viz medicine, theology etc. Nastika missionaries empowered by successive favorable regimes in NW took these sciences there &amp;amp; armed with superior magic &amp;amp; medicine – won much fame which was followed by conversion of elites &amp;amp; favors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than theorizing, a 1st-hand account from a 17C Buryat, Shaman explains this very well:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unrollthread.com/t/1491100016861413376/&#34;&gt;AryAMsha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Who would’ve thought that the Bible Belt will turn out to be more religious than Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain a hundred years ago. &amp;ldquo;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of the founding stock Prot zealots?&amp;rdquo; Yes, but the Puritans were gone even before the Revolutionary War started. Puritans &amp;gt; Yankees &amp;gt; Unitarians You can trace the progression of individual Puritan families from theocracy to global protestantism to universalist unitarianism (c.f - Beecher family) Fundamentalist scriptural literalists would be a good way to define Baptists. It’s weird how they combine aspects of modernity with Biblical Fundamentalism. Look at their auditorium style theatre churches, christian music festivals &amp;amp; christian rock music for example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;François Bernier, &amp;ldquo;Lettre à Monsieur Chapelain” (1667).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I said to them [the Indians] about this, that in the cold countries it would be impossible to observe their law [on bathing] during the winter, which was a sign that it was a pure human invention, they gave me this rather amusing response: that they did not claim that their law was universal; that God had made it for them and it was for that reason that they could not receive a foreigner into their religion; that for the rest, they did not claim at all that our [religion] was false; and that it might well be that it was good for us and that God had created different paths to go to heaven, but that they did not wish to accept that our [religion] being valid for all of the earth, theirs was nothing more than a fable and pure invention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Rjrasva on TW&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I read from Eric Kaufmann and Michael Blume is that in first world industrialized countries the optimal strategy for growth is what they call &amp;ldquo;preach and breed&amp;rdquo; i.e., missions in the early days to form a core group of committed members, followed by erection of some barriers against the outside secular world, and maintenance of a high birth rate. Blume had once shared a research paper which concluded this but I can no longer find it as he took down his old blog posts. Their explanation is that groups like Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses that evangelize a lot also tend to lose out a lot because outsiders (as in the new converts) often bring in outside/secular influences consciously or not. These barriers also connect with what Kaufmann calls strong religion and Richard Sosis research on costly signaling. Paradoxically its the most liberal/few rules churches and religious groups that seem to lose the most members to secularization while religious groups that require you to make an effort and invest your time and follow rules have stronger retention rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
