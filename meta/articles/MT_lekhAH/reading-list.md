In general these are texts I'd recommend educated religiously inclined H to study texts of heathen cultures comparable to ours:

- 1. the yasht-s of the old Iranians; then others in order:
- 2. The Homeric hymns & thereafter the Orphic hymns & the hymns of Proclus.
- 3. The Iguvine tablets, Vergil Herculean hymn, Carmen Arvale.
- 4. Aspects of the Poetic Edda.
- 5. Papyri Graecae Magicae
- 6. Hittite incantation texts.
- 6. Egyptian Book of Dead & temple texts;
- 7. Hymn to Enlil etc Mesopotamian material.

While I'd not endorse everything in them:
Darwin’s Cathedral by DS Wilson and How Religion Evolved by Dunbar provide a reasonable foundation for evolutionary argument for why religion/religiosity might have been selected for under the frame work of natural selection. Wilson's group selectionism has been opposed by many evolutionists but I personally find value in his arguments. I think H are a genuine example of it.
