The Bon religion of Tibet is a mystery in many ways: 

1. Some see it as having genuine pre-bauddha elements that were laterally influenced by bauddha presence -- e.g., iconography. 
2. Others see it being a reactionary religion that emerged as an alternative to the tAthAgata-mata but tried to establish its legitimacy by presenting itself as endogenous.

Could the pre-bauddha elements have been influenced by a H diffusion from greater India? That is a question that the rare bonologists simply fail to ask. We do not claim it is an established fact but believe it is a valid point to be explored.

I can't claim to have done any detailed study of this practice to sound definitive but certain aspects of it gave a strong para-Mongolic vibe that might deserve more investigation.
